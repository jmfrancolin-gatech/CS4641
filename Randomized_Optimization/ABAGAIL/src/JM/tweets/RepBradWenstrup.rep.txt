Watch and read my @SpectrumNews1OH report‚Ä¶ A secure border ensures the health and safety of all Americans #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/5pcWfd7PhF Border security is a key component of our national security, the common defense, and homeland security. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/SKlhHwGAsg Sometime between 9/11 and today, our conversation about border security got muddled. The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes ‚Äì all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of immigration policy.

However, open or unsecure borders put the lawless ahead of those who play by the rules. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/YZDuzSqydQ Funding for border security shouldn‚Äôt be a political point.

Without a wall, we leave room for drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other threats to enter our country. We must secure our borders to know who and what is coming into our country. #SecureOurBorder 60,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended crossing the border last month. We need a wall and increased border security to help enforce and strengthen our nation‚Äôs legal immigration processes. #SecureOurBorder Both parties agree that we have a border security crisis but Republicans also have an answer.
