Had a wonderful time at the annual Great Meredith Ice Fishing Derby. Congratulations to the Meredith Rotary Club for another successful event. Good luck to all of the derby participants, and stay warm and safe out there! https://t.co/CkGFXa6U80 All hospitals need to have staff trained to treat sexual assault survivors and help them seek justice. I'm joining in reintroducing bipartisan legislation to help ensure that survivors can more easily access quality care by expanding and standardizing training for providers. Today Newfields unveiled a new solar array, which will help promote sustainability and save taxpayers thousands in costs every year. I'm proud to support this project and efforts like it to build a clean energy future and combat climate change. https://t.co/0hqMJPBRa9 Women must be able to make their own reproductive health choices. 
 
This was the right decision. Courts‚Äã must continue to uphold the fundamental rights of women and permanently overturn the Louisiana law.https://t.co/v3wwqqn2wx Our country faces ever-evolving cybersecurity threats, and it's critical we have a strong federal workforce to help combat those threats. I've joined in reintroducing a bipartisan bill that will help develop our cyber workforce: https://t.co/VL0CQTDrd6 The first duty of government is to protect its citizens, and that means continuing to strengthen our counterterrorism efforts. I reintroduced bipartisan legislation with @marcorubio to ensure that all parts of @DHSgov are coordinating effectively to combat terrorist threats. By reinstating the Global Gag Rule, the President is risking the health and safety of women around the world. I'm proud to cosponsor the Global HER Act to repeal the Gag Rule and help ensure that women across the world can control their own reproductive destinies. #Fight4HER Read more about the bipartisan CREATES Act here: https://t.co/CLEviiDBvQ Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are unacceptable, and so are the shady practices some drug companies use to block lower-cost generics from entering the market. I'm joining in reintroducing bipartisan legislation that will prohibit these practices and lower costs. Members of our armed services who earned Medals of Honor or were held as prisoners of war deserve a full military honors burial ceremony -- regardless of their rank. I've joined @SenTomCotton and @SenWarren in introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure that they do. Thank you to @SenatorShaheen, @SenMarkey and @SenSanders for joining me in introducing the NET METER Act in the Senate and @RepCardenas and @RepLowenthal for introducing companion legislation in the House to help protect our environment and bring down energy costs. Today I reintroduced my NET METER Act, which will help provide guidance to states that are looking to grow their renewable energy markets. As communities continue to grapple with climate change, we must keep working to build a stronger clean energy future. .@CADCA does incredible work every day to help prevent alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse in our communities and I was deeply honored to receive this award. https://t.co/gUZmY3YDPy My full statement on President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address: https://t.co/odcEVA0rDB Heading to the State of the Union address.

I'm proud to join in reintroducing a bill that will help continue to protect this watershed for generations to come. https://t.co/yIH2sxSPrO Far too many Americans have received surprise medical bills for care they thought was in their insurance network. Donna is one of them, and she's joining me for tonight's #SOTU to help draw attention to this absurd practice. https://t.co/o1gKNJ8rGy Prescription drug costs are out of control. These pharmaceutical CEOs need to show up and testify before us on the @SenateFinance committee. Thank you @RonWyden and @ChuckGrassley. https://t.co/u0sbBXSmzI Thank you for having me!

Donna received a surprise medical bill for care she thought was in her insurance network.

Meanwhile, a former Koch executive is now helping craft the federal government's response to PFAS contamination. This is beyond outrageous.
https://t.co/F5g3opso3o Far too many school buildings in the United States are not getting the investment they need and that must change. I helped introduce a bill that will help provide the next generation with the modern school infrastructure they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. Today I visited Hitchiner Manufacturing to hear about the impact the Trump Administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum are having on N.H. businesses. I've introduced legislation to help relieve the burden that these tariffs have imposed and to help protect our state's economy. https://t.co/dpJ3JjRJHI RT @NH_Troopers: K-9 Ragnar is excited about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl! https://t.co/kYUVlJlVe1 Just another Sunday in New England. üêê #StillHere Getting dinner going before the big game ‚Äî wearing one of my lucky Red Sox hats to keep the championship vibe going.

Congrats to all of the award winners and show exhibitors and thank you to our hard-working farmers and forest industry professionals. We need the best minds at @DHSgov and in the private sector working together to fend off cyberattacks. My bipartisan bill with @senrobportman will help encourage that collaboration and strengthen our cyber defenses. https://t.co/nfaGDkRXOz The Land and Water Conservation Fund plays a vital role in protecting our beautiful natural resources that are critical to our economy and way of life in New Hampshire. @SenatorShaheen and I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to reauthorize this important program. Girls can do anything. Go Dejah and go Pats! https://t.co/Ke7l4yk56l Excited to serve as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth, where I‚Äôll keep working to get our country‚Äôs fiscal house in order and spur economic growth. The President‚Äôs steel and aluminum tariffs on close allies like Canada and the EU are undermining our global interests and hurting consumers and businesses. We introduced a bill to restore necessary Congressional oversight of these major economic decisions.https://t.co/6CC1TcW1mp Read more about the Disability Employment Incentive Act and how it will help break down barriers by incentivizing employers to hire and retain employees who experience disabilities and make their workplaces more accessible. https://t.co/j3VdVpYJpp People who experience disabilities still face far too many barriers in the workforce. I'm reintroducing legislation that will help support more inclusive workplaces. Listen to Donna tell her story about receiving a surprise medical bill for $1,648 in her own words: https://t.co/hHiFFRyyx1 I'm honored to bring Donna Beckman of Seabrook as my guest to the State of the Union. Donna, like too many Americans, received a surprise medical bill for care that she thought was in her insurance network. This practice must end and I thank Donna for sharing her story. People often receive massive surprise medical bills for things like a visit to the ER that they thought was in their insurance network. If this has happened to you, I want to hear your story. Write to my office about a surprise medical bill you received: https://t.co/o33Zy0CXGN Stories like Abby's and Emma's show why it is so critical that we ensure that students of all abilities are included and have the tools they need to learn. It's great to see this happening in our state.  https://t.co/pkqho8aUa5 Often law enforcement doesn't have the training they need to recognize subtle cries for help when it comes to child trafficking.

Today is the LAST day to make your voices heard about her proposal. Find out more about publicly commenting here: https://t.co/tNg5jNNAOz Fifty-six years ago, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act but women -- especially women of color -- still don‚Äôt receive equal pay for equal work. That's why I've cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to help hold businesses accountable when they discriminate on the basis of sex. Today I participated in my first @SenateFinance Committee hearing, which focused on skyrocketing drug prices. Holding down prescription drug prices is one of my top priorities - and I look forward to working with @ChuckGrassley and @RonWyden on this critical issue. I spoke with a Granite Stater who received a $3,500 surprise medical bill after going to an in-network ER (he was later told one of the doctors he saw was out-of-network). If you have an outrageous story like this, I want to hear it. You can share it here: https://t.co/o33Zy0CXGN Climate change is happening and it's impacting New Hampshire's Seacoast. I'm on the Senate floor because we need ac‚Ä¶ https://t.co/rlFzLPgbah Low-wage federal contractors provide vital services but they are not currently entitled to back pay after the senseless shutdown.

https://t.co/LDqfq4JH9n https://t.co/ndmLD637Cb The USS Thresher will finally be honored with a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery -- a fitting tribute to 129 brave men who were tragically lost in the deadliest submarine disaster in history. It will be a constant reminder of the crew's selfless sacrifice to our nation. According to reports, the Trump Administration will not set limits on PFOA and PFOS contaminates in drinking water. Communities across the country are looking to @EPAgov for guidance. If true, this is totally unacceptable. People often face massive bills for health care they thought was in their insurance network ‚Äì only to be told later that one of the doctors they saw was actually out-of-network. Read more about my legislation to help end these surprise medical bills here: https://t.co/BNke9kUjnp I've heard from people in New Hampshire about massive surprise medical bills they've received, often for care they thought was in-network. If you have a story about a surprise medical bill, I want to hear it. Submit yours here: https://t.co/o33Zy0CXGN According to a new nonpartisan report, as a result of the senseless government shutdown: 
   
 - The economy lost $11 billion ($3 billion that won't be recovered) 
 - An untold number of businesses lost revenue 
   
We cannot afford another shutdown. Proceeds from these coins will go toward carrying on Christa McAuliffe's work by supporting the @FIRSTweets program -- encouraging more young people to engage in STEM fields. Christa McAuliffe once said, "I touch the future. I teach." That couldn't be more true. Today, we introduced measures in the Senate and House to have coins minted in her honor to celebrate her spirit of exploration and dedication to inspiring young people everywhere. https://t.co/HFOC4nnJaJ Happy birthday to my dear friend @SenatorShaheen! Thank you for all you do for the people of New Hampshire ‚Äì it‚Äôs an honor to serve with you in the Senate. https://t.co/NyY6JhmyeJ If you want to nominate someone who represents our state‚Äôs values and all-hands-on-deck spirit to be a future ‚ÄúGranite Stater of the Month,‚Äù fill out the form here: https://t.co/l0MK75ln07 Last weekend, all of our ‚ÄúGranite Stater of the Month‚Äù recipients gathered in Manchester so we could celebrate their selfless work on behalf of the people of New Hampshire. It is my privilege each month to recognize extraordinary people who represent our state‚Äôs all-hands-on-deck spirit as our ‚ÄúGranite Staters of the Month‚Äù in the official Congressional Record. Their stories are truly remarkable ‚Äî watch a few of them here. https://t.co/bxpe6SnUUd I remain deeply concerned about William Barr‚Äôs broad view of executive power and his comments about Special Counsel Mueller's investigation ‚Äì and I oppose his nomination for Attorney General. Relieved @POTUS finally agreed to reopen the government while we keep negotiating on addressing border security. Americans have suffered because the President turned down this same deal in December. We can find a way forward but he must stop using people as political pawns. While working to end this shutdown, we are also calling on credit agencies to prevent late or missed payments that occur during this time from negatively impacting federal workers‚Äô credit ratings. https://t.co/IIKtodjvLA Pleased that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission heeded our call to delay the license review process for Seabrook Station so anyone potentially impacted can provide meaningful input. https://t.co/XPmD80gkxh I stood on the Senate floor today with a group of bipartisan Senators to send a clear message ‚Äî let‚Äôs pass a clean 3-week bill to reopen the government while we commit to passing strong, bipartisan border security during that time. It‚Äôs time for this shutdown to end. https://t.co/ZNReel3S7M This statement couldn‚Äôt be more out-of-touch. The Trump Administration seems to have no idea how this shutdown is harming people across the country. It is time for the President to end his games and reopen the government immediately. https://t.co/3dSOcvT3XC Rising sea levels and climate change continue to threaten New Hampshire's coastline, cutting property values on the Seacoast by $15 million according to a new report. For our economy, our environment, and our people, we must act now. https://t.co/4zIyWKVCvc We heard directly from the Manchester Transit Authority today about how the impacts of the President‚Äôs senseless shutdown are only going to get worse. It is essential that the President and Republican leadership come to the table to reopen the government. https://t.co/ehRtwb0cE5 The shutdown is having an impact on Americans of all walks of life ‚Äì people can't get support from federal agencies, communities are worried about food and housing assistance, and some businesses -- like NH's breweries -- can't move forward with new projects. This must end. It is now day 33 of the President's senseless shutdown and TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and thousands of other federal workers are about to go without their second paycheck. President Trump and Republican leadership need to reopen the government now. It's been 46 years since Roe v. Wade enshrined a woman's constitutional right to make her own reproductive health choices -- but the attacks on this right have not stopped. We can't and won't stop fighting back. It's day 32 of the President's politically motivated shutdown and TSA officers are still hard at work ‚Äì without pay ‚Äì keeping the public safe. I went to Manchester airport today to hear from them. The first priority must be reopening the government immediately. https://t.co/vsJfCXQJjA In the United States, you should be free to serve your country without discrimination because of your gender identity. President Trump's transgender service ban was reprehensible when it was proposed and it remains reprehensible now. https://t.co/H4CUK6DmcH Honored to join in celebrations of Dr. King's life and legacy in New Hampshire. At a moment where our country is once again facing challenges in our march toward greater inclusion, I'm proud to stand with Granite Staters in fighting for an America that values all people. https://t.co/8PHzOuMqrc Today as we honor the life and legacy of Dr. King Jr., let‚Äôs stand up for our values that he so valiantly fought for and continue his work of ensuring that our country lives up to its commitment to the freedom, equality, and dignity of all of our people. https://t.co/bNvSNOfyHE .@Patriots never give up. #EverythingWeGot üêê In NH, we are known for the all-hands-on-deck spirit of our people, where people pitch in and do extraordinary work to support their communities. I've been honored to recognize a few of them as Granite Staters of the Month, and tonight I thanked them in person for all they do. https://t.co/UiYEzobKQK I also met with officials from Keene who are concerned about critical grants being delayed that would impact their community members and ongoing projects. As this shutdown continues, it will keep hurting more and more hard-working people across our country. https://t.co/Uw1gUD75v4 I also met with Mayor Lovett of Claremont to hear about the concerns she has for her community as the government shutdown continues. She‚Äôs worried about food insecurity for local residents and students, and the impact of the shutdown on affordable housing and rental assistance. https://t.co/01e5bOXQtM This morning, we broke ground on a new affordable housing project in Claremont that'll help expand economic opportunity in the area and support businesses. Unfortunately, the shutdown is having severe consequences on affordable housing projects in the state and across the country https://t.co/3M0WBR6dRd Today, I'm in western New Hampshire hearing about the impacts President Trump‚Äôs senseless government shutdown is having on communities. It is now day 27 of the President's senseless government shutdown. Granite Staters like Dara ‚Äì and people across our country ‚Äì are bearing the brunt of the President's political games. Enough -- @senatemajldr must let us vote and President Trump must reopen the government. https://t.co/RRdFVQU06c Rather than allowing a vote to reopen the government, Leader McConnell just had the Senate vote on an anti-choice bill. Rather than helping the thousands of Americans impacted by this senseless shutdown, Republicans are focusing, again, on attacking women's reproductive rights. This is horrifying news. The Trump Administration's policy of separating children from their families was outrageous and cruel, and now we are learning that it was even more widespread than previously reported. There must be accountability. https://t.co/cz47ttcZGB This is beyond appalling. They must be held accountable. https://t.co/7wVT6D7v2h .@SenatorShaheen and I have reintroduced our bill that would overturn the recent Supreme Court ruling that would put New Hampshire's small businesses at risk of mountains of red tape by forcing them to collect internet sales tax for other states. https://t.co/k2MTzlef3t We should not make a former coal lobbyist with a record of putting big oil and corporate special interests ahead of our environment, economy, and the health of our people the permanent head of the EPA. https://t.co/Md656rFoCX While I'm pleased that the President has signed our bill into law that will ensure that federal workers receive back pay, he needs to actually open the government and end this senseless shutdown. https://t.co/TAC8Zid979 The picture I'm holding is of Roger, a furloughed worker in New Hampshire who fell ill over the holidays and is worried about how his family will afford their bills. I stood on the Senate steps today to again call on the President and Majority Leader to end this shutdown. https://t.co/DyOtkYF6YL Survivors of sexual and domestic violence will feel the impacts of the President‚Äôs senseless shutdown if funding is not quickly restored. It‚Äôs long past time for the President‚Äôs games to stop and for his shutdown to end. https://t.co/LioVqndirm Today, I am joining my colleagues in reintroducing a resolution that would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to defend Americans' health care against the lawsuit from Republican Attorneys General that would raise costs and take coverage away from millions of Americans. https://t.co/Eb5K5AYoEa A new report finds that Americans are now more likely to die of an accidental overdose than a car crash. The urgency of addressing the opioid crisis cannot be overstated. https://t.co/BaTywJPYt4 If you are a Granite Stater and have a story about how the shutdown has impacted you, I want to hear it. Email it to my office at stories@hassan.senate.gov. Took calls today from Granite Staters who are concerned about the continuing shutdown. I want to thank everyone who has been making their voices heard, it's time the President stops playing games and ends this shutdown. https://t.co/LZI11wektE I'm live on the Senate floor telling the stories of Granite States impacted by the President‚Äôs shutdown: https://t.co/pjduR5gCAq I'll be telling more stories like theirs tonight on the Senate floor. It's time for the President‚Äôs games to stop, and for our government to reopen. On Christmas Eve, Dara's mother passed away and she is facing the expenses of a funeral without a paycheck. https://t.co/P55bgE130i Lanna has young children and she's worried about going into debt over child care. https://t.co/vKcQWfrCzV Earlier this week, I received letters from some of New Hampshire's hard-working air traffic controllers. I wanted to share a bit of their letters here: Congratulations to @UofNH for being recognized as one of our country‚Äôs top-tier research universities! https://t.co/5TQghmEDPs Thank you, Carter, for helping make sure everyone is included. https://t.co/woxQTJ7lL1 Proud to serve with so many extraordinary women at a time when the face of Congress is changing. https://t.co/geKNERBooA Reproductive health choices should be between a woman and her doctor ‚Äì not her employer. We can‚Äôt stop fighting back against the Trump Administration‚Äôs attacks on women‚Äôs reproductive health. https://t.co/jkV69okAnl The beautiful home, studio, and gardens of Augustus Saint-Gaudens play an important role in the local economy and deserve the recognition that comes with the title of a National Historic Park. This week I joined the NH delegation in introducing a bill to designate it as one. Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are one of the top challenges I hear about from people across New Hampshire, and I reintroduced legislation to help lower costs. You can read about the bills here. https://t.co/FJV7AE4OZW I visited the Nashua Soup Kitchen to discuss the impacts of the President‚Äôs shutdown. The longer this shutdown goes on the more uncertainty organizations like New Hampshire‚Äòs food kitchens face. It must end now. https://t.co/C3OEOC3U2j I've heard from Granite Staters who are describing their fears of not being able to afford gas, rent, or food. They are not ‚Äúbetter off.‚Äù https://t.co/xwFtEmj61b It's official -- the President's government shutdown is now the longest in history. And each day, the hardships on Granite Staters impacted by the shutdown grow. It's time for these games to end and for Republicans and President Trump to end this shutdown. Visited with @StraffordCAP in Dover this afternoon to hear about how the harmful government shutdown will impact their mission of providing food, education, and child care services to Granite Staters in the area. https://t.co/WAo1rbHgrB Today, I sat down with community orgs and staff at the Nashua Soup Kitchen to hear their concerns about the impacts of the senseless government shutdown on their work and the people they serve. As it drags on, we know the impacts will only grow more severe. This cannot continue. https://t.co/5eXl3EjSvE This shouldn‚Äôt be necessary but I‚Äôm proud to see New Hampshire businesses stepping up and supporting their neighbors impacted by the shutdown. https://t.co/ahx27Ip3mi The House voted yesterday to challenge the awful ruling that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. This decision would raise health care costs and take away coverage from millions of Americans if it‚Äôs not overturned, we can't stop fighting.
 https://t.co/NpMAbKBrdt Pharmaceutical companies are allowed to write-off billions in advertising costs at taxpayers‚Äô expense, while at the same time padding their pockets by increasing drug prices. I'm cosponsoring @SenatorShaheen's bill to end their advertising tax break. https://t.co/sWFh6Cypvp The President‚Äôs senseless government shutdown is hurting hard-working Granite Staters, and if you‚Äôre one of them, I want to hear from you. We need to make clear to Republicans in Congress and President Trump what‚Äôs at stake. Email me your story at stories@hassan.senate.gov. https://t.co/jGDjdMG4dF The President's shutdown is increasingly putting the health and safety of Americans at risk. It is time for this senseless shutdown to end. https://t.co/kqNlz63SNU Happy to announce that this week, the President signed a bill I cosponsored to help support children who have been the survivors of abuse and to bring perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice. https://t.co/2WoJCrjOJz The House again voted to reopen critical parts of our government, helping relieve the toll on workers going without pay and Americans who are going without critical services. It's time the Senate did the same, it's time that Leader McConnell let us vote to reopen the government. Thank you to all of our dedicated law enforcement officers in New Hampshire and around the country who work every day to serve our communities and keep our people safe. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/Stf0fTuZ54 EPA employees can‚Äôt come to work because of his shutdown, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped President Trump from attacking our environment by nominating a former coal lobbyist to head the agency meant to protect our natural resources. https://t.co/hnuLzsL5hi Great to meet with @DrLeanaWen, the new president of Planned Parenthood. I'm proud to stand with advocates like her in the fight to protect women's reproductive rights and access to health care. https://t.co/1qRmtmMeGJ We must end the President‚Äôs senseless and harmful shutdown. It‚Äôs time for Leader McConnell to call for a vote on the bipartisan bills that the House passed and that Republican Senators support to reopen the government. https://t.co/8Zn5nPvU1C Granite Staters and Americans are feeling the impacts of the President‚Äôs senseless government shutdown and I'm on t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Xjj7MQR80u When patients have a medical emergency, the last thing they should have to worry about is if they will face a ridiculously high surprise medical bill. It's unacceptable, and I won't stop fighting to addresses these practices. https://t.co/cRX8ltrROl 97% of Americans support expanding federal background checks to all gun sales. It's commonsense and it's long past time for Congress to act -- that's why I'm helping reintroduce the Background Check Expansion Act to do just that. https://t.co/pI3KAGPt4J We must close the urban-rural digital divide across New Hampshire and the country. The FCC‚Äôs flawed broadband maps could prevent communities in New Hampshire from getting a fair share of federal funding to expand rural broadband. These maps must be fixed. https://t.co/k9B6CM7hfs Hard-working Americans are suffering because of the President‚Äôs political games. He needs to reopen the government and we must support the federal workers impacted by this senseless shutdown. We're introducing a bipartisan bill to ensure federal workers impacted receive backpay. This exciting new initiative at @UofNH will provide students who experience intellectual and developmental disabilities an opportunity to receive an inclusive college experience and learn in an environment of their peers. #unh4u https://t.co/0la79gVG1J Great news! Our bipartisan Hack DHS Act has just been signed into law by the President. https://t.co/0yBjEBylKL The House passed 2 bipartisan bills, which nearly all Senate Republicans have already supported, that would re-open the government immediately. It‚Äôs time for @senatemajldr to bring these bills to the floor and for @realDonaldTrump to finally put an end to this senseless shutdown. We need to hold federal agencies accountable and ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted. The President just signed into law a bill that I cosponsored to help maintain fiscal responsibility and improve efficiency in government. https://t.co/bDi4Cb8tTo The VA‚Äôs blunder should not negatively impact the finances of veterans seeking higher education and this new law will help address the VA‚Äôs unacceptable failure. https://t.co/DlkHmu4Ajy Congratulations to Captain Daniel Ettlich, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard‚Äôs next commander https://t.co/NKqVlbojDW I look forward to working with @ONDCP Director Jim Carroll to continue strengthening our efforts to combat the opioid crisis.

Annie has a proven record of fighting on behalf of all Granite Staters and Americans and I am eager to continue working with her to advance the priorities of the people of NH. Congrats to my new First District Congressman @RepPappasNH on being sworn in as a member of the #116thCongress! I look forward to continuing to work with Chris as he hits the ground running and keeps fighting for hard-working people across our state and country. Welcome, @SenatorSinema and @SenJackyRosen-- I'm excited to work with both of you! Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other types of dementia are a massive and under-recognized public health challenge.

As the year comes to a close, I wanted to take the time to share some of their incredible stories. https://t.co/UGvoo450xn From our family to yours, wishing everyone a very merry Christmas! https://t.co/Rr2FOZNQWB A day after Secretary Mattis resigned in protest, the US point person in the fight against ISIS resigned in response to the President‚Äôs Syria decision that he felt will threaten our national security. The threat posed by ISIS persists and it must be taken seriously. https://t.co/pvgAs1mZsb The President said he‚Äôd be ‚Äúproud‚Äù to shut down the government and unfortunately here we are. On Wednesday all 100 senators supported a clean funding extension - a deal the President said he‚Äôd accept. I urge the President to come to the table now and end this shutdown. Students trying to get a higher education should not have to face the burdensome, complex web of red-tape that comes with applying for federal financial aid, and I‚Äôm pleased the Senate passed our bill this week to help simplify the process. https://t.co/VXNVe0ckIf This week the President signed into law legislation that will help keep Americans safe by making it easier for intelligence analysts to identify terrorist threats ‚Äì I thank @HurdOnTheHill for working across the aisle with me to push this bill across the finish line. Members of both parties must step up now to do everything we can to promote a coherent American foreign policy that will keep us safe, secure, and free. I‚Äôm deeply grateful for Secretary Mattis‚Äôs years of service. His resignation letter powerfully raises concerns from members of both parties about the President‚Äôs haphazard, impulsive approach to foreign policy. https://t.co/ED0x8yC5D3 This critical bill to ensure that our veterans get the benefits they have earned has just passed the House. I urge the President to sign it without delay. https://t.co/tX5zeUKR4p Good news for New Hampshire ‚Äì the farm bill was just signed into law. This bipartisan bill will do everything from supporting our dairy farmers, to reauthorizing the Northern Border Regional Commission and expanding broadband access. Gender discrimination and other challenges both big and small still exist for women serving in public office and in all types of jobs. We‚Äôve come a long way but we can‚Äôt stop fighting to break down barriers for women to pursue their dreams. https://t.co/ZdCN2ySxAs You can read more about our bipartisan efforts to bolster the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs cyber defenses here: https://t.co/VnoSD4kIqM I also want to thank Representatives @GOPLeader, @RepMcCaul, and @BennieGThompson, as well as Senators @SenRonJohnson and @clairecmc for their help in getting this bill passed, and I look forward to the President signing this important measure without delay. .@senrobportman and I have been working together on legislation to help strengthen our nation's cyber defenses, and I'm happy to say that two of our bills, including the Hack DHS Act, are heading to the President's desk for signature. Wishing you a Merry Christmas from the Senate floor üéÑ https://t.co/SwRVI5BcJZ For years, small towns were inundated with millions more opioid pills than there were people, yet drug distribution companies turned a blind eye while reaping the profits. This is unacceptable and I will keep working to hold big pharma accountable. https://t.co/1HNsBFBI7i When wildfires raged in California, a New Hampshire family business stepped up to help. For their efforts, I'm proud to recognize the families behind Schilling Beer Co., as well as Head Brewer Chris Deapo, as the December Granite Staters of the Month. https://t.co/UgP8321ccg It is unacceptable that veterans are suffering because of the inadequacies of the VA. I was proud to work across the aisle to help ensure that our brave veterans receive their full GI student housing benefits. https://t.co/xC6mkvb8AP Congratulations to @NHNationalGuard Adjutant General David Mikolaities on his promotion to Major General! This is utterly shameful. Our veterans deserve so much better than this. https://t.co/SWFFzW9e0j I‚Äôm grateful for the leadership of @ChuckGrassley and @SenatorDurbin who have worked across party lines for years to build support for these commonsense reforms that will help make our criminal justice system more fair and reduce the likelihood that individuals will reoffend. Bipartisan criminal justice reform will help make the system fairer and more effectively reduce crime, which is why this commonsense bill is supported by everyone from 87 Senators, to President Trump, the ACLU, criminal prosecutors, and law enforcement officers. Thank you for your work reporting on this important issue. It‚Äôs completely unacceptable that patients are getting massive surprise bills even for care they thought was in their insurance network. https://t.co/DvjbJ9HQ5Q This is good news, but it is just one small step toward stopping mass shootings. We must do far more to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/9F6ezdKmDA Happy #NationalMapleSyrupDay -- hope you're all having the best maple syrup in the country to celebrate (from New Hampshire, of course)! Here's a throwback to my visit to Meadow View Sugar House last March during the start of sugaring season. https://t.co/3xUgKZHpXh Wow, what a truly incredible story. I'm so proud to call Kriss a friend, she clearly brings that Granite State spirit of stepping up and helping those in need wherever she goes. https://t.co/urDNjYDMpc Today in New Hampshire, and across the country, we honor those who served by laying wreaths on their resting places. We must never forget the sacrifices of our servicemen and women, nor those of their loved ones. https://t.co/SAwoEHAg43 The Texas court decision striking down the Affordable Care Act would raise health care costs and take away coverage from millions of Americans if it‚Äôs not overturned. We‚Äôre going to fight this awful decision with everything we have. https://t.co/mZqj0aDDXk Ryan Zinke had no regard for our environment and public lands. He was also corrupt, consistently abusing taxpayer dollars for his own benefit. I'm glad he will finally resign. https://t.co/X5YFKpPYe6 Last night‚Äôs ruling on the Affordable Care Act is being appealed, you can still get covered while we fight these attacks on Americans‚Äô health care. But it is the LAST DAY to sign up for health insurance on https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz. Visit now and spread the word! This decision will endanger the health care of millions of Americans. This cannot stand. https://t.co/qc52AKIwTU Tomorrow is the LAST DAY to explore your health insurance options on https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz. Don't miss out on your chance to take advantage of open enrollment. Get covered and visit https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz today. Joined the wonderful staff of @_MealsOnWheels today to deliver lunch to some of our seniors. Thank you for letting me come along and for all that you do to support your fellow Granite Staters. https://t.co/mz86QwJTtz Fire fighters put their lives on the line every day to protect their fellow Granite Staters, and many have been exposed to PFAS contaminates through their work. We're calling on the CDC to ensure that the health impacts of these contaminants on fire fighters are understood. https://t.co/4BwFy8bROZ The Trump Administration is letting big oil lobbyists rewrite our nation's emission standards. Reversing action on climate change like this will only continue to endanger the health of our people and environment. https://t.co/djy6unJhCe Six years ago, 26 innocent lives were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since then, we have witnessed too many more senseless massive gun violence crimes. It‚Äôs not enough to say we remember the victims ‚Äì we must act to prevent future tragedies. You have until Saturday to explore your health insurance options on https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz. Don't miss out on open enrollment, visit https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz now! I joined @BloombergTV earlier to discuss the importance of protecting New Hampshire small businesses from the Supreme Court‚Äôs backward decision forcing businesses to collect internet sales tax for other states. https://t.co/scytiYkj8G I‚Äôm proud that the Senate sent a clear message to Saudi Arabia today that its behavior cannot continue. A very happy 382nd birthday to the @USNationalGuard! Thank you to all who serve and work to keep our nation safe, secure, and free. People who engage in sexual harassment in the workplace must be held accountable, including in Congress. I‚Äôm glad Congress passed this bipartisan agreement that will strengthen protections for survivors and consequences for perpetrators. https://t.co/AwZa1UeIkM I want to thank @HurdOnTheHill for his work to get the DHS Data Framework Act passed in the House. I introduced the Senate version of this bill to streamline the process to identify terrorist threats and I look forward to @POTUS signing it into law without delay. Time is running out! Saturday is the deadline to enroll in health insurance coverage on https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz. Visit today. https://t.co/kXYWdzu3Ao The bipartisan farm bill has now passed the House and is headed to the President for his signature. This bill supports New Hampshire's farmers and rural communities, and I urge the President to sign it as soon as possible. Doctors and lawyers have a legal obligation to act responsibly with our personal information -- tech companies should be required to do the same. We're working to ensure that online service providers act in the best interest of their customers. https://t.co/tgaEGaieBO Jim Fadden was a Granite State icon who brought joy to countless people with his remarkable dedication to his community, and of course, his famous maple syrup. Tom and my thoughts are with his family and friends and all those across our state who will dearly miss him. https://t.co/6mDAjzit2y Good news! Members of both parties just voted to overturn the Trump Administration's rule that would allow secret dark money donors to further hide their identities. The House must join us and vote to hold corporate special interests accountable. Today, we are forcing a vote to overturn the Trump Administration's rule that makes the campaign finance system even worse by helping dark money donors further hide their identities. We need more transparency, not less. https://t.co/2zHWI177XU Four days left to explore your health care options on https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz. Visit today before the December 15 deadline. https://t.co/UcE0IEbRSb I am also pleased that the bipartisan farm bill includes a provision I supported to reauthorize the Northern Border Regional Commission for five years and to expand the reach of the program to Cheshire and Belknap counties. Today the Senate passed a bipartisan farm bill that will provide critical support to New Hampshire's agriculture industry as well as other priorities like investing in rural communities by expanding broadband, strengthening water infrastructure, and expanding telehealth. Today I spoke on the Senate floor to pay tribute to @SenatorHeitkamp ‚Äì a friend, colleague, and a trailblazer. https://t.co/9ygSJWRTUC The United States was the fourth deadliest country for journalists this year. 

This Person of the Year selection is a powerful reminder from @TIME that it is more important than ever that we defend the free press and journalists' work, at home and abroad. https://t.co/AS6eA3qyuN This is a massive step backward for ensuring Americans have clean water. This Administration continues to put profits of big corporations over the health and well-being of our people and our environment. #DirtyWaterRule https://t.co/VmV8BpN4Vk Forty-four former members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, are speaking out in defense of democracy. Thank you. We must uphold the Constitution and defend our democratic institutions. https://t.co/JWuA8aOp5V While President Obama‚Äôs jump shot video was pretty great, the point still stands. Go to https://t.co/3OYnbxcDyz today and explore your health insurance options. https://t.co/iSsqo1pCB8 Adverse childhood experiences affect individuals for their entire lives. I joined @Spark_NH to discuss new data that reaffirms the need to keep working together to ensure that children are supported. https://t.co/gQOst2qfpl
