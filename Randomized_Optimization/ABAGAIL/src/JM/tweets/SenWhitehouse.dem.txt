It seems to me, after twelve years of experience, that the worst days in our Senate Democratic Caucus are usually better than the best days in the Senate Republican Caucus. https://t.co/WBvO5mvFnb Translation: ‚ÄúPardon me, please, Mr. President!‚Äù https://t.co/N1ripkOIKt I‚Äôve made this point before generally, but @thinkprogress applies it to specific vote - interesting. 

Basically, the majority of Americans were overruled in yesterday‚Äôs #shutdown votes.

@realDonaldTrump interests and allies conspired deliberately with foreign interests to sabotage an American presidential campaign through the knowing use of illegally stolen information. 

The walls are closing in. #RogerStoneIndictment 
https://t.co/38aWkxUaUF It‚Äôs a lengthy indictment, but it‚Äôs worth reading if only for its window into a world of sleaze. #RogerStoneIndictment 

https://t.co/I8OE3zq95m RT @foe_us: We need real, substantive climate action to combat fast-warming oceans.

"It‚Äôs one thing to throw up a sun shade beside a pool;‚Ä¶ Their political silence in Congress on climate is DEAFENING ‚Äî and trust me, #Republicans notice that all corporate America is AWOL on climate in Congress. https://t.co/bAQ8wjGPYz Worse, @Google, @facebook, and @Microsoft do nothing serious in Congress on #climate legislation. Nada. 

They have their own lobbying priorities, and those come first for them. https://t.co/ThZpS9TZJY RT @David_Arkush: .@ceidotorg is mad that @chucktodd made a great call &amp; barred climate deniers from @MeetThePress. Great time for other Su‚Ä¶ Corporate America hugely anti-climate in Congress. Even the good guys. 
https://t.co/40B96OjYvh One place for these corporations to start would be making it a priority where it counts ‚Äî in Congress. 

The good guys are useless in Congress; the bad guys are remorseless. The effect is #climate inaction. https://t.co/76783ip82Y With the government open, we can consider responsible ways to boost border security. It‚Äôs time to end this nonsense now. #EndTheShutdown 
https://t.co/4h0cQPlNAc Still, I‚Äôm encouraged that some @SenateGOP are beginning to join Democrats to back a sensible resolution to this mess. They understand that the number one priority is ending this hostage crisis. #EndTheShutdown That is bitterly disappointing and frustrating, especially in light of the #RhodeIslanders who tell me they can‚Äôt make ends meet during the #Trumpshutdown. #EndTheShutdown 
https://t.co/VyoAbJti0P Now, at @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr McConnell‚Äôs bidding, they‚Äôve reversed themselves and voted to continue holding hostage hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and all the Americans who depend on their work. Before @realDonaldTrump caved to right-wing extremists, broke the bipartisan deal, and triggered this shutdown, most of my @SenateGOP colleagues had voted in favor of the proposal we considered today. .@SenateGOP just filibustered itself to maintain the #TrumpShutdown. They are the Majority. 

They could have let this pass w 52 votes (52-44) &amp; the shutdown could have ended. The bill had been passed by the House &amp; was ready to go, subject to Trump veto. https://t.co/H6ZsTXOlpN Pretty funny, Mitch. 

Political spite? Showboating? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the #TrumpShutdown, and it‚Äôs emanating from the Oval Office. 

As for a deal? We had one, bipartisan; the Senate passed it, and @realDonaldTrump broke it. 

#EndTheShutdown, @senatemajldr. You can do it. https://t.co/fvlLgzKGbd ‚Ä¶comes from this report, by a group which has done similar analyses up and down the Atlantic Coast‚Ä¶ https://t.co/HcVJ1lgDiK If on the other hand you were just a front for big fossil-fuel donors, you‚Äôd do what the @realDonaldTrump administration is doing.

https://t.co/oPjmXPJfYY Actually, if you really wanted to weaken Russia ‚Äî ‚Äúa gas station with an army,‚Äù as McCain used to say ‚Äî you‚Äôd move to renewables as fast as you could, and you‚Äôd support renewables growth in countries vulnerable to Putin‚Äôs petro-politics. https://t.co/dnjugSwDD3 The question is, are these Senators getting hall passes from ‚Å¶@senatemajldr‚Å©, few enough to make sure our bill to end shutdown doesn‚Äôt pass, or is this a real move to get something done? Hope it is the latter. But Mitch is expert at the hall pass charade.https://t.co/WkPBkJY1Qt Congratulations to our two new chairmen (how good does that sound?): Chairman @JimLangevin on @HASCDemocrats subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats &amp; Capabilities; and Chairman @davidcicilline on @HouseJudiciary subcommittee on Antitrust Law. They will be great! https://t.co/WGMUlpolJ3 Too bad they don‚Äôt ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù fossil fuel interests in Congress.  

Most don‚Äôt even ‚Äúperform‚Äù at all ‚Äî net zero (or worse) corporate support in Congress for #climate legislation. https://t.co/Ro1lsGDyTL RT @GlennThrush: The shutdown is causing real pain, anxiety and hardship for the most vulnerable Americans -- the homeless, those teetering‚Ä¶ Using the pressure of fear for a witness‚Äôs family‚Äôs safety and well-being to impede the witness‚Äôs testimony to a committee of Congress? 

Isn‚Äôt there a name for that?  https://t.co/woYr7AphXj It gets better: @realDonaldTrump called her refusal ‚Äúa great blotch on the great country we all love.‚Äù 

This from the Great Blotch himself.

Makes me wonder if ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù like @Google, @Facebook, @Ford, @VW, @PepsiCo, and @Microsoft, are still funding them. 

I stand with @chucktodd. Do they? 

Science denial is fraud. Don‚Äôt fund it. https://t.co/2Eq2fmojwy Could this be an end to the shutdown?! 

@realDonaldTrump vote loses; Senate substitute passes, reopening with all back pay and next paycheck;  

House passes it quickly; and we have til February 8th to address the pending appropriations bills. Allowing @realDonaldTrump's #TransBan to go forward is a blow to the LGBTQ+ community and our armed forces alike.
