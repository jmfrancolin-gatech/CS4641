John‚Äôs wise words stuck with me, and I‚Äôve passed his advice along as I mentor new Members here in the House. His wit and wisdom will be missed. I‚Äôll never forget what John said: You have an important job, but you‚Äôre not an important person. The minute you think you are is the minute you cut corners. When I first came to Congress, John Dingell was one of the first people I sought out for advice. Tawni and I are saddened to hear about the passing of former Rep. John Dingell.
John challenged all of us to come together to make life better for all Americans. His positive attitude will be missed.
Our prayers go to Debbie, the Dingell family and our Michigan neighbors tonight. Great to be on Central Time talking about the issues facing Wisconsinites in rural communities! Listen to the interview here: https://t.co/cCpqusecdH https://t.co/4qHO2X2Ys8 Proud to lead a bipartisan, bicameral team in introducing the Trade Security Act of 2019. It is long-past time for Congress to reassert its constitutionally-granted power in our Nation‚Äôs #trade policy and protect our export power. Read more here: https://t.co/lZiezr0V0s We have a problem when it comes to retirement savings. I am proud to introduce the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which l will help Wisconsinites grow savings accounts and help us avoid a retirement savings shortfall in the future. #RESA https://t.co/lwYkmdV7BD 3/3 I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to find common ground, and will fight to break down the hyper-partisanship in Congress to make life better for Wisconsinites. There is far more that brings us together than divides us. 2/3 We don‚Äôt need a Republican or Democratic agenda ‚Äì we need an American agenda. I was encouraged to hear bipartisan proposals in tonight‚Äôs #SOTU, including a commitment to lowering drug prices, rebuilding our failing infrastructure, and investing in cancer research. 1/3 We can all agree: America needs unity. Wisconsinites like Ramon are the heart of our rural communities. It is an honor to invite him as a tribute to our first responders and volunteers who work tirelessly to lift our communities higher and move us forward. I look forward to Ramon Knudtson joining me for the #SOTU. Ramon has dedicated his life to making Wisconsin stronger through his work with the Village of Melrose, the Wisconsin Rural Water Association, and the Melrose Fire Department. Great to join Scott and Elizabeth at the @LaCrosseTribune for Tribcast, the Tribune's podcast. We talked about the State of the Union, what Washington is up to this week, and the path forward in the 116th Congress. Check it out here üëá https://t.co/SuNC8e74aF Check out this feel-good story from La Crosse. Thanks to all of the teachers, support staff and administrators who work every day to ensure our kids learn the important things: "be respectful, responsible and safe." https://t.co/UNzzOV8eiR Proud to introduce the bipartisan, Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act. Congress needs to stand up and fight for our rural economies by taking back the trade authorities that, according to our Constitution, clearly belong to the Legislative branch. https://t.co/0RVB1Xzlkz Foxconn has a bad track record of breaking promises, and now it's clear that Wisconsin's taxpayers are the ones getting fleeced. 
If the late, great Senator Bill Proxmire were still alive, the Foxconn project would take home his Golden Fleece Award. https://t.co/fCgQSWqnil Who woulda guessed? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†https://t.co/6PCzr9AYsR Stay safe out there today, Wisconsinites. At least it's a dry heat, right? https://t.co/x6kpFI1KV4 The fight to protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions is always personal, because it touches so many of our lives.

Stay warm, and stay safe out there this week! https://t.co/wgyPzovR2f This shutdown cost us $3 Billion, and we'll never get it back. Shutdowns have consequences long after they end, and should NEVER be a negotiating tactic. https://t.co/0XHMRyvx22 2/2 Now it‚Äôs time to get in the same room and work together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions that effectively fix our broken immigration system. 1/2 Reopening the government is the right first step to moving forward from this embarrassing shutdown - but this short-term compromise bill cannot lead to another shutdown.  The federal government and its workers should never be used by anyone as hostages for a policy goal. Wisconsin farmers, workers and families can't afford more tariffs, and are suffering the consequences of this trade war. This bill - and the administration's bad trade policy - will hurt our rural economy and America's heartland. https://t.co/mNxSvKVjNo Wilbur Ross, who spent a decade reporting a nearly $3 BILLION net worth, doesn't understand why Wisconsin's federal workers &amp; contractors, farmers, and families can't afford this shutdown. Talk about out of touch. https://t.co/FNPglrrxzE In Case You Missed It: Yesterday, I unveiled my plan to reopen the federal government. Check it out here: https://t.co/fUA6YxH6EU It‚Äôs time we create a pathway to citizenship that funds border modernization and stops the inflow of drugs into our country, while promoting the legal immigration that Wisconsin‚Äôs farmers, businesses and communities need. Read more here: https://t.co/4EHSSV1qrK There is no question that our immigration system is broken and badly in need of repair. Instead of refusing to work together, I‚Äôm proposing a compromise: commonsense solutions to the problems that we face, and at no cost to Wisconsinites. https://t.co/qyg9fLzshX Wisconsin's breweries contribute to our local economy and our state's culture. This shutdown is threatening the ability to sell our beer across state lines, and is hurting our businesses.   https://t.co/vsakyF3CYS The shutdown is hurting Wisconsin farmers, businesses and families. Both sides need to get in the same room and have a meaningful discussion about how to move forward. Let‚Äôs reopen the government and get serious about 21st-century border security. "It‚Äôs just one more punch in the gut farmers have to overcome.‚Äù 
The shutdown and the consequences of this trade war are hitting Wisconsin's rural economy especially hard. Enough is enough. https://t.co/yz52S4Q0WX ATTN.

The nonstop partisan attacks on the health and wellbeing of our families need to stop. #ProtectOurCare (2/3) The lawsuit threatens to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and it‚Äôs protections over 2.4 million Wisconsinites living with pre-existing conditions. (1/3) Yesterday, I voted to protect Wisconsinites‚Äô healthcare by helping pass a resolution that strengthens Congress‚Äôs hand to intervene in Texas v. U.S., an appalling lawsuit previously led by Brad Schimel and Scott Walker. Today is #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay. Thank you to the men &amp; women who put their lives on the line to protect us. As the brother of a police officer, I know firsthand the hard work &amp; dedication our Law Enforcement shows to our communities every day.  Thank you! Congratulations, Gwen!

It‚Äôs time to move Wisconsin - and America - forward. https://t.co/TyIwAiFRQk Meanwhile in Wisconsin, a family farmer got his bailout check...it was $2.00. This is no way to treat America's farmers. https://t.co/mgsg42vAgi Wisconsin has lost $139 million to import tariffs since this Administration got its hands on trade and started this unnecessary trade war. In what world would this be a good idea? https://t.co/pgd9w0ctxh I am proud to cosponsor the For the People Act, a bill that puts the power back where it belongs: in the hands of Wisconsinites. #HR1 https://t.co/VGSWst6obM The longer we let this shutdown continue, the more it jeopardizes our national security and the economic growth that we need right now in this country. https://t.co/c6DfKb5I7L A trade war, low commodity prices, major farm consolidation - and now a government shutdown. Wisconsin's family farmers shouldn't be used as pawns, and can't afford the chaos caused by this shutdown. This needs to end. https://t.co/BNECXXKzch Today, we enter a new chapter in our representative democracy.

As long as family farmers are fighting for their lives in Wisconsin, I will continue to fight for them in this Farm Bill. #farmbill2018 (2/3) and in Chicago and San Francisco. It cuts $800 million from vital conservation programs, and does nothing to address the damage caused by the President‚Äôs trade war.

Today, I toured the La Crosse City Brewery, and discussed the impact of the President‚Äôs aluminum tariffs on industries and products Wisconsin is proud of, like beer. https://t.co/hsO7aFvnUq The Mississippi River shapes our environment, culture and our local economy. We need to take proactive steps to protect the river for generations to come. https://t.co/JK7ezGd046 Be sure to follow along on Instagram!  I'll keep you updated on what I'm working on, and share some great photos of the most beautiful place on earth - western and central Wisconsin! #WIproud https://t.co/YALrkRaRtq It was great to welcome Hannah Butts, winner of our district's Congressional Art Competition, to the Capitol this week. It always makes me proud to see art from Wisconsin‚Äôs talented students showcased here in our Nation‚Äôs Capitol. #WIproud https://t.co/6nuwVNEqci The irony of President Trump coming to Wisconsin to praise Foxconn - a Taiwanese company that has required billions of Wisconsin taxpayer incentives - while threatening to tax Wisconsin‚Äôs own Harley Davidson out of existence, is not lost on Wisconsinites. https://t.co/z7Kuo8V2DL It's going to be a hot weekend across western and central Wisconsin. Be sure to stay cool and drink plenty of water! üåû https://t.co/8NyL6KB1DC 30 states still lack discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans, proving that the fight for equality is far from over. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, which will help move Wisconsin and America forward. #EqualityForward Now more than ever, America needs to give respect and decency a shot. This week, try having a beer with a neighbor you don't usually agree with. It may not be the easy way, but it‚Äôs the Wisconsin way. Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I‚Äôm urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act. The Farm Bill that passed today lavishes millions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies on big agribusinesses &amp; cuts vital conservation programs at the expense of family farmers. We need a Farm Bill that will work for our family farmers in WI ‚Äì not for powerful special interests in DC No question that our immigration system is broken &amp; in need of repair, but separating families is wrong. It has never been the policy of our Nation to use children as political pawns. I am proud to support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop this practice &amp; reunite families. The keystone of our democracy is holding the power to choose our representatives - not the other way around. The U.S. Supreme Court's delayed decision on fair voting maps is disappointing, but not the end of the fight. https://t.co/CGPB5J8GMH "Instead of a go-it-alone approach, the United States should work with our allies to create a comprehensive strategy to bring China to the table to address these issues, and protect Wisconsin jobs."

I am honored to present this flag to his family in Bob's memory &amp; hope that it serves as a reminder of Bob's dedication to WI &amp; our great country.

Happy Birthday @USArmy, and thank you to all of our Servicemembers and Veterans who have served.  #ArmyBDay https://t.co/zbkmhRlZhr ICYMI: "Their policy and their strategy shifts from minute to minute and it creates a lot of uncertainty out there, not only with the countries with whom we‚Äôre negotiating but with people back home, from farmers to manufacturers and even consumers." @WPR https://t.co/CUlo916vsp As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy and supporting small and family farms is the Farm Bill. Yesterday, I released my 2018 Farm Bill Priorities Report, which you can find on my website: https://t.co/uXgUc7eg2S https://t.co/QBRbG5neUh If you have ideas about how Congress or the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus can help with the conservation effort, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to my office and make your voice heard. Conserving our environment today leads to a healthier #Wisconsin tomorrow. https://t.co/rCy1J860tu These tariffs are a direct response to the President‚Äôs short-sighted trade decisions. It‚Äôs time that we stop treating our allies like our enemies, and set trade standards that support Wisconsin jobs. https://t.co/ScYjTFUKQ4 There are no winners in trade wars ‚Äî only losers. The impacts on American manufacturers and the retribution exacted upon American farmers and ranchers will be substantial, costing us more jobs than will be saved. 
It's time for Congress to reclaim its powers over trade policies. https://t.co/Mc4IEJMPWy Happy Pride Month to all of the LGBTQ people &amp; allies in western and central Wisconsin. Proud to fight for equality and inclusivity today, and every day! #Equality #PrideMonth https://t.co/5O6H4U1fql Everyone loses in a trade war. This news is only the beginning of an unnecessary and costly conflict with our closest trading partners. https://t.co/D2PNnmqOve Happy Dairy Month to everyone in Wisconsin, and thank you to our hardworking dairy farmers and farm families! You make Wisconsin America's Dairyland! 
https://t.co/ljIdEkiHzQ Whether we‚Äôre canoeing on the Kickapoo or sitting in a tree-stand, Tawni &amp; I have always loved getting outside with our boys. It‚Äôs my hope that we can carry on these outdoor traditions for years to come which is why I‚Äôm a proud new member of the bipartisan #ClimateSolutionsCaucus https://t.co/aASU11BBU1 The consequences of this shortsighted decision will be widespread across WI, and will immediately threaten jobs in industries and businesses Wisconsin is proud of, like cranberries, breweries and manufacturers. https://t.co/VE7ge1mAjz One of my favorite summer traditions is driving across Wisconsin with my family to local county dairy breakfasts.

Interested veterans should go to https://t.co/O9C9utkW9x &amp; search ‚ÄúWounded Warrior Fellowship Program‚Äù for more information and how to apply. https://t.co/U4266tvTCe Great to see college/business partnerships, like Mason's internship opportunity he had at @Skyward_Inc and @UWStevensPoint. Congrats to Mason, and all of our Wisconsin graduates! #WIProud üéìhttps://t.co/CX7MHuP0mO @RepRonKind's statement on the 2018 Farm Bill: https://t.co/TgwZdJgO1t RT @sustainableag: .@RepRonKind understands that hardworking families need a bill that supports farmers. Instead the #GOPFarmBill just atta‚Ä¶ I have never seen a worse Farm Bill than what‚Äôs being debated in the House today. This isn‚Äôt what our farmers need, and not how Washington should function. This #FarmBill is our chance to fix what‚Äôs not working for our farmers, not funnel more giveaways to millionaires &amp; huge agribusiness. The Farm Bill in its current form will force our farmers to work harder just to get by. Unacceptable. This week, the House Rules Committee voted to block my money-saving, bipartisan amendments to the Farm Bill. This is yet another example of Washington putting itself before hardworking Wisconsin farmers, workers, and families. I have traveled across Wisconsin to meet with our farmers, and hear the same thing over and over: Now, more than ever, we need a bill that levels the playing field. As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy &amp; supporting small &amp; family farms is the #FarmBill. I also know the crisis that our farmers face every day. Farms are closing, families are out of work, &amp; people feel betrayed. On #IDAHOT -  and every day -  I'm proud to stand up against hate and celebrate diversity. https://t.co/opojz84yFp We need to come together and demand a better Farm Bill that works for Wisconsin farmers, families, and communities. #FarmBill https://t.co/K1mARsipkX Wisconsin small businesses, schools and families depend on a free and open internet. Senate Democrats are moving one step closer on a vote to #SaveTheInternet. Proud to support a similar #NetNeutrality bill here in the House. It's always an honor to meet and thank our area veterans as they depart on a Freedom Honor Flight. I wish Michael, his father, and his uncle the best as they travel to DC to see the memorials that stand in their honor. https://t.co/Jp6LIzcS93 This week I've been in Wisconsin &amp; meeting with farmers about what they want to see changed in the upcoming Farm Bill.

What's your favorite library in western or central Wisconsin? #NationalLibraryWeek Thanks to everyone who braved the cold weather this morning and joined me at my Trempealeau County Listening Session in Whitehall. As I always say, the best ideas come from Wisconsinites! https://t.co/4O23YPYCGI Always enjoy talking with Brian Winnekins over at @RealCountry1430 in Durand. Thanks for having me on! https://t.co/HkwLku2cAe Had a great conversation this morning with Bob Bosold at WAXX in Eau Claire. We talked about the upcoming farm bill, and the importance of fixing the bill to put family and small farming operations ahead of large agribusiness. https://t.co/FWYe49AdAg This year, I am proud to announce that my office was able to return $102,109.57 to pay down the national debt!
