Ok. I know this is going to result in the staff-driven imposition of Tweeting Rule #4, but it’s been a long-assed week and I cannot stop laughing: https://t.co/lpcY8FA4Yx @kenkrayeske @GOP And the problem with the public option, for which I fought hard, and faced thousands of angry town hall attendees, was that the party DID compromise with the demands of those who opposed it. Sadly. But we got the ACA, which has helped millions. @kenkrayeske @GOP I think that those touched by opioid addiction or prey to the inequities of our penal system would answer your question with: "a very good start".
https://t.co/6daErQ3inC

https://t.co/uG9KluA8Ac @kenkrayeske @GOP Wow. That’s quite the leap. You said you can’t compromise with the gop. I pointed out a few examples where it happened. Important, because they have the senate and presidency. If you were right, all progress would be impossible. @4671129 You seem nice. @moderatetoright @WSJ Right. Let me take you all the way back to November 6, 2018. @tjcurt Hahahahaha @kenkrayeske @GOP Well, we did on the First Step Act, a significant prison reform bill. And we did on a substantial opiate crisis bill. And we saved SNAP in the Ag bill. So I think “can’t” is a little strong. @CopeClay @alexplitsas @jimhimes And Alex, yes. Was ready in 2013 when GOP Speaker refused to bring a strong bipartisan Senate bill to the House Floor, and have been ready as Trump has rejected compromise proposal after compromise proposal. @CopeClay @alexplitsas @jimhimes I’m proud of your partner. Great story.

I am defending a better and more careful political dialog. @gelliottmorris Ah, now we have the modifier “implies” rather than equivalence. But is it not possible that Mr. Schultz means what he says, that it is unamerican to say something “can’t succeed”? That’s kind of true. But instead he’s a fascist? @pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Part of the reason we’ve been quiet is that the committee hasn’t technically existed for a month. @pwnedlib @gelliottmorris So instead of sitting on a train having a beer perusing Twitter, I should be “doing investigative work”. Perhaps down the way in the Quiet Car? @pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Fair enough. As far as I can tell, he has no discernible reason for running other than self-regard and frustration. @pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Also a logical fallacy. The thing about defending the truth is that it’s most important to do when it is unpopular to do so. Comfort with convenient untruths is the fuel for con men and sophists. @gelliottmorris Dude. I carry no H2O for Mr. Schultz. But you’re a journalist. For The Economist no less. UnAmerican is not the equivalent of fascist. The President thinks the intelligence community is wrong. The Republicans voted in favor of government shutdowns today. And Chicago is deliberately lighting its train tracks on fire.
