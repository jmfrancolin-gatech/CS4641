May this year’s Festival of Lights brighten your family’s home. https://t.co/YHg6QJEjx6 Today we remember President George H.W. Bush, who embodied public service and patriotism. He was a fierce competitor, yet showed us bipartisanship and decency is possible. As Democrats take back the House, we should strive to recapture those values for our nation. https://t.co/0IBNGWqPVJ Thank you Senator Tim Scott for following your conscious and doing the right thing. Thomas Farr had no place serving on our federal bench. https://t.co/8X8Wuu1F6j Today I was proud to vote for @NancyPelosi for Speaker at the Democratic Caucus meeting. However, DC will be denied a vote when the House elects a Speaker in the next Congress. #DCStatehood is the only way to ensure full voting rights for our 700,000 taxpaying residents.

Be sure to bring up #DCStatehood with relatives! https://t.co/LKv0ZWKcfi .@NancyPelosi is the only Democrat with the track record to be Speaker at this time. We need her leadership now more than ever. https://t.co/Cjt6Hrp2ny Tune in now! https://t.co/vV6UV7Rm7C I’ll be on @MSNBC at 6:20pm to lay out the reasons why @NancyPelosi deserves to be speaker and to lead our party as we take back the House majority. @TheBeatWithAri Democrats turn out in presidential elections but often lose midterms because of low turnout. This year’s 38-seat (so far) win defied both midterm history and iron-fisted Republican gerrymandering. Have you noticed? The Members who say they won’t vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker give no reasons why based on her service and leadership. That’s because there are none. Thank you @RepDelBene for cosponsoring our #DCStatehood bill! 100% of Washington state House Democrats now support our fight to make the other Washington the 51st state! https://t.co/4jJkhj3gxJ Ahead of one-year anniversary of the U.S. Park Police shooting of Bijan Ghaisar, @RepDonBeyer and I introduced a bill to require uniformed fed police officers to wear body cameras &amp; use dashboard cameras to ensure transparency &amp; accountability, which benefits victims &amp; officers. https://t.co/Jfwqcw1XAQ Today I sent a letter welcoming newly-elected Members of the House and Senate to the nation’s capital by offering vital information on DC neighborhoods, services and amenities, and asked them to respect home rule and to cosponsor our #DCStatehood bill. https://t.co/BS2VXfauTw In nearly every jurisdiction, except DC, Congress requires fed officials, i.e. district court judges, to live in the district they serve. I’m introducing a bill to require no less from the directors of @DC_CSOSA &amp; DC’s Pretrial Services Agency, which uniquely serve DC residents. Thank you @RepPeteAguilar for cosponsoring our #DCStatehood bill! Very grateful for your support as we round out the vast majority of Democrats who have become cosponsors in this Congress before we take the gavel in the coming Democratic majority. https://t.co/Fe3NPdqKwD Thank you Rep. @BradSherman for cosponsoring our #DCStatehood bill! Your support is a boost for our push for the first House floor vote on DC statehood since I got our very first statehood floor vote in the 103rd Congress. https://t.co/EY08cQpV8X
