U.S. - a lawsuit that would dismantle protections for the 5M Pennsylvanians w/ pre-existing conditions. So grateful for @GabbyGiffords' leadership on gun violence prevention. Eight years after the tragic shooting in Tucson, little has changed. That is unacceptable. I'm cosponsoring #HR8 because we need background checks on every gun purchase. Period. https://t.co/0v7XksagSh Most of the immigrants at our border are women and children seeking refuge. The president is manufacturing a crisis, spreading false and hateful information, and fear mongering - all to gain support for his vanity project that will do little to secure our borders #EndtheShutdown Border security is vital to the safety of our nation. But a wall is not the most effective way to secure our borders. What is? Paying the people who secure our borders and giving them the resources they need to do their jobs BY REOPENING THE GOVERNMENT. #EndtheShutdown The real crisis in this country is presidential leadership willing to use the paychecks and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Americans as bargaining chips to pay for a vanity project that will be ineffective at protecting our borders. #EndtheShutdown 97% of Americans support commonsense background check laws &amp; yet Congress has refused to take action to put them in place. Enough is enough. I'm proud to support #HR8, The Bipartisan Background Checks Act - a vital step toward ending gun violence #NeverAgain .@POTUS is acting as if forgoing a paycheck or two (or three or four, if this continues) is a small price to pay to protect our country: a) these two things are not mutually exclusive &amp; b) the best way to secure our borders right now is to pay the people who secure them .@POTUS continues to fear monger to gain support for his wall. The false claims are harmful and unhelpful - Americans aren't sure how they're going to put food on the table without their next paycheck while the Trump admin is spreading fear about terrorism https://t.co/9BSrazvRxl The #TrumpShutdown is hurting:

-Coast Guard Members/TSA &amp; Border Patrol Agents AKA the people who secure our borders
-Federal workers/public servants
-PA families who rely on tax returns, SNAP, natl parks

NOT FOUND: POTUS/Congressional Republicans AKA those causing the shutdown Looks like there will be one more Saint in New Orleans next weekend! #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/mNy44Zb5xy #ForThePeopleAct will boost ethics laws &amp; end #CultureofCorruption by:

-Applying conflict of interest laws to POTUS &amp; VP &amp; require release of their tax returns
-Closing loopholes that let former MoCs go straight into lobbying
-Ending the revolving door between industry &amp; govt #ForThePeopleAct will end the influence of big money in politics by:

-Requiring all political organizations to disclose large donors
-Updating political ad laws for the digital age
-Creating a public matching system
-Revamping the FEC to ensure enforcement of campaign laws #ForThePeopleAct will make it easier - not harder - for every American to vote by:

-Implementing automatic voter reg, early voting &amp; vote by mail
-Reauthorizing the #VotingRightsAct
-Ending gerrymandering
-Securing our elections by modernizing &amp; strengthening our voting systems As promised, @HouseDemocrats are tackling one of the most important issues facing our Democracy: our political system itself. 

Too many Americans feel that the system is rigged against them - &amp; in many ways it is. 

#ForThePeopleAct will return the government to the people. .@POTUS doesn't know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck. He'll never have to get a loan to pay the mortgage if he misses a paycheck. He doesn't know the fear that 800k hardworking Americans are feeling during a govt shutdown he refuses to end. https://t.co/5DxGtok6rr RT @thehill: Speaker Nancy Pelosi: "We‚Äôre not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt about that? We are not doing a wall. So that‚Äôs that‚Ä¶ Just a reminder that the appropriations bills passed by the House on Thursday would fully restore the federal government‚Äôs services.

It's time for the Senate to act and @POTUS to stop holding the government - and the paychecks and livelihoods of our public servants - hostage. https://t.co/hMv5yaSheq 800,000 Coast Guard members &amp; public servants don't know when they'll get their next paycheck &amp; Trump officials are getting raises?? And now @POTUS is threatening to shut down the government for months or years? Unacceptable. https://t.co/nSk2mD35Gh? Proud to join my fellow Democrats in keeping our promise to get the government back into the hands of the American people. #HR1 https://t.co/YcTXJhvtxy Happy to be here with my PA pals.  Together, we‚Äôve made history! https://t.co/CFLoaGG8Mj What a day! Was officially sworn into the 116th Congress to represent #PA07 with my family at my side and had the honor of voting for @SpeakerPelosi with my son on the House floor with me. Can‚Äôt wait to get to work! https://t.co/ssFebiVJ2H Look who came to see me right before getting sworn into represent #PA07! I look forward to carrying on @RepCharlieDent‚Äôs legacy of working across party lines on behalf of Lehigh Valley families. https://t.co/QI6cYgyXAG Thrilled to announce I introduced my first bill today! It would fund the Coast Guard during the shutdown to ensure our men and women in uniform are getting paid. To truly keep our borders secure, we should pay the people responsible for securing them.

I believe we can make good on our promise to lift up the most vulnerable in our communities, to invest in our young people and to provide equal opportunities for success to all who reach for it. I am convinced that, ultimately, the pull of progress will prove stronger than the toxicity of hyperpartisanship, that shared purpose will win out over divisive rhetoric, that unity will overcome prejudice, that hope will triumph over fear https://t.co/ynReTZm4WT For people across our state and our country ‚Äî whether Republicans, Democrats or independents ‚Äî the sentiment that establishment thinking in Washington has failed to deliver results for working and middle-class families has long gone unheard. https://t.co/ynReTZm4WT The #TrumpShutdown provides consequences for services and agencies across the board and threatens long-term security. We must be more cautious in our governing. https://t.co/9uYKF8v2CC Ahead of these next two years, this is my commitment to you: As one of 435 representatives, I will fight for a Congress and a country that reflects the best of our community and national character ‚Äî and a future worthy of our people. https://t.co/ynReTZ4u5l As long as the government is shutdown over 42,000 active-duty Coast Guardsmen will not receive their paychecks. It is unfair to place the burden of this shutdown on our military families who can not afford to miss a paycheck. We must fund DHS to ensure these workers get paid. https://t.co/5rbztZT5tN RT @WNEP: Shutdown to cut office overseeing federal food stamps by 95%

This is no way to treat civil servants over the holidays. It is discouraging that with a bipartisan deal on the table that has passed the Senate, the White House is still choosing an unnecessary partisan shutdown https://t.co/02AjA8CdK0 #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/IhVrEpeok7 The repeal of Don‚Äôt Ask Don‚Äôt Tell brings us closer to the principles of equality and fairness that define us as Americans. No one should be excluded from serving their country, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity.
