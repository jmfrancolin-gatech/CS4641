The United States has a lot to give immigrants and refugees—and a lot to receive. By showing no empathy for the plights of people like Mr. Solera, the current administration does damage to people who desperately need our help and to the future of our country. Valdir Solera is my guest for tonight’s #SOTU. He's a Brazilian refugee who escaped human trafficking and now lives on Maui. Today he is a tour guide, an environmentalist, and an advocate for other refugees. https://t.co/PlXEpwX0GM People have gone without food, medicine, and gas in their car because of this shutdown, but delayed flights are what brings us to this moment? Shame on us. https://t.co/reIftKaQ52 4. Public safety is at grave risk. 3. The people who are most vulnerable have been left to fend for themselves. 2. Economic growth is slowing. 1. Federal workers are in food lines. There are at least four failures brought by this shutdown that should be unacceptable to any reasonable person. https://t.co/ql7m5gYP09 All this pain and suffering because the Senate won’t vote to re-open the government. Let’s vote to reopen the government. He doesn’t know how he’s going to buy gas to take his husband to the doctor, or how they’re going to pay bills that are due. Scott is making impossible choices between buying the prescription drugs he needs, and the ones his husband needs. Scott and Jay spent all their savings to get through this ordeal. After paying for medicine, hotels, and airfare, they were living paycheck to paycheck. Now, because of the government shutdown, Scott’s paycheck reads zero dollars. In October, his husband, Jay, went in to the hospital for a routine surgery that went horribly wrong. Jay went into cardiac arrest, and was in an induced coma for several days. He had to be flown to another island to receive the care he needed. One of those people is Scott Pekalib. He lives in Hilo and works for the U.S. Geological Survey. https://t.co/i8lqWcfcRi I have a simple request for my Republican colleagues: let's vote to re-open the government. There are too many people suffering for this to go on any longer. https://t.co/RSRTyjSLXh RT @CNET: Federal data privacy bill introduced by 15 US Senators https://t.co/mh5OD8MiKm https://t.co/lvRWBf1g2M RT @TechCrunch: Senators aim to give internet companies doctor-like duties to protect our data https://t.co/JpW1V1sxwU https://t.co/DUT7hy6… Thank you @SenatorHassan, @SenBennetCO, @SenDuckworth, @SenAmyKlobuchar, @PattyMurray, @SenBooker, @SenCortezMasto, @MartinHeinrich, @SenMarkey, @SenSherrodBrown, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenDougJones, @Sen_JoeManchin, and @SenatorDurbin for joining me in cosponsoring the #DataCareAct.

Seventeen years later, the courage and unity shown by so many on that fateful day still inspires us to come together, to serve, and to do something that’s bigger than ourselves. This resolution also “condemns attacks on the institution of the free press and views efforts to systematically undermine the credibility of the press as a whole as an attack on our democratic institution.” .@SenSchumer &amp; I have introduced a resolution that does just this. It affirms that the press is not the enemy of the people. And it reaffirms the vital role the free press serves to inform the electorate, uncover truth, act as a check &amp; advance democratic norms &amp; freedoms. These words of past leaders should inspire this body to act—to send a message that we support the First Amendment, and we support the freedom of the press. Or Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote that “the First Amendment is often inconvenient. But that is beside the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the government of its obligation to tolerate speech.” Or President Reagan, who said that “freedom of the press is one of our most important freedoms, and also one of our oldest. Or James Madison, who said that “the freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.” We can't let statements by @POTUS declaring the press is the enemy of the people go unchallenged. Both parties complain about the media but who would argue w/ Thomas Jefferson who wrote: “our liberty depends on the freedom of the press &amp; that cannot be limited without being lost” Every member of Congress has sworn to uphold the Constitution, including the right to the #FreePress. I’m introducing a bill to uphold our oath and make clear that we support liberty and free speech.

They have left behind friends, families, and most of what they own to come to our border because they have no other choice. This #WorldRefugeeDay, it’s incumbent on everyone to remember that. Usually the United States spends #WorldRefugeeDay highlighting how we help refugees. But today, we’re facing our own human rights crisis at the southern border. This is not who we are. The forced separation of families is a moral outrage, and must end. #WithRefugees All 49 @SenateDems have signed on to a bill that stops this madness. The Senate is split 51-49. That means it only takes two senators to put an end to this moral crisis.

I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.” -Laura Bush “The bosom of America is open to receive not only the Opulent and respected Stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions; whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges…” -George Washington “Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.’” -Matthew 19:13-14 “When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” -Leviticus 19:33-34 We can disagree on immigration policy. But we cannot disagree on what’s happening at our southern border. It is a moral outrage. And you do not have to take my word for it.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that the United States can meet our original commitment to the Paris Agreement, even if the EPA continues to undermine our efforts. When it comes to the Paris Agreement, U.S. companies, states, and cities have stood up to declare “We Are Still In.” The economics are on our side. Clean energy is now cheaper than dirty energy. We continue to move to a low-carbon economy. The rest of the world is moving forward.

WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/Grt0WVhBNZ On #EqualPayDay, we’re reminded that gender inequality costs women, families &amp; our economy far too much. Time to close the gender pay gap. Proud to work with @SenatorRisch, @SenJohnThune, @SenatorCantwell, and @SenBillNelson to protect small businesses and American consumers. https://t.co/9pnybo0dMO 60% of small biz that suffer a cyberattack are out of business in 6 months. I intro'd a bill to help them fight back https://t.co/S5Qu0jkiYe RT @SenBrianSchatz: Republicans are trying to take away the few online privacy protections we have. It’s irresponsible. Here’s why: https:/… Republicans are trying to take away the few online privacy protections we have. It’s irresponsible. Here’s why: https://t.co/7czh8Kebol If the @SenateGOP gets their way today, your personal online info will be sold to the highest bidder. We need to protect #BroadbandPrivacy. While the FCC has made progress on protecting #BroadbandPrivacy, Republicans want to roll it back and put big business before Americans. Our #BroadbandPrivacy is worth protecting. Here’s why:  https://t.co/JwEqr9hJVb From banking to healthcare, we are constantly connected to the internet. We should be doing more to protect our #BroadbandPrivacy, not less. .@USCBO score is clear: At least 24 million will lose health care under #TrumpCare. We can't impose this catastrophe on the American people. https://t.co/QYFYCr2Ldz RT @SenateDems: Pres Trump promised “everyone” would get covered. But #Trumpcare would leave 24 million more Americans uninsured. https://t… On #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate the women who have made our a world better place https://t.co/LvNhDqfr0s #TrumpCare is not the answer. We need to find a better way forward on health care. https://t.co/xADyBH5eV4 9/ Finally, this is too partisan. We have the opportunity to work together to improve health care. This isn't the way to do it. 8/ #TrumpCare also defunds Planned Parenthood. This would stop low-income women from getting critical health services. 7/ #TrumpCare will trash mental health coverage and rip away care from people who are counting on it. 6/ #TrumpCare will blow up the debt and deficit and we have no idea how many people will lose coverage. 5/ #TrumpCare is not a health care bill. It is a tax cut for rich people. 4/ #TrumpCare will hit the elderly with an age tax. They could be charged up to 5x as much as a younger person for insurance.
