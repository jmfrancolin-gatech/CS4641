Lucy and I are sending our heartfelt prayers to @RepDebDingell and the entire Dingell family. John Dingell dedicated his life to public service and he will be dearly missed. But much work remains to be done. As we look towards the future, I urge Republicans and Democrats alike to lay down their arms, stop the political grandstanding and work together to build a safer and more prosperous America. #SOTU Thanks to the progress we have made over the past two years, the state of our union is strong. Fueled by tax reform and deregulation, our economy has come roaring back to life, creating new jobs and opportunities for millions of Americans. #SOTU The U.S. economy is still roaring. 304,000 new jobs added in January, nearly twice as many as expected. #JobsReport If this shutdown has shown us one thing, it is that we need Congressional #termlimits. And we need them now.
