To the people of #Venezuela, we stand with you‚Ä¶ If not‚Äìif Dems cont to embrace open borders @ the expense of the American people‚Äì today‚Äôs actions have made it all but inevitable that @POTUS will declare a national emergency &amp; deploy the funds &amp; manpower necessary to build a steel barrier @ high-traffic locations on the border. We must keep our word to the American people.
 
Perhaps the Democrats will end their partisan obstruction, set aside their hatred of the president, and agree to a reasonable compromise to actually secure the border. I hope so. We have a crisis at our border, one that Texas experiences first-hand. We need real border security, including physical barriers to stop drug traffickers and human traffickers. I will continue to lead the fight to secure the border and get the job done. Given their behavior, there is considerable reason to be skeptical of their claim. We will see if they actually meant what they said. The media will obsess over the short-term political fight. But what matters is enacting real solutions to the real problems of this country. .@SenSchumer and the Democrats cynically objected to that legislation and killed it on the Senate floor.
 
The Democrats have claimed that, once the shutdown ends, they are willing to negotiate in good faith to secure the border. Yesterday, I fought hard to immediately pay every single essential federal employee ‚Äì every essential employee at the Coast Guard, the TSA, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, ICE agents, FBI agents, and those throughout law enforcement. I am glad the Schumer shutdown is over. I am glad federal workers will finally be paid. For weeks, Democrats held their paychecks hostage. I will continue to stand with the working men &amp; women of this country &amp; fight for common-sense solutions that respect the will of the American people. #SchumerShutdown --&gt; https://t.co/dpDaRWla8E That is why I have also introduced the EL CHAPO Act &amp; the WALL Act ‚Äì 2 bills that would secure our border by funding the wall &amp; fully paying for it. #SecureTheBorder I have repeatedly called for building a wall as a necessary step in defending our border and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country. #SecureTheBorder Now, it's just politics; their extreme position is driven by hatred for the president. That is an untenable position, and the American people will continue to suffer so long as @SenSchumer and the Democrats persist in shutting down the government to spite the president. But @SenSchumer &amp; the Dems would rather keep the government shut down in service of raw political gamesmanship. Their position is no compromise, no negotiation &amp; no wall, no matter what, despite the fact that the Democrats have previously voted overwhelmingly to build the wall. The only reason that we didn't put a bill on the president's desk immediately to pay these essential federal workers now is that the Democrats cynically objected, instead holding the workers hostage to try to win a political war with the president. #SchumerShutdown I am a co-sponsor of legislation that would pay them all now; if you are being forced to work, basic fairness dictates you should be paid. Today @SenSchumer &amp; the Dems also objected to paying the @USCG &amp; to paying all essential federal workers--some 425,000 federal workers including TSA officers, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, ICE officers, FBI agents &amp; others essential to our national security. Despite @SenSchumer and the Democrats speaking for years about their concern for the Dreamers, they nevertheless voted down the president's offer of protection for Dreamers. I agreed to the president's compromise because it didn't extend amnesty to anybody not covered already under current law and, critically, it didn't create a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. In exchange, the president offered to provide a three-year extension of status limited to current DACA recipients and current enrollees in TPS. @POTUS The president put forward a reasonable compromise to end this shutdown. This plan secures our border, funds the construction of a much-needed border wall, and reopens the federal government. #SecureTheBorder Today I joined a bipartisan majority in voting for @POTUS‚Äô plan to secure our border &amp; reopen the gov. The president asked me to support his plan &amp; I did bc I agree w him that border security is unquestionably a national priority &amp; that we must build a wall to secure the border.

Before the @March_for_Life, @NateOnTheHill talks w/ @sen‚Ä¶ Today millions are marching in DC &amp; across the nation. Why do we march? We march for the unborn of our generation &amp; generations to come. We march in prayerful protest of the horrific injustice against the unborn &amp; their mothers. We march in celebration of life. #whywemarch https://t.co/SQuW4TdHQV I look forward to working with my colleagues and President Trump to defend against these threats by developing and eventually deploying SBI. --&gt; https://t.co/3xFmejPcmt The deployment of SBI is critical to engaging missiles when they are at their most vulnerable stage, ascending at slow velocity with high heat signatures, as well as when they are most resilient, traveling through space with decoys and evasive measures. In the meantime, China and Russia have invested in the development of ballistic missile technology that our existing systems cannot stop, and Iran and North Korea continue to pursue nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Past missile defense reviews have failed to consider the technologies that are needed to protect Americans and the American homeland. I commend President Trump for recognizing and prioritizing missile defense, and for highlighting the need for space-based interceptors (SBI), in the Missile Defense Review. --&gt; https://t.co/3xFmejPcmt RT @SenTedCruz: In 2013 @SenSchumer &amp; Senate Democrats voted for 350 miles of additional border fencing &amp; border security.

https://‚Ä¶ This bill re-includes homeschoolers &amp; empowers every family with access to an education that truly fits their child‚Äôs needs. I am proud to champion school choice with @RepJasonSmith &amp; am hopeful my colleagues will move swiftly to empower all students. --&gt; https://t.co/wGjrc4IqY3 https://t.co/uNt6tD5AVf Under the Student Opportunity Amendment, homeschool families were wrongly and cynically excluded by Senate Democrats, leaving them ineligible to utilize the expanded usage of 529 savings accounts. This bill builds upon my Student Opportunity Amendment, which was signed into law in December 2017, by allowing all students ‚Äì including public, private, religious, and homeschool students ‚Äì to use 529 savings accounts to cover eligible educational expenses. This week @RepJasonSmith and I reintroduced the Student Empowerment Act, which would expand 529 College Savings Plans to include K-12 elementary and secondary school expenses for public, private, and religious schools, including homeschool students. --&gt; https://t.co/wGjrc4IqY3 https://t.co/z7NfvGlv4t I will continue to urge this administration to vigorously counter Russia, and maintain sanctions‚Äô pressure on corrupt cronies and nefarious companies. Now these companies will reenter the market, driving down costs and increasing the competitiveness of U.S. firms, including firms that employ tens of thousands of Texans. As Senate Democrats know well, this agreement weakens Deripaska--a very bad actor--which is why our European allies, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, support the Treasury's decision. They forced the companies to agree to a deal that permanently takes away Deripaska‚Äôs controls, denies personal profits, and implements meaningful checks to prevent backsliding or cheating in exchange for lifting sanctions. The Treasury Department told those companies that those sanctions would not be lifted until Deripaska gave up his control. Last year the Trump administration correctly targeted a sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, and sanctioned three Russian companies he controlled, including aluminum companies. Much work remains to be done to clarify and apply these standards, including in Iran where sanctioned entities like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps control entire sectors of the economy, and I support implementing legislation as aggressively as possible. One of the most important elements of this sanctions legislation is that it directly targets oligarchs and terrorists who control companies in important industries. I joined my colleagues in 2017 in voting for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to turn the tide in pushing back against Russian hostility &amp; have urged the admin to broadly sanction Iranian, Russian &amp; North Korean bad actors pursuant to that legislation. Russia‚Äôs hostile actions include bolstering Iran and Assad in Syria, illegally annexing Crimea, and launching waves of cyberattacks against us and our allies. The Obama administration refused to hold Putin accountable. And, for eight years, President Obama--with the active support of Senate Democrats--demonstrated weakness and appeasement towards Russia, which only encouraged Russian aggression. Senate Democrats have already shut down the government to prevent commonsense border security, and just this week they have filibustered legislation to strengthen Israel and weaken America's enemies. Putin is a KGB thug, and Russia is not our friend. And sanctions are an important tool for pressing back on Russia, which is why I have consistently helped lead the fight to enact sanctions.
 
The Chuck Schumer resolution, however, was simply political gamesmanship. I was happy to recommend Wes, Mark &amp; Sean to @POTUS. They each bring to the bench a proven record of professionalism and excellence. I commend the President for these nominations and urge my colleagues to quickly confirm them to the bench. https://t.co/WVQGFOhhes via @whitehouse Pleasure to meet with former Texas State Representative Molly White &amp; pro-life advocates at my DC office today. #ProLife https://t.co/tk1uVxgAyK I am committed to ensuring that the United States is a global leader with vibrant and growing aviation and space industries that are able to compete on the world stage and in the new frontiers of space. --&gt; https://t.co/0bdeFppNJ9
