A win-win. https://t.co/j2NHiGZi6X Ahead of the @March_for_Life tomorrow, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of pro-life policies. We are divided on so many issues today, but protecting the lives of unborn children should not be one of those issues. #whywemarch https://t.co/9iPJQUymX2 Please join me in saying a prayer today for the U.S. service members killed in Syria.

Bush today. A very moving tribute to an incredible man. #Remembering41 https://t.co/cvFJP8eAdp Check out the video from the nomination hearing today: https://t.co/Lb1q2VeA2g On October 30, Secretaries Mattis &amp; Pompeo called for a ceasefire in 30 days. Deadline was November 29. Yet, Saudi airstrikes continue. It is not in our national security interests to do nothing when Riyadh clearly and directly ignores our Secretaries of Defense and State. Today in #SFRC, the administration’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Yemen said the civil war has exacerbated the world’s largest food security emergency, created power vacuums that terrorists have exploited, facilitated Iran’s ambitions, and complicated our CT efforts. If you’re a fan of podcasts you’ll want to listen to my @OppStartsatHome interview with Mike Koprowski. We discussed the housing affordability crisis and my efforts to tackle this growing issue: https://t.co/JjLJAS2Z5w https://t.co/E0leM6jJnM I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation, and I will continue working with Indiana stakeholders to ensure that it accomplishes its goals. https://t.co/cYWADyXwNz The First Step Act will make needed reforms to our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism, create fairer sentencing requirements, and prepare inmates to be successful members of society.

Unfortunately, the administration has failed to fully utilize the leverage I have provided, and today’s briefing raised more questions than it answered. Since March of 2017, I have worked to give the administration leverage with the Saudis to accomplish these outcomes. We must use all of that leverage immediately. I have studied the situation in Yemen as closely as anyone in the Senate, &amp; I believe the best way to oppose Iran in Yemen &amp; stop ballistic missile attacks on our partners is to bring all parties to the negotiating table, end the civil war, &amp; address the humanitarian crisis. I’m heading to the @SenateFloor shortly to discuss my reaction to today’s #Yemen briefing with Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis. https://t.co/EaaHtjFqg3 Entrepreneurs fuel Indiana’s small business community.

Please join me in thanking all #veterans today. As a proud Marine, I have great respect and gratitude for the patriotic men and women who have served in our nation’s Armed Forces to defend our cherished freedoms. Today we recognize America’s veterans for their dedicated service to our nation. #VeteransDay is a time to honor the sacrifices of all who have served, as well as the sacrifices of their families. Honoring our veterans in Indianapolis today. https://t.co/RUOUKK99ma Just left @indianastate in Terre Haute where @SecretaryAcosta and I spoke about retirement security. More than 40 million people do not have access to any workplace retirement plan. We discussed ways to help Hoosiers save for the future. https://t.co/GFGAtBzkpc Because of #taxreform, @GaylorElectric was able to invest their savings in a mobile innovation center that provides on-the-go and on-the-spot training to students and electricians at their projects. https://t.co/B2oQCI0qMA America faces a skills gap as technological advances continue to transform the workforce. We are discussing ways to better prepare Americans with the skills needed for 21st century jobs. https://t.co/5YYDwyLvjW One of our first stops is @GaylorElectric in Noblesville. Gaylor Electric’s #apprenticeship program is one example of how work-based learning benefits both businesses and Americans entering the workforce in today’s economy. https://t.co/5SfhAL31on I’m hosting U.S. Secretary of Labor @SecretaryAcosta in Indiana today to discuss apprenticeships, workforce development, and retirement security. https://t.co/9ICfQeENgL I thank Attorney General Sessions for his distinguished public service to the nation.

We witnessed their work on advanced energy solutions – including a jet pack and hover car. https://t.co/xBs9YeJa2h Visited Fishers High School today to speak with their government class, and I was interviewed by students participating in @CSPAN's StudentCam scholarship program.

We stand united against anti-Semitism as we work to oppose hate in all its forms. #StrongerTogether https://t.co/eh75ie8pq8 A story published last night by @USATODAY’s @dshesgreen  details my efforts over the last year and a half to end the civil war in Yemen and alleviate the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. https://t.co/oURWI0CeI5 I look forward to partnering with the administration to hold all parties to the conflict accountable. I have called for a U.S.-led diplomatic surge on Yemen since March of 2017, and I am pleased that the administration is finally and unambiguously drawing the line in terms of what we expect from all parties—including the Saudis. https://t.co/kpWzk06joy Today, I met with Caretenders Home Health Care in New Albany and visited one of their patients, a Hoosier Air Force veteran named Kenneth. I learned more about the valuable work Caretenders nurses do &amp; why it’s important for patients to have access to this type of care. https://t.co/1QJuFzZ45K It was a great honor to present Mr. Paul Lucas with the Purple Heart. https://t.co/9BhVvaS8Je Indiana will miss Matt Tully. https://t.co/dwoJTAPzc9 I walked into city hall in Columbus this morning and this scavenger hunt group needed a picture with "someone official". I hope I'm official enough. https://t.co/f9FFeKnEtK It was an honor to present Mr. Paul Lucas with the Purple Heart today, which he earned during the Korean War.

This violent act of anti-Semitism goes against everything America stands for and it will not be tolerated. Notre Dame vs. Navy today. As I always say, I’m cheering for who Father Hesburgh cheered for. https://t.co/6hTURcy4Cs .@WTHRcom reports on @POTUS signing the bipartisan opioid package into law– Including my six bills to help us better understand and treat opioid addiction in Indiana and across America. https://t.co/xHTN3yg9Am The ag industry isn’t just critical to Indiana’s economy, it’s also part of our heritage as Hoosiers. Today I visited the @INFarmBureau in Indy to receive the Friend of Farm Bureau award. I'lll continue supporting policies that benefit Hoosier farmers. https://t.co/yzJShiyKpp https://t.co/BsDwrJFBli Today, I met several @IndianaFFA members at @NationalFFA’s #FFAJustOne convention in Indy.
