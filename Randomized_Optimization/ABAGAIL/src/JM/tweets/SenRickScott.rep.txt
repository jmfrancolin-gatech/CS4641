Puerto Rico‚Äôs recovery continues and the United States Congress MUST do everything we can to support that, with responsible safeguards against fraud and waste.

As long as I am a member of the U.S. Senate, I will fight to make sure the people of Puerto Rico are represented. I‚Äôve visited Puerto Rico 8 times since the deadly storm and provided Florida state resources to the citizens of Puerto Rico to aid in rebuilding and recovery. 

But the island still has a long way to go. As Governor of Florida, I worked to be there for the people of Puerto Rico.

@RepJenniffer has been a tireless advocate for Puerto Rico and she has been fighting so hard for this funding. I‚Äôm proud to join her in this fight. I will be speaking on the Senate floor around 5:30PM to discuss my amendment to add disaster relief funding for Puerto Rico to the government funding bill.

I will be going live with @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness right now. 

Tune in! https://t.co/bkhd4BV0mF Until @NicolasMaduro steps down, the U.S. should impose a full ban on Venezuelan oil. 

Our country should not do business with a dictator and a thug like #Maduro who kills and imprisons dissidents and denies basic human rights to his own people!

Tenemos que declarar a #Venezuela un estado terrorista".  https‚Ä¶ .@NicolasMaduro, you should step down NOW. A real leader would listen to his people and step down. 

Do you have the courage to listen to the people of #Venezuela? Or will you continue to be a coward and hide from public opinion and the demands of your people. This evening I was able to call into the Casa de Venezuela Rally in Orlando to stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan community in Florida and in #Venezuela. @jguaido‚Äôs presidency marks a new day for freedom and democracy! Esta noche pude participar de la manifestaci√≥n de Casa de Venezuela Orlando en solidaridad con la comunidad venezolana en la Florida y en #Venezuela. ¬°La presidencia de @jguaido marca un nuevo d√≠a para la libertad y la democracia! https://t.co/aQuEXjrdwY *Former* President Maduro

‚ù§Ô∏èüáªüá™ https://t.co/uYk1QFDXLc If #Maduro doubts the resolve of the United States to support freedom and democracy in #Venezuela and the region, he is sorely mistaken. 

We should consider EVERY option at our disposal to ensure the safety of Americans and support the rightful president. https://t.co/biHoeaODTY As a NATO ally of the U.S. and member of the EU it is unacceptable that Spain is selling military equipment to Caracas and ignoring the EU arms embargo.

It‚Äôs time to stop the arms sales and instead aid Venezuelans in their fight for freedom and democracy!

We need to dramatically reinvent and reimagine government and term limits are the first step. The only people that disagree with that live in DC.

We need to pass this bill TODAY! https://t.co/zzJ6ZHFI6N As Americans, we understand the importance of freedom and liberty in our everyday lives, and it is our duty to stand with those who are oppressed by dictators and denied basic human rights. I stand with #Venezuela and will continue to fight until democracy is restored! Today the people of Venezuela raise their voices in support of the Asamblea Nacional and its president Juan Guaid√≥ and their commitment to restore a constitutional government in #Venezuela. Como estadounidenses, comprendemos la importancia de la democracia y la libertad en nuestra vida cotidiana, y es nuestro deber respaldar a quienes son oprimidos por dictaduras. ¬°Estoy con Venezuela y continuar√© luchando hasta que se restaure la democracia!

Como gobernador, impulse legislaci√≥n en contra de Maduro y hoy le pido al Presidente que agregue a Venezuela a la lista de pa√≠ses patrocinadores del terrorismo. I‚Äôll be meeting with the President today on the atrocities caused by Maduro and his gang of thugs in Venezuela. 

As governor, I championed legislation to go after Maduro and today I am asking the President to add Venezuela to the list of state sponsors of terror. This afternoon I stopped by @TeamTyndall to tour some of the damage from the tornado this weekend and get an update on recovery from Hurricane Michael. I am incredibly grateful for their service and will fight to make sure they have the resources they need to rebuild! https://t.co/3T8Q6Ohc7r RT @10NewsWTSP: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott attend events for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day https://t.co/sY08RsjAgg‚Ä¶ La √∫nica instituci√≥n leg√≠tima en Venezuela es la Asamblea Nacional, que fue elegida por el pueblo venezolano.

Hoy vemos a miembros de la Guardia Nacional venezolana defendiendo la ley y a los ciudadanos. The only legitimate institution in Venezuela is the National Assembly, which was elected by the Venezuelan people. Any act by the Maduro Supreme Court is not valid. 

Today we see members of the Venezuelan National Guard standing up for the rule of law and the citizens. https://t.co/Q4QegOp0UV Great day in Jacksonville! I had the opportunity to celebrate #MLKDay walking in the parade once again this year with many members of the community.
