Thanks to the millions who stood up and demanded better of our immigration system, thousands of children will soon sleep safely with their families. https://t.co/McEUlUYdiR Students defrauded by for-profit colleges should not face financial ruin while their government turns a blind eye. This decision is a direct result of students, alumni and advocates demanding the Dept. of Education take action. Big first step but more work to be done. https://t.co/rvFUrLQbFX RT @trenni: The CDC reports suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among 15-34 year olds. This piece is a heartbreaking but necessary re‚Ä¶ Remember the millions of voices they ignore, the election they forget and the countless lies they told over this campaign. Remember every one of them. They found one judge to agree, and now Medicaid expansion could be gone, preexisting condition protections could be wiped out, prices skyrocket and millions lose insurance. 

And they call that success. They tried to repeal it through Congress. They failed over 60 times. 

They tried lawsuits to the Supreme Court. They failed twice. 

They tried to undermine it administratively. They failed again. Six years ago bullets tore through #SandyHook and changed our country forever. But the laws that should protect us have not budged. To the families, friends and community that lost loved ones that day, we commit not just to their memory but to action. https://t.co/EY2BOr4mpN This #MeToo legislation is long overdue, sorely needed &amp; just a start when it comes to tackling how Congress &amp; some of this country‚Äôs most central institutions give sexual harassment cover. Grateful for all the survivors and advocates who raised their voices and demanded change. https://t.co/jztgWijRuf You meant the ports of entry where you're blocking them from legally seeking asylum?

Proud to see our bipartisan Preventing Maternal Deaths Act led by @RepDianaDeGette and @HerreraBeutler pass the House today. https://t.co/DLT2LUqONP Told by our justice system that his Administration must reunite families they have separated, @realDonaldTrump instead breaks them even further.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to support the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/IKkb8fKuQO Few American communities have been spared the violence of racism, hatred &amp; bigotry this year.

(4/4) I applaud the leadership of @SpeakerDeLeo and @RepTonyCabral in stepping up for Massachusetts workers and making it clear their government has their back. I encourage the Senate and Governor Baker to follow suit. (3/4) While that choice is theirs to make, they should be held financially accountable for its impact. (2/4) Weaponizing critical worker benefits to gain contract concessions has become a too common and toxic corporate practice. National Grid chose to lock out their workers, at great expense to the impacted employees, their families, and our entire Commonwealth. (1/4) https://t.co/tDGXfER7fR As FERC commissioner, Bernard McNamee will choose fossil fuels over the future of our planet every time. His record made that abundantly clear. GOP Senate voted to confirm him today anyways. Now, let's remember the name of every Senator who chose to follow his path. https://t.co/rCkwzTGvt6 Reversing these historic trends requires American leadership. If @realDonaldTrump continues to insist on American retreat, a Democratic Congress must step up and Mitch McConnell cannot stand in our way. https://t.co/msakkR21AN This isn‚Äôt just Scott Walker‚Äôs legacy, but a microcosm of GOP‚Äôs national priorities.

So are the people you serve and every single other country on earth. We must #ActOnClimate today. https://t.co/oq0JaEm0tB A GOP operative in NC tries to undercut an election. A GOP legislature in WI tries to undermine election results. Yet, a simple misunderstanding sends a woman with a green card to prison for 8 years for voting. You tell me what‚Äôs a greater threat to our democracy. In this nation of immigrants, we don't judge those arriving at our shores by the amount of money in their pocket or the color of their skin. We need you to reject the Trump Admin's most recent attack on immigrants and say #NoToPublicCharge here: https://t.co/abMvv863Ba Happy Hanukkah to the families and friends gathered together on this first night. May your celebration be peaceful and joyful! #HappyHanukkah George H.W. Bush‚Äôs life was one of service and sacrifice. He was the very definition of a public servant and a man dedicated to his family.  All of us strive to match those same values. Our thoughts are with the Bush family today. Doctors want nothing more than to find an exit from our nation's ever expanding gun violence lane. Too many have been forced to tell parents their child was taken by a bullet. Please take a few minutes to read this heartbreaking, thoughtful piece by @MGHSurgery's @peter_masiakos. https://t.co/aThRXSG3PJ No better snapshot of our current, toxic capitalism than this: GM shareholders went to bed this week with $10.6B the company has spent on buybacks since ‚Äò15. GM workers went to bed unsure if jobs &amp; livelihoods would be there tomorrow. https://t.co/K9GFvRuIBu This will be the @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs legacy. Asking our next generation to sacrifice today &amp; tomorrow. Lost health care today. Medicare tomorrow. Education today. Student loan interest tomorrow. A clean climate today. And a clean climate tomorrow. This is why we fight back. https://t.co/iVWsz0LBDd Charles Johnson IV is turning unimaginable loss into real change. This is not an easy story to watch. But it‚Äôs a necessary confrontation with the appalling racial injustices in our country‚Äôs system of maternal health. @4kira4moms #maternaljustice https://t.co/BWlDacVOni Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Moral capitalism only works if govt demands it - living wages, labor protections, anti-trust, corporate oversight, tax code, civil rights, family policy, education, the list goes on.

This man doesn‚Äôt belong in public service and he certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve the robes of a federal judge. We must #StopFarr. Equity. A decent standard of living in the richest nation on earth. An economy that rewards all who labor for its success. A system that protects those at the bottom instead of insulating those at the top. A country where the average family can do more than just scrape by. https://t.co/QJHZNCxoj1 I visited this facility. I talked to kids held there for months on end precisely because of exhaustive/inefficient fingerprinting system @realDonaldTrump has imposed on would-be sponsors offering a loving home. https://t.co/JQsYEMIin2 Centuries after welcoming the first pilgrims to their shores, the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe must still fight for their native land. A poignant reminder in the wake of Thanksgiving. https://t.co/ROid71SVw8 This news is not just the result of one company‚Äôs choices. It‚Äôs the result of a system that has loosened the terms of its social contract 1000 times, 1000 ways over the past 50 years - time and again freeing corporations from their responsibilities to those who sweat for them. https://t.co/m8tuGkE43D 14,000 loyal GM employees will clock out tonight to an uncertain future. Meanwhile GM‚Äôs stock soars, benefiting shareholders and shareholders alone.
