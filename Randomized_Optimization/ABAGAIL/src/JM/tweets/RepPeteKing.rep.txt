Terrific conversation w Sal Panico, a Bethpage resident &amp; Korean War era vet, who stopped by my office to say hello. 14 years ago, I obtained Sal's military medals &amp; invited him to my office to thank him for his service. Today, he finally took me up on my offer. A great American. https://t.co/gBylgsXPpD Great meeting with members of @AmDiabetesAssn yesterday. I assured them of my continued support of funding for diabetes prevention and research programs. https://t.co/ZKbtJ8wJRr Will vote for Omnibus Bill for two main reasons: provides the funding to proceed with Gateway Project and allocates necessary Homeland Security funding. I thank @POTUS Trump for being open to discussion and @SenSchumer for his bipartisan cooperation and leadership. Terrific meeting with advocates for research to combat ALS (Lou Gehrig Disease). Hopeful progress is being made but more research funding is necessary. https://t.co/UEZ0L78vQT Meeting with brain aneurysm advocates and survivors -- support more research. https://t.co/Ablta4rOw5 Thoughts and prayers for Long Island Airmen from 106th Rescue Wing of New York Air National Guard in West Hampton Beach &amp; those who tragically died with them in the helicopter crash in Iraq. God Bless America. Rosemary &amp; I with NYC PBA President Patrick Lynch at St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade in Manhattan. ‚òòÔ∏è https://t.co/DCmsB2Tp3a Happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day!! ‚òòÔ∏è Great memories of "The Glider" Ed Charles who died yesterday. Ed Charles was a leader of the 1969 @Mets, a poet and a man of dignity and class. Had the opportunity to meet and talk with him several times. Terrific man. Ed Charles R.I.P. Let's Go Mets!! Disgraceful news that Herman Bell, convicted killer of hero cops Joseph Piagentini &amp; Waverly Jones, is being paroled. My father was in NYPD when they were murdered. I remember how devastated he &amp; all NY were by cold blooded murder of these brave officers. How can Bell be paroled? Met today with New York National Guard leaders to discuss training and funding issues. National Guard does outstanding work in overseas war zones and here at home dealing with natural disasters. https://t.co/GmUSJZOFNF Last night I participated in a symposium at the Library of Congress commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement in Northern Ireland. Other participants included Irish Prime Minister Leo Varakdar, Gerry Adams and George Mitchell. https://t.co/DXuuy4PwOu Excellent meeting with Long Island representatives of the @ArthritisFdn. Arthritis is a debilitating disease and, as a member of the Congressional Arthritis Caucus, I have consistently supported and voted for increased research. Great work by these advocates. https://t.co/TmYszRooLY Mike Pompeo is an outstanding choice for Secretary of State. Experienced, dedicated and a true patriot. Good luck Mike!!
