For nearly 70 yrs, #NATO has been one of the most successful peacetime military alliances. https://t.co/0v1fwMs2Ri Actions today would not reverse the ongoing sabotage on our nation’s health care system. The list is astounding—proposed cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP. Most of the legislation does very little for the average American. https://t.co/rgIOWbVD2Q MA delegation mtg today w/ Brooks Tingle, President &amp; CEO of John Hancock Insurance, &amp; Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science &amp; Policy, to talk about using food to alleviate hunger, improve health outcomes &amp; reduce healthcare costs. https://t.co/sJjX0lkIe1 RT @WaysMeansCmte: Ranking Member @RepRichardNeal on President Trump’s decision to politicize Administrative Law Judges: “This executive or… This is an incredibly moving tribute that will honor the innocent lives that were lost on #September11.

Hundreds of entrepreneurs, students, job seekers, &amp; small business owners learning about how to improve their workforce skills. https://t.co/5AP3hpwQZr Great to be at the opening of the Pediatric Inpatient Acute Rehabilitation Unit at @SHCSpringfield. We are lucky to have this institution in #MA01. https://t.co/dSuz4WEDgt Wishing everyone a happy and safe #FourthofJuly. As we celebrate our independence, let us take a moment to think about the Founders’ commitment to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I am thrilled to be chosen for this position to ensure the interests of the vital military institutions in #MA01 are held in the highest regard. 
https://t.co/nHaR3fM0QG While temperatures continue to rise, take note of these important safety tips from @NOAA. https://t.co/efRKbA6bWp I am pleased to see that TSA will be extended for #PuertoRico survivors until July 23. This is a welcome outcome that will allow these individuals extended time in their current housing arrangements to figure out their plan of action moving forward. https://t.co/1X0FT9HOvB It was great to visit Rick's Place in #Wilbraham yesterday to learn about the work they do supporting grieving children and their families.

It must be real bipartisan legislation that is crafted and enacted to solve this humanitarian crisis. #FamiliesBelongTogther

https://t.co/wSwRXYyxgN The #SCOTUS ruling against unions in Janus v AFSCME is yet another unprecedented attack on free speech. It is because of unions that we have a 5-day/40-hour work week, affordable health care &amp; great public schools. I will continue to fight for these rights &amp; these great workers. Our Founding Fathers had the foresight to include in the Constitution individuals’ right to due process of law to protect against government abuse and overreach. Denying even one person due process endangers all of our rights and erodes our nation’s founding principles. https://t.co/6PFeDwe7S8 RT @WaysMeansCmte: Ranking Member @RepRichardNeal on @USCBO’s long-term budget outlook:

The Trump Administration's policy is cruel and inhumane. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Pc2CiliDGy How many more families will be traumatized before this cruel &amp; inhumane program is halted? President Trump could stop these forcible separations with one phone call but he continues to play politics with the lives of people seeking asylum in the US https://t.co/gpkrpBYTy1 Happy #FathersDay to all those across #CD1 and the country.
