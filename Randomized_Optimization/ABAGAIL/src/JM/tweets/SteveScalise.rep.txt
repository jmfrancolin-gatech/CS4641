My prayers are with you and your family. https://t.co/19Ng4GonB7 During the next three weeks of this short-term agreement, Pelosi and Schumer need to stop playing partisan games and finally take serious steps to address the humanitarian and safety risks at the southern border while also reaching a long-term agreement on government funding. One thing is clear from this last 35 days: Pelosi and Schumer would rather force the longest government shutdown in our history than fund border security that is critical to the safety of our nation. Yet each time, Pelosi and Schumer refused to come to the table or even present a counteroffer. Now, once again, President Trump is exhibiting leadership by agreeing to re-open even though we still haven’t reached an agreement on border security. Time and time again, President Trump proposed reasonable solutions that would open the government and secure our borders, while also including policies that Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have previously supported. Over the last month, Speaker Pelosi and liberals in Washington have put their personal differences with President Trump over the security of our border and the paychecks of federal workers. Congratulations @PortNOLA on this accomplishment! This growth of trade through NOLA and along the Mississippi is why our work to deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel is critical. https://t.co/8JkZU2mX0a If Democrats are going to reject what experts tell us they need to secure our border, at some point they have to tell the American people what it is they are actually for, and put an offer on the table. Enough. https://t.co/xDEau4Gbm9 Now Democrats are rejecting @realDonaldTrump's offers before he even makes them. Stop the foolishness! The only way to solve this is to actually negotiate with each other. Until Democrats are willing to talk, progress is impossible. https://t.co/B88jeDRZqT Democrats claim to want open negotiations—but after a group of them went to meet with @realDonaldTrump, their own leadership said they weren't authorized to make a deal. It's clear: no Democrat is authorized to make a deal because they'd rather block @POTUS than find solutions. https://t.co/Nx4iGr2JUE Even several of Nancy Pelosi's House Democrats are acknowledging that a physical barrier is necessary to solve the crisis at our southern border. What will it take for Nancy Pelosi to put aside her commitment to obstructing @realDonaldTrump &amp; face reality? We need a border wall. https://t.co/pQejAb878j The reality: Democrats won't put up a dime for a wall that stops criminals &amp; drugs from pouring over our border—but instead passed a bill that sets aside taxpayer money for foreign organizations that provide abortions. They'll fund abortions, but not our security. #priorities https://t.co/muHKkfHSr6 Today House Democrats for the third time voted AGAINST paying federal workers as negotiations continue. I asked the House Democrat Majority Leader a simple question: how can Democrats claim to support workers when they refuse to pay them and instead use them as political pawns? https://t.co/M5wi22XoWb The way out of this shutdown involves Nancy Pelosi putting her personal bias against @realDonaldTrump aside and coming to the table with a serious offer to solve the crisis at our southern border.

Our border is facing a crisis. The time to put our security first is now. https://t.co/RGM2MMkqr6 Joining @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight. Tune in! I’ll be on @foxandfriends soon. Tune in! Hi @AOC. Happy to continue this debate on the Floor of the People’s House, but it’s clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers. #StayClassy https://t.co/lZCO3oiLUZ Everybody wants to be a Cajun. Only a few of us are blessed to be from south Louisiana! #laissezlesbontempsrouler https://t.co/aaWMcliECE RT @RepDanCrenshaw: 3) The belief that because you can't put a wall everywhere (i.e. the Rio Grande), that you should, therefore, put a wal… RT @RepDanCrenshaw: Definition of Border Denialism:

1) The belief that physical barriers can simply be “climbed over”…just like that. 

2)… RT @VP: Productive discussion w/ Congressional leadership staff at @WhiteHouse. @SecNielsen gave a full presentation on crisis along Southe… Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money
Democrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs https://t.co/NxJPSCqvrt Our southern border is in crisis. And we need a wall to solve it. Period. Democrats need to stop playing games with America’s safety and vote to give @realDonaldTrump the tools needed to effectively secure our borders. https://t.co/WlqKNlG6zh RT @RepMarkGreen: I came to Congress to find solutions to the chaos, not create more of it. Comments like this are unhelpful.
https://t.co/… Think about this: Nancy Pelosi passed a bill yesterday that will allow taxpayer money to be given to foreign entities that fund abortions, but she won’t give more taxpayer money to the Department of Homeland Security to effectively secure America’s border. #priorities https://t.co/KWft5oukhW Please join me in praying for these children and their families. This is a heartbreaking tragedy. https://t.co/SmYqO4Goh6 Joining @FoxNews' @AmericaNewsroom soon. Tune in! This is what happens when you work with @realDonaldTrump to get big government out of the way and let hardworking American families and small businesses keep more of their hard-earned money → 312,000 jobs added, vs 176,000 expected; wages rise in blowout jobs report https://t.co/WsEciYPADc RT @SteveScalise: Meet the new House Democrat majority.
https://t.co/XTNZa0hQ0W Meet the new House Democrat majority.
https://t.co/XTNZa0hQ0W 3. Change the rules to allow YOUR taxes to be raised to pay for their big government programs and liberal agenda
4. Sneak a provision into their funding bill that allows taxpayer dollars to fund abortions in foreign countries House Democrats’ Day 1 record:
1. Block vote to stay and work in DC until they open the government and fund our border security 
2. Pass a sham bill to reopen the government that doesn’t include a dime more in funding for the wall Let’s see if the media will report this: On their first day in control of the House, Democrats voted to LEAVE TOWN instead of staying in DC to work to open the government and #BuildTheWall. Once again, they're choosing open borders over an open government. #SchumerShutdown RT @HouseGOP: We’re proud to welcome an incredible group of Republicans to the House GOP Conference. Together, we’ll continue fighting for… .@POTUS has now signed this into law! I’m proud to have helped lead the effort in Congress to recognize Steve Gleason for his incredible service. #ALS https://t.co/JKcCUV6QRt RT @RepTomRice: House Democrats first move in the majority? Make it easier to raise your taxes. You can't make this stuff up folks! https:/… Fun to visit with a few of the new Republican representatives in their offices today! https://t.co/IFkJ8bdMWo RT @WaysandMeansGOP: As one of their first actions leading the House, @HouseDemocrats rejected efforts to make the $2,000 child tax credit… Today I was honored to be sworn in for another term in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was a privilege to have my kids with me in the chamber! I’m excited to continue serving Louisiana’s First District in Congress and fighting for conservative principles as Republican Whip. https://t.co/RNEQmtH6i6 The numbers are alarming. How many convicted criminals and terrorists have to enter our country before Democrats agree to get serious about border security and give @realDonaldTrump the tools he needs to build a wall and keep our communities safe? https://t.co/K6qYTYklLi We need to build the wall and give @realDonaldTrump the tools he needs to secure our border. I’ll join @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight to discuss. It’s time that Democrats stop playing games with the safety of our country. In this new year, let us all resolve to finally pass the funding necessary to secure our border and keep America safe. No more broken promises. No more excuses. https://t.co/2BQV3x2iYJ The time for political games is over. Lives are at stake. Just last week, an illegal immigrant who crossed our southern border murdered police officer Ronil Singh, an immigrant himself. The crime caused by open borders has to stop. We need the wall. https://t.co/2BQV3x2iYJ Wishing you and your family a happy and healthy 2019! #HappyNewYear https://t.co/Uq9EX9fcx1 Since @realDonaldTrump took office, ICE agents have made 235,000+ arrests of illegals with criminal records, yet House Democrats’ latest offer doesn’t fund the President’s request to secure our borders. It’s time for Schumer &amp; Pelosi to fund border security &amp; #KeepAmericaSafe. From DHS: There are nearly 2,100 illegal entries a day at our southern border. Last year alone, 17,000 criminals were apprehended at the border, and DHS prevented 3,755 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United States.
