His threat that he may do it again shows that he caved to pressure, not that he learned from his mistake.

I first introduced this bill in 2014 in response to tragic shooting death of TSA Officer Gerardo I. Hernandez at LAX. It's deeply disappointing that Trump is choosing to withhold disaster assistance, instead of working with our state to address devastating economic &amp; human toll brought by climate change, which has led to longer wildfire seasons that have wreaked havoc on our local communities. Furthermore, while California has committed to a five-year, $1 billion forest management plan and has already invested $111.3 million on forest health since 2017, President Trump’s U.S. Forest Service budget has been cut by more than $2 billion since 2016. Not only is his tweet cruel, but it’s also purposely misleading. Almost 60 percent of forestland in California is overseen by the federal government. It is simply disgraceful that the President is threatening people’s lives and livelihoods by withholding resources that will help Ventura County rebuild from the wildfires that have devastated our community. https://t.co/C7D9bTnTX9 President Trump, and those who support this damaging political stunt, should re-open the government and then sit down like adults to discuss the most effective ways to protect our borders, while passing immigration legislation that reflects our values as a nation. This week, we are trying again, bringing up funding bills that were written and passed overwhelmingly by Senate Republicans, but Senator McConnell has done an about-face and is refusing to move them forward. On day one of the 116th Congress, the House passed legislation that would provide funds for sensible and effective border security measures – not an ineffective wall. But the President refused to sign it or even negotiate. We can — and we must — do more to safeguard our borders while still upholding our long-standing commitments to those fleeing persecution and violence. #TrumpShutdown is causing &gt;37K Californians, including many vets, to go w/o pay, treating hardworking families like political pawns &amp; actually creating more risk at border.
