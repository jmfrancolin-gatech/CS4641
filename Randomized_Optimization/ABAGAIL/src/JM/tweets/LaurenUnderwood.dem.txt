I know what it’s like to live with a pre-existing condition, &amp; ran for #IL14 to protect access to quality, affordable care for the 300,000 people in #IL14 who do too. Proud this week to introduce legislation banning junk insurance plans that  DON'T cover pre-existing conditions. Like #IL14, #CA25 has never been represented by a woman before—which means @KatieHill4CA is making history every day for her district! Going forward, let's make more history &amp; pack these halls of power with new faces, experiences, &amp; worldviews. It's time.

https://t.co/q0bDOTrmtB It's time.

https://t.co/SxR4bAxd6t For me, the #SOTU drove home that our most important problems aren't Democrat or Republican. We need to sit down together to fix our health care, support paid family leave, &amp; give middle-class families a fair shot. Shutting down our government and our dialogue is not an option. In case you were curious about the sea of white, off-white, eggshell, ivory, and other similar colors you saw at the #SOTU last night...

https://t.co/7SqJMi6e8Q You can count on it, @PPIAction! And here's what will expand our choices even more: #paidfamilyleave, affordable #childcare, and other policies that empower people to balance their work and their relationships and to pursue opportunities to the fullest. #ItsTime https://t.co/RGPf5vjVUy I'm proud to stand for choice. I'm proud to stand for women's rights to shape their families and their lives. Proud to stand with @PPFA, @NARAL, @VoteProChoice, and other organizations that fight for these choices every day. /end An agenda that demonizes women for making their own healthcare choices, and fails to provide affordable childcare, equal pay, adequate family leave, or affordable healthcare as a defense against life's catastrophes, can't be said to be empowering to women. /2 In tonight's #SOTU, the president gave lip service to empowering women &amp; cherishing life. Yet his words on reproductive health spoke to a different agenda. As a nurse committed to uplifting women &amp; families in #IL14 &amp; across our nation, I won't let those words slide. /1 I think that somebody's gotta be you, Erin. (Or a friend. #nopressure) https://t.co/QuWnWbLxcd RT @PPIAction: Love seeing @LaurenUnderwood, the youngest African American woman elected to Congress AND a nurse, on @msnbc talking about h… Grateful to Stacey Abrams for an inspiring response tonight. Thanks for lighting the path forward. #AbramsAddress #TeamUnderwood, I'll be on @MSNBC at 8:15PM tonight right before the #SOTU—be sure to tune in! Proud to represent #IL14 and watch the #SOTU as a member of a Congress featuring an historic number of women, millennials, and people of color. We are ready to make our contribution to a more perfect union. 🇺🇸 Illness or accident can strike any time, no matter our age, background, situation in life. Affordable insurance coverage is critical for all. Grateful to my colleague @Gwen4Congress for sharing her battle &amp; raising awareness of the need for protection against life's ambushes. https://t.co/xNSr0RE3FV The bitter cold we saw this week is the result of climate change—&amp; severe weather will intensify in coming years. On the Homeland Security committee, I'll be using my expertise in public health &amp; disaster response to make sure #IL14 &amp; our country can face for whatever's in store. Protecting coverage for our pre-existing conditions is the reason I ran for Congress. We will not back down.

https://t.co/6fj4XPFRKi In 1992, #IL14's Woodstock did its best impression of Punxsutawney, PA, by serving as the set for the #GroundhogDay film. Over 25 years later later we rallied in that same town square (but thankfully didn't get stuck in a time loop). Learn more: 
https://t.co/A0RcGKAl2O https://t.co/N0HC6ckG1R Fun fact: Our state is fielding our highest number of women in the U.S. House. Ever. 

https://t.co/6f3V7rH85H I was proud to vote YES this week on House Resolution 79: "Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that government shutdowns are detrimental to the nation and should not occur."

https://t.co/ewiXTXkBQp Health care. Reproductive rights. Paid family leave. Equal pay. Affordable childcare. These aren't Democratic or Republican, male or female issues. They're human issues. We're ready to bring humanity back to government. 
 https://t.co/O6iCyZ9cSI Unbought. Unbossed. Today, the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth, I'd like to send a little love to two heroines—one from our past, Shirley Chisholm, and one from our present. See you Tuesday, Ms. Abrams. https://t.co/AqRBMtJGgz Honored by this lovely profile, but even more exciting: it contains tips if you're a #nurse planning on running for Congress!  👩🏾‍⚕️👨🏼‍⚕️👩🏽‍⚕️

https://t.co/nkcuHu8qZd Co-signed, 
Congresswoman Underwood https://t.co/PjsZqi46Nu The outbreak in the Pacific Northwest is alarming. Take it from a nurse: vaccinations work. Herd immunity protects those who clinically *shouldn't* be vaccinated, like children undergoing chemotherapy. #IL14 (&amp; everyone reading), pls vaccinate.

https://t.co/dVM2COL54d To borrow the nickname I used for my campaign team: Public Works staff are the true Legends of the Fox Valley! Thank you, thank you, thank you for your tireless work in this bitter cold. 

https://t.co/1YLsGDr45J Prepping for month 2! Proud to represent &amp; connect with folks of #IL14 &amp; fight for you in Washington. Onward. https://t.co/mntQb1ufWd I like normal. 

https://t.co/sEX1cUBqOt Excited to serve alongside @HaleyLive on Education and Labor (including the subcommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) AND receive her dispatches from the Space/Science/Technology Cmte! 🚀🔭🌙🌎👾👩🏾‍🚀 https://t.co/PaHjLxDSkI Checking in, #IL14! I've co-sponsored 8 pieces of legislation so far, tackling issues from gun safety to election reform, but one near and dear to my heart is H.R. 728, a bipartisan proposal to fund loans, scholarships, &amp; grants to train the next generation of nurses.  👩🏾‍⚕️👨🏼‍⚕️👩🏽‍⚕️👨🏾‍⚕️👩🏻‍⚕️ This week marks the 10th anniversary of the signature of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Today, I'm proud to support the #PaycheckFairness Act to bring women in #IL14 and across our country one step closer to equal pay for equal work. What are your stories of pay disparity? Even my coat needs a coat this winter. (I swear neither I nor anyone on my staff runs Coat Twitter!) Seriously—stay warm out there, #IL14 and everyone in the path of this week's deep freeze (the lovely byproduct of a warming Arctic, by the way). ❄🌨🧤 https://t.co/8kqaobgIHg Three. Billion. Dollars.

We're not doing this again. Not on my watch. #IL14

https://t.co/IBD8e9CQvO Parents of #IL14! @Fermilab is a vital driver of STEM innovation in our district—don't miss this chance to get the little ones interested.

https://t.co/NTg24SPV0T Today, the House will hold multiple hearings on drug pricing and the importance of protecting coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

https://t.co/Fmmc1YCxcM McHenry County, it's time to nominate the amazing women in your lives to be honored as 2019 Women of Distinction! #IL14
 
https://t.co/GCMadwI05O The deal to reopen the gov't for 3 weeks came after my colleagues and I voted almost a dozen times to make it happen—and it comes with threats to shut down gov't *again* on Feb 15. These reckless games hurt families across #IL14 and our country and they need to stop. @NastyJ49 @Blavity 😊👩🏾‍⚕️ A nurse, a pediatrician, a biochemist, a dentist, a couple doctors, and a whole lotta engineers walk into the #116thCongress...(the punchline: progress)

https://t.co/FrtLHz4E91 #IL14, this week I learned my House committee assignments: Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Education and Labor (which encompasses health care). Your voice is here with me in Washington—please speak up with your stories and your priorities in each of these areas! 😂😂😂😂😂that the green coat has a life and mind of its own (though not its own office on Capitol Hill)! 

https://t.co/5GhlROJLaE Let's #EndTheShutdown. Last weekend, I heard from federal employees across agencies at 2 roundtables &amp; a rally. Their commitment to the public's safety &amp; security and the sacrifices they're making are profound. I'll keep voting to restore order &amp; fully fund the government. https://t.co/VSWJaMZQ5K Had a wonderful time in #IL14 last weekend for the Fox Valley Women's March. I was honored to tour a local domestic violence shelter hurt by the shutdown since the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is in limbo. #EndTheShutdownNow https://t.co/I3pX8WocbS RT @brittamckenna: I love being represented by strong women like @RepUnderwood and @lindachapalavia who inspire us all to turn complacency… Healthy, empowered families make for a healthy nation. #IL14, you elected me to fight for our health care in Congress, &amp; today, on the 46th anniversary of the #RoevWade decision, I stand by my commitment to fight for the full spectrum of family planning options for all Americans. “Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle."  An important reminder for these times. Today, let's renew our commitment to building an America that brings Dr. King's dreams to fruition. #MLKDay RT @sbressnerKCC: Approximately 500 people attended the Fox Valley Women’s March in Geneva. #foxvalleywomensmarch #geneva https://t.co/JRHP… RT @lenihoppenworth: With you in solidarity Fox Valley Women’s March! ✊@kcc_il @LaurenUnderwood @SeanCasten @Sania_Irwin https://t.co/uaVIU… RT @theTeedge: Three inches of snow, below freezing temperatures, and hundreds of people are still showing up to the Fox Valley Women’s Mar… RT @barbara_isabel: The snow storm won’t stop us from marching for women rights! — attending Fox Valley Women's March, Geneva at Old Kane C… I'll be there—will you be marching with us? https://t.co/9wNoA1qKxa Thank you @nytimes for the powerful photo story highlighting the women of the #116thCongress! I’m honored to work with these incredible women every day in service to #IL14 and the American people. We're just getting started. https://t.co/LCjTXL1kGb https://t.co/IO2HRrAaeT The government shutdown is deeply impacting #IL14. Last weekend I visited the Crystal Lake Food Pantry &amp; learned more about the special resources available for furloughed federal employees in McHenry County. Note: the pantry needs some essential staples like flour, sugar, &amp; oil. https://t.co/oCsPzxeqZS We represent the people, and we will fight for the people. We will not back down. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/QNemG2yc7a We will not back down. #EndtheShutdown

https://t.co/VsIicsXyUQ Proud to vote to restore back pay for federal employees who've been furloughed or required to work since the shutdown began on December 22. I will continue to stand by hardworking Americans in #IL14 and across the country who deserve full and fair compensation for their service. A message for @senatemajldr McConnell: #IL14 families need you to end this shutdown. Now.

https://t.co/LTNl46APy2 Such a joy to fight for our priorities in this diverse, hardworking #116thCongress! We stand as thousands, @AyannaPressley! https://t.co/wm8JF3nAai #ShutdownStories #IL14 https://t.co/38yjeLZRR2 I know the impact of a shutdown—back in 2013 during my time at @HHSgov, I was furloughed for about three weeks without pay. It's 2019 and we're now in the 25th day of the longest government shutdown in history. How has it affected you, #IL14? Share your #ShutdownStories here. Thrilled to be part of the legacy of the Women’s March and so proud of the activists, candidates and new lawmakers highlighted by @dailyherald.  Looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday at the Women’s March Fox Valley in Geneva! https://t.co/eFh8JPLzVQ Delightful breakfast this weekend with Victor Swanson at Limestone Coffee &amp; Tea in Batavia. Such a treat to meet the co-owners Joy and Leah! https://t.co/X84WjiEfHh Passing H.R. 1 is essential to pursuing our other priorities—the overarching goals that will ensure stability &amp; safety for our families here in northern Illinois. On your behalf, #IL14, I'm proud to stand with my colleagues in support of this bill.  

https://t.co/h634fUcqvl Thanks to all who joined us for our day of service with @mchenrydems yesterday. For more on how to support Lauren in Congress, join our mailing list at https://t.co/NNhsbzugAa and follow us at https://t.co/ToP3FbdTj5! Final call, #TeamUnderwood: Lauren’s back on the ground in #IL14 this weekend, so join her and @mchenrydems today for a day of service in Crystal Lake!

https://t.co/rYkLFs6yln #TeamUnderwood: I’m back this weekend to pitch in for #IL14 right here on the ground. Join me and @mchenrydems tomorrow for a day of service in Crystal Lake! 

https://t.co/rYkLFrOWWN Our diversity is our strength. So honored to work for the people and serve in this #116thCongress! https://t.co/MukPl9Ugcm Behind the scenes of my transition to Congress and our first day in office. Proud to serve #IL14! https://t.co/KiSETaWasW Our farmers, parks &amp; courtroom employees, workers for @EPA, @TSA, @IRSnews, &amp; more—all bearing the brunt of this reckless shutdown. Families, businesses, &amp; communities are hurting. I join colleagues on both sides of the aisle to say: this must end. 

https://t.co/s1VfSsFhEZ Thanks Reniya! Hopefully I won't be the youngest for long 😉 https://t.co/14lmnkk50r #IL14, you elected me—a nurse w/a pre-existing condition—to use my voice &amp; my vote to protect our access to health care. This morning, I proudly used my voice on the House floor &amp; committed my vote to fight the GOP's lawsuit against the #ACA. We will not back down in this fight. Eight years ago today, then-Rep. @GabbyGiffords survived a shooting that nearly took her life—but she persisted. Today, I'm proud to join a bipartisan group of colleagues in the House in supporting universal background checks. It's time.

https://t.co/mH4FSctYCy We're underway! I was proud to get to work on Day 1 by making sure the new norms for the #116thCongress included the strongest guidelines yet to combat workplace harassment &amp; make it easier for survivors of harassment and discrimination to come forward. 

https://t.co/Ysz3oL70rB We need leaders with diverse experiences &amp; skill sets—nurses, doctors, teachers, scientists, artists, caregivers, entrepreneurs, tradeswomen—at all levels of gov't. Our experiences echo those of the majority of Americans; we should shape the policies that shape our country. https://t.co/GSZxqZ0hqO We are already hard at work for the families across #IL14, be sure to follow us at @RepUnderwood! Proud of all we've accomplished—and thinking of the young women of the future who'll be stepping forward to serve in the coming years. A greater change is on the way.

https://t.co/wvWzuQ6oNk Here we go, #IL14! https://t.co/OGsq2OBONc New Congress, new name! For your bookmarks: our campaign handle is now updated as  @LaurenUnderwood. #TBT to 2006 and life as an intern for @BarackObama: https://t.co/iSp4X1dVuu

A lot can change in 12 years: today, I'm back to be sworn into the U.S. House for #IL14. Tune in  at 12 ET today at https://t.co/fuMdM5U9oc and help ring in the 116th Congress! https://t.co/yfjxB4qvcl Moving into my office today and answered my first constituent call from #IL14. Thanks for calling Brent from Montgomery! https://t.co/VtRhZnjvBK #HappyNewYear! Time for new beginnings and a new direction for #IL14 and our country. https://t.co/geup7rzF65 Thanks to all for your hard work in 2018 -- your commitment and perseverance have laid the foundation for a 2019 full of progress for #IL14, our state and our nation. How are you ringing out 2018 tonight? Four days til showtime, #IL14! I'm busy gearing up for the great work we're going to do in the New Year, including making sure every voter of every party has their say in our democracy (it doesn't get much more patriotic than that). And that's just the start. Counting down now... One week from today, Lauren will be sworn in as the next representative for# #IL14—the first-ever woman, person of color, &amp; registered nurse to serve in that role. Fighting for our district will take resources—can you chip in to our Inaugural Fund now?

https://t.co/MCBk2xctvV @CSDeVore Omg! Chris, this is my first time seeing it 😍 thank you. I’m so grateful to be working on our behalf in Washington, but I do love coming home--to my family &amp; to the community that believed in me &amp; fought for me to become our fighter in Congress. You fought for me, &amp; now I’m ready to fight for you with every vote. Happy holidays, #IL14! https://t.co/eDxPCP5yOs As I prepare for swearing-in next week, I'm remembering that 2018 was, beyond doubt, the "health care election." In DC, I'll do what #IL14 elected me to do: protect fellow Americans with pre-existing conditions &amp; work to make coverage &amp; prescriptions affordable for our families. There's so much work to do in Washington to serve the needs of our families—and it CAN be done in a bipartisan way. This shutdown accomplishes nothing, delays our progress, and leaves Americans in limbo on the cusp of the holidays. Beyond exasperated to see these games played. #TeamUnderwood, as the holidays loom, let's get rested  for the work ahead &amp; remember: fighting for our priorities WILL take sticking together &amp; growing our team. Make sure you're tuned in here &amp; at https://t.co/6eX3IDFQhR, &amp; sign up for email updates at https://t.co/3cgUG1zW6o!

Ready to run? 

https://t.co/7mSpgJKGty Our full statement on last night's court ruling against the ACA: https://t.co/KKUfrljy6Q Fortunately, the court's decision does NOT affect open enrollment for 2019, and I encourage all Americans who need coverage to #GetCovered at https://t.co/9dZx4UYL8J before tonight's deadline. Appalled by this court decision jeopardizing the health care protections people in IL-14 &amp; across the country depend on—including those, like myself, who live with pre-existing conditions. In Congress, I'll work with my colleagues to strengthen the ACA. 

https://t.co/JbY7Ydzo5m Proud to join the Illinois delegation today to raise awareness about Saturday's deadline for 2019 ACA enrollment. Tomorrow is the last day to #GetCovered! #EnrollbyDec15 https://t.co/CSnEeW03tf Today marks 10 months since the Parkland shooting and 6 years since the shooting at Sandy Hook. It's time to bring clear eyes and scientific thinking to tackling what is both an ongoing human tragedy and a public health disaster. We're ready. 

https://t.co/g2g2gSle6S Every day, a new disappointment. We must rejoin the #ParisAgreement and fulfill our obligations to the international community and to our planet. Time is running out.

In the meantime, there's less than a week to #GetCovered—spread the word and #EnrollbyDec15 https://t.co/svWF4FA59S https://t.co/7Oa6memipN I'm proud of the priorities we're putting forward, &amp; look forward to supporting them alongside the needs of #IL14—including the urgent need to stabilize our health care system. Be heard: What do you want to see Congress tackle in 2019? 

https://t.co/DBvSMCLYki We, the people, have spoken. 

https://t.co/oVW5p9nxOE One illness can change a family's entire trajectory—and no one should have to crowdfund to pay medical bills. We need to build a health care system that can cushion the impact of diseases like ALS on ordinary families. 

https://t.co/0ITAKMwiLM There are just 10 days left to #GetCovered—take care of it today! https://t.co/nNVENO2Fn8 RT @MikeLevinCA: I am profoundly honored to be a part of this spectacular freshman class in the 116th Congress! https://t.co/pMWPhUiT1X Honored to serve in Congress with this incredible group of women.

Not because Lauren shares her party label, but because Lauren shares her values. 5. I told her, “This is my soccer game—the only difference is that my playing field is a little bigger.” As I said it, I felt our hearts connecting over something greater than party—over common values. We were 2 mothers, doing our best to help our children thrive, rain or shine. 4. It turned out she was Republican, so she couldn’t sign my petition, but she invited me in &amp; we talked. She commented on my being out collecting signatures on such an awful day. I pointed out that she had just been enduring the same weather out on the soccer field with her son. 3. A quick story to drive home that point: Almost one year ago, on a cold, rainy, wretched November day, I was out collecting signatures to help Lauren get on the ballot. I knocked on the door of a woman who told me she had just returned from her young son’s outdoor soccer game. 2. Seriously—don’t miss your chance to cast a vote today. Today represents such an incredible opportunity to bridge partisan divides and reconnect over what really matters to all of us, Democrat, Republican, or other: the well-being of our families and the future of our children. #TeamUnderwood, surprise!
