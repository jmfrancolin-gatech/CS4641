As a proud Cub Scout mom, I‚Äôm excited to wish a happy 109th birthday to the @boyscouts! #ScoutMeIn https://t.co/tg4QQKlRri Our veterans should never have to miss a medical appointment because they can‚Äôt find affordable child care. Today I voted to pass H.R. 840, the Veterans‚Äô Access to Child Care Act, to make sure they can attend their appointments and get the care they‚Äôve earned. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/qwwQ3mfuaB As I go forward as a Congressmember, I will keep John‚Äôs commitment to improving the lives of everyday Americans as a guidepost for our work. (3/3) Rep. @JohnDingell inspired generations of lawmakers to fight for healthcare and our environment. Today, millions of older Americans have quality, affordable healthcare because he championed Medicare. (2/3) To my friend and mentor @RepDebDingell, I continue to send prayers upon learning that her husband passed away. (1/3) Happening now! https://t.co/ZNNFqUz9ja In less than an hour, I‚Äôll be taking to the House floor to talk about the need for gun violence prevention to make our communities safer. Tune in on @CSPAN or watch online here: https://t.co/Fl3R52GEZr I‚Äôm standing with my colleagues today to #EndRxMonopolyPrices. When it comes to Medicare, we should stop handcuffing older Americans with higher prescription drug prices to protect the profits of Big Pharma. https://t.co/m1X3kFD3N4 The @CFPB‚Äôs decision to roll back rules for the payday lending industry is just the latest sign of the Trump Administration putting corporate profits ahead of protecting American families from abusive practices. #CultureOfCorruption https://t.co/HZctbJaxcd It‚Äôs no secret why the payday lobby spends lavishly at Trump properties. It pays off when Trump‚Äôs @CFPB sides with loan sharks over consumers. .@MickMulvaney once said ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn‚Äôt talk to you. If you‚Äôre a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure the payday lending lobby is happy they gave him so much money when he was in Congress. https://t.co/8qoxzodGF6 Today, the Trump @CFPB tossed out a rule to protect consumers from scam loans from payday lenders. In some states, interest rates can be over 700%. #StopTheDebtTrap https://t.co/p2PoswKHmy This one of the reasons I‚Äôm supporting #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act. We need to keep our kids safe, no matter where they are in the country. https://t.co/OVbYJeSCiL Let‚Äôs get this straight - Wall Street banks got a $21 billion windfall from the #GOPTaxScam while many middle-class Orange County families will see their taxes go up this year? Outrageous! https://t.co/qArdDFZkU2 Happy to see my friend @RichCordray and have the opportunity to talk about how @FSCDems can protect consumers from shady lenders and continue his work @CFPB! https://t.co/DBmlwLmB5W The President just announced the next Summit w/ North Korea will be in Vietnam. I urge him to press for a speedy, fair, &amp; transparent resolution for Michael Nguyen--an American citizen held in Vietnam w/o charges for 7 months. We need to #BringMichaelHome. https://t.co/UQUw5m0ezn I‚Äôm bringing my constituent Helen Nguyen to #SOTU. Her husband Michael‚Äîan American citizen‚Äîhas been detained in Vietnam without charge for nearly 7 months. It‚Äôs time to #BringMichaelHome to his family in Orange County. https://t.co/q5ORc28XL5 And for some trivia on why it‚Äôs suffragist, not suffragette, read more here: https://t.co/EZhpyNXiW9 Today I‚Äôm joining my @HouseDemWomen colleagues in wearing suffragist white to honor the women who paved the way for a more equal society. https://t.co/bSiwfNzCuc Happy #YearOfThePig! https://t.co/BbPzPSWM5f As a working mom of 3, I know how important these protections are. Everyone deserves job-protected medical leave - and I‚Äôll be in Congress making sure we do better. https://t.co/vbQcyTZC2f 26 years after the #FMLA was passed, 200 million Americans have taken unpaid time off to recover from a serious illness or care for new babies or sick relatives. But millions still don‚Äôt qualify for leave or can‚Äôt afford it. Rosa Parks was born #OnThisDay in 1913. When she said no on that Montgomery bus, she showed immense courage and challenged the system of racial discrimination. I‚Äôm proud to honor her legacy as part of #BlackHistoryMonth. It took us some time to secure a location and sign a lease, but we are so excited to move into our new office space today! Stay tuned for information about our open house and how to visit us! #CA45 üçä https://t.co/Cosn3o2BE7 Wishing a big victory to SoCal‚Äôs new team! Go Rams! üèà #SuperBowlLIII As we head into the Year of the Pig, I hope that all those celebrating will enjoy a festive Lunar New Year with family and friends. I wish everyone prosperity and good health in the year ahead. https://t.co/M4190UlGXn I fought for my seat on @FSCDems to make sure what happened in 2008 never happens again. There will be aggressive oversight if Otting tries to undo the work we‚Äôve done so far (much more left to do) to make homes affordable for ALL Americans. Buying a home is the largest purchase most Americans will make in their lives. If we ever want to live in a country where equality is more than just a concept, it is critical that we enforce fair mortgage lending terms. The same Joseph Otting who *before* he was appointed claimed he does not believe discrimination exists in America. Remember this? https://t.co/8IDqyZuQbM Joseph Otting was appointed by @realDonaldTrump to head the @USOCC: the agency responsible for policing discriminatory lending practices. He just gave @citibank a free pass on discriminating against people of color. https://t.co/RXe4e6C8LU 4 in 10 moms are the sole or primary breadwinner for their families. As a single mom of 3 young kids, I know how important #EqualPay is for working women. I'm proud to join my House colleagues to introduce the #PaycheckFairness Act. Congratulations to the students of Uni High on a well-deserved win! I can‚Äôt wait to cheer you on as you head to the #NSB2019 National Finals in April. https://t.co/Hd8D1J7lDc It‚Äôs been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law, but we still haven‚Äôt achieved pay equity. Today I joined my colleagues in supporting the #PaycheckFairness Act, because #EqualPay isn‚Äôt just crucial to building a stronger economy‚Äîit‚Äôs the right thing to do. https://t.co/It6gFJRtij .@goOCTA also talked to us about its public transit efforts and investment in cycling--including $4.3 million set aside each year for bicycle projects. I'm excited to collaborate on these important projects as well. Wonderful and productive meeting with @RepMikeLevin and @goOCTA to talk about how we can make transit better for Orange County families. I‚Äôm looking forward to partnering with them to work on reducing congestion and improving roads. https://t.co/hnz6CmN2p4 I‚Äôm excited to announce that I‚Äôll be serving on the @FSCDems subcommittees responsible for consumer protection and investor protection. With these positions, I‚Äôll be fighting to make sure our economy works to create prosperity and opportunity for all American families. https://t.co/LUwFDIdwAJ Great meeting with @ACCOC today to talk about how we can work together to tackle homelessness, infrastructure, and other issues facing Orange County residents. If an issue is important to #CA45 families, it‚Äôs important to me. https://t.co/JK2xMla6AN According to the nonpartisan @USCBO, the #TrumpShutdown cost us $3 billion in permanently lost economic activity. The facts are clear‚Äîthe shutdown was bad for federal workers and bad for our economy. Now that the government is open, it has to stay open. On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we hold in our hearts millions whose lives were taken and millions more who were displaced. We must commit ourselves, today and every day, to stand united in the fight against hatred and to build a future of equality and justice for all. #WeRemember I‚Äôm fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful colleagues at @UCIrvine like @drhhardt. As I work to keep #CA45 families safe, I‚Äôll be having conversations with Dr. Hardt and others to stay up-to-date on the important role NATO plays in our national security.
https://t.co/c18ZFBhb5s Read my statement on the end of the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/3uvUnry257 RT @RepKatiePorter: At my town hall last night, community members told me they‚Äôre worried about how the shutdown is hurting their families.‚Ä¶ What a #TBT. Since I gave this speech, the #TrumpShutdown became the longest shutdown in our nation‚Äôs history, and I voted six more times to reopen the government. It‚Äôs now Day 34, and it‚Äôs past time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/DAFxgWSklv I‚Äôm so happy that @UCILaw student Sam is able to join us for a fellowship in our congressional office. We were so happy to host him after the government shutdown stopped him from interning at the @FTC. https://t.co/kmlaWAp48E If Secretary Ross read my report about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting #CA45 families, he would know that almost 2/3 of furloughed employees don‚Äôt have enough in savings to pay their living expenses for longer than 14 days. 
READ my report &gt;&gt; https://t.co/N1uZU4tQaO https://t.co/NwibBCoNoz At my town hall last night, community members told me they‚Äôre worried about how the shutdown is hurting their families. I listened, and today I'm back in Washington and cast my 10th vote to reopen the government. WATCH from @ABC7 &gt;&gt; https://t.co/M1hbuAxdoG I fought for a seat on @FSCDems because one of my top priorities is protecting American families from financial tricks that trap consumers in a cycle of debt. If the CFPB won‚Äôt do its job, California will, and I‚Äôll stand by them on the Committee. https://t.co/92gIU0mZoF Financial Services Committee new Member orientation! Excited to get started. https://t.co/bMBDuuQvAP Today marks one month since the #TrumpShutdown left 800,000 federal workers without paychecks. I heard from #CA45 families hurt by the shutdown at my first official town hall tonight‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to take their voices with me to Washington as I fight to reopen the government. https://t.co/JmnLgMpI4O The Supreme Court decided Roe #OnThisDay in 1973 and affirmed that women have a right to control their own bodies. Reproductive justice is essential to gender equality; ensuring that working women can have kids if and when they want is a human right‚Äîand an economic imperative. Today I proudly volunteered at the @OC_FoodBank to give back on #MLK #DayOfService. In Congress, I‚Äôm committed to upholding the ideals of justice and equality that Dr. King stood for. https://t.co/n1njE97OK7 I have a message for every American hurt in any way by this shutdown. WATCH: https://t.co/9zmErwnZHk Thank you @SecondHarvestFB for helping OC families in need. https://t.co/h2TVCHBQ7u I was so excited to see the energy at today‚Äôs Orange County Women‚Äôs March! I‚Äôm ready to take this inspiration back to Washington to work for OC families! https://t.co/d5uuBVu22z I was on @CNN this morning talking about the need to end the shutdown and get our government back to work. We need effective and comprehensive border security solutions for the 21st century. https://t.co/3L700LwsKM I‚Äôll be at the Women‚Äôs March tomorrow in Santa Ana‚Äîexcited to see everyone there! My first congressional #CA45TownHall is next week, and I want to hear from you about the shutdown and the other issues that matter to you and your family. RSVP here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/5pEDQOeIvU @AFGE1260 President Bobby Orozco is right. This shutdown has to end, and our TSA officers need their paychecks. I‚Äôve voted for every bill in the House to reopen the government, and I continue to stand with the hardworking OC federal workers harmed by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/atV0Qh0QcO As a mom, I entrust public schoolteachers with my 3 kids. As a mom of 2 very active boys, I‚Äôm especially grateful for school nurses and understand the necessity of having nursing staff in every school. I stand with LA teachers in their fight to put students first. #UTLAStrikeDay4 https://t.co/FFAsWIsD3c I‚Äôm excited to announce my appointment to the House Financial Services Committee. From bringing accountability to the big banks to promoting affordable homeownership, I‚Äôm ready to work on some of the most important issues for the people of #CA45. https://t.co/0DnLksWiqh I just voted to invest $12.1 billion in recovery for Americans devastated by natural disasters. After the wildfires we‚Äôve seen, Californians need to know that the federal government will stand with them if a disaster occurs‚ÄîI‚Äôll be in Congress fighting to make sure that happens. I'm continuing to meet with bank representatives to advocate for #CA45 workers hurt by the shutdown. If you need late fees waived or repayment timelines extended, ask your lender. Here's a list of #ShutdownHelp offerings by CA credit unions: https://t.co/MvewLCqhFG https://t.co/7cyxOPvTub Melinda has been working for a government agency for over 30 years. She‚Äôs debating taking out a loan and researching whether she can file for unemployment. She just paid the tuition for one of her kids at college, so she doesn‚Äôt have the means to go without a paycheck. https://t.co/Im2cwiYuRc Aubrey‚Äôs family has filed paperwork to borrow against their 401(k). Borrowing against her 401(k) will come with large tax penalties, but she‚Äôs part of a single-income household living on a federal government wage. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/mJuhBfDgHs Last week, I gave my first speech on the House floor and told the stories of #CA45 families that have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. It‚Äôs time the President stop playing politics with their lives and get these folks their paychecks. (thread) Last week, I sent letters to several of the country‚Äôs largest financial institutions, asking them to help families affected by the #TrumpShutdown. Blameless federal workers should not bear the cost of the President‚Äôs refusal to fund the government. Read the letter &gt;&gt; https://t.co/hVnjT3rAR8 From FDA inspectors to TSA officers, federal employees working to keep us safe are struggling to pay their bills. It‚Äôs Day 25. It‚Äôs past time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/Gz9MuklwxI https://t.co/HDfL69QtTO My heart is sick to hear of the loss of Noah Domingo‚Äîa bright freshman at @UCIrvine. As a mom, I can‚Äôt imagine the immense sadness his parents are feeling. I know the staff at UCI and @OCSheriff are working hard to provide answers &amp; support to loved ones in this difficult time. https://t.co/bLLZ3ZNQ3Z I‚Äôm honored to be part of the largest and most diverse class of women in Congress‚Äîincluding my fellow freshmen moms @RepKimSchrier, @RepSpanberger, @RepSherrill, @RepRashida, @RepLoriTrahan, and @RepPressley‚Äîand ready to work with them to deliver results for OC families. https://t.co/FyPPHI8hMP And thanks to photographer Jeff Brown! I‚Äôm thrilled to join a historic class of freshmen that reflects and represents the diverse communities that make our district and our country strong. See more in @TIME and follow me here on Twitter to see how I‚Äôm fighting for change in Congress.

RSVP and more information &gt;&gt; https://t.co/X24lLxFQZi https://t.co/18Up8RBO06 Happening now! Tune in to hear me talk about the shutdown, how families are hurting, and what could help. https://t.co/WMQznzbFZx üö®üö® Tomorrow is the first paycheck federal workers will miss because of the #TrumpShutdown. üö®üö®
   
I‚Äôll be giving my first speech on the House floor today, talking about affected OC families and calling for relief. TUNE IN (I start in the next hour) &gt;&gt; https://t.co/jqEH3Lp9j1 Over 40,000 Californians are furloughed or working without pay because of the #TrumpShutdown. Some have resorted to borrowing from retirement accounts or GoFundMe accounts or missing loan payments. That‚Äôs unacceptable. #EndTheShutdown #GetGovtGoing
https://t.co/0GqMDqs4PH Our TSA officers are working without pay‚Äîincluding mandatory overtime‚Äîbecause of the #TrumpShutdown. That‚Äôs not good security, and puts all Americans at risk. #EndTheShutdown RT @RepAndyLevin: To mark Day 17 of the senseless #TrumpShutdown, @RepKatiePorter from #CA45 joins me to explain the devastating impact it'‚Ä¶ I was thrilled to have my kids for my first week in DC, but it also helped me reflect again on the challenges of balancing work and being a mom. As I told @politico, work-life balance is not like perfectly balanced scales‚Äîit‚Äôs balance like riding a bike; just keep moving forward! https://t.co/ubppZgh24r Last Friday, I joined @HouseDemocrats in introducing #HR1 to reduce the influence of big money on Congress. With Washington working again for Orange County families instead of special interests, we can act on:
‚úÖ healthcare,
‚úÖ clean energy,
‚úÖ gun violence prevention,
and more. My thoughts are with the victims of last night‚Äôs shooting in Torrance and their families. One of the first things I did after being elected was join the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, because we must do more to prevent tragedies like this. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/d04E7FDirh Yesterday, I was sworn in to represent #CA45, with my kids at my side. I‚Äôm ready to get Washington working better for OC families. Follow here to see how I‚Äôm fighting for healthcare, campaign finance reform, clean energy, and gun violence prevention #ForThePeople. https://t.co/w6mNFkYiRN
