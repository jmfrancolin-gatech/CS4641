Thanks Lisa. This is an issue of economic fairness that both sides of the aisle should support &amp; get signed into law. Women should have the power &amp; freedom to live the lives they want to lead &amp; make decisions for themselves. &amp; women don‚Äôt need the government looking over their shoulder in the examination room, telling them what they can &amp; can‚Äôt do with their own bodies.

Retweet if you agree. 2018 was one of the HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD &amp; climate change will keep threatening our economy &amp; future if we don‚Äôt find ways to ‚Üì our nation‚Äôs carbon footprint.

Here‚Äôs one from a Minnesota air traffic controller. Unbelievable. https://t.co/6klbKp8qgH ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, the impact on these lower-wage workers, folks that are making $20, $22 an hour‚Äîas one woman said to me, ‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt get paid, I don‚Äôt pay my bills‚Äô‚Äîseems to be the most urgent issue and also, in my mind, just basic fairness.‚Äù
https://t.co/BW4ND0fi50 RT @unionadvocate: Some 5,470 federal employees in MN are furloughed by the shutdown or working without pay. This morning @SenTinaSmith is‚Ä¶ Glad we‚Äôre working together on this bipartisan effort, Senator @JerryMoran. https://t.co/gS6pfYp57I I‚Äôm at @mspairport to update folks on the latest shutdown news, and hear Minnesota federal workers describe their shutdown experiences. Their stories are worth a listen. Watch live: https://t.co/d1R6XJf5wz Today 800,000 federal workers aren‚Äôt receiving a paycheck because of Trump‚Äôs shutdown, including 1000s of Minnesotans. In an hour, I‚Äôll be with Minnesota federal workers at @mspairport to hear their #shutdownstories. I‚Äôll be streaming the event live so you can listen, too. @StribGuy @stribrooks Ha! This makes me wonder if other reporters call me from parking lots. Thanks for connecting, @stribrooks. Always a pleasure. It‚Äôs day 20 of Trump‚Äôs shutdown. The longer it lasts, the more critical it is to secure back pay for federal contractor workers. I‚Äôm working on a bill to make sure this happens bc they haven't received back pay after past shutdowns. Pressing the Trump Admin to back this idea too. https://t.co/hQomN1UpkL I want to share a letter I read on the Senate floor today. It‚Äôs not long, so I encourage you to read the whole thing. Read here: https://t.co/hDJFwOwXEL

#ShutdownStories https://t.co/PmM16E5eLY Like I‚Äôve said before: Moms need to work, and babies need to eat. As we work towards creating economic opportunity for all, we cannot neglect breastfeeding working moms. Every workplace should be family-friendly. https://t.co/8WZLqhmEWe Minnesota‚Äîthe state of innovation. We invented the pacemaker, waterskiing, the Honeycrisp apple, and thanks to this Minnesotan, the Clitherall palm tree. https://t.co/RbI4oDPpcu When Minnesota air traffic controllers came to my office this week, they brought dozens of handwritten letters from their colleagues, explaining how Trump‚Äôs shutdown is hurting them. I‚Äôm taking to the Senate floor to share some of their stories. WATCH LIVE:https://t.co/dRv0l4jiFM https://t.co/TN2SYflwlL @toreyvanoot Glad you‚Äôre all caught up! Moose says hello. As someone who has been involved in a lot of negotiations‚ÄîI can tell you this: walking out of a meeting gets you nowhere. Mr. President, walking out is no way to end your government shutdown. Come to the table and work across the aisle so we can end this terrible situation. https://t.co/dCOCmREutg Day 19 of shutdown. Some 800K federal workers won't get paid on Friday. Low-wage fed contract workers aren‚Äôt getting paid either‚Äî&amp; they haven‚Äôt received back pay after past shutdowns. I spoke to @MPR's @CathyWurzer about how I'm working to right that wrong:https://t.co/jCoipHIKiV Glad @CNN had Brian, a Minnesota federal employee, on air to talk about his shutdown experience. I talked to Brian yesterday &amp; his story is worth a listen. He raises a key point: there are ways we can reopen the govt &amp; we should do that. I urge you to watch this clip &amp; share. https://t.co/Nw9jQZWPDh This winter I brought our chocolate lab puppy, Moose, up to the North Shore. He saw a deer, played in the snow, and spotted Lake Superior for the first time. And I saw an eagle! Moments like this remind me why winter in Minnesota is so special. #OnlyInMN https://t.co/4XeQzzRDQY This shutdown is a waste &amp; increasingly harmful. We need to reopen the government. I stand in solidarity with the 1000s of workers and contractors going without pay, so I will be donating my Senate salary for the duration of the current shutdown to The Advocates for Human Rights. Tonight we heard the same thing we‚Äôve been hearing from the President for two years. He again offered no solutions. What remains is people are hurting. We need to reopen the government. It‚Äôs day 18 of Trump‚Äôs shutdown and I want to hear how it's affecting Minnesotans. If you‚Äôre a federal worker or a contract worker, or even just a taxpayer who wants its government to work, please comment below, send me a direct message, or call my office at (651) 221-1016. https://t.co/evsWOmSsBG I‚Äôm moved by how bravely Nicole continues to share her story. She is working to make sure Americans can afford their insulin &amp; I helped bring her to Washington so she could share her story with others.
 
Please read this &amp; let's work to ‚Üì Rx drug prices. https://t.co/O0HMVpFXRg .@senatemajldr can't just outsource the Senate to the President. There are bills sitting on the Senate floor RIGHT NOW that could resolve large portions of Trump's shutdown. He should call for a vote so we can end this terrible situation. https://t.co/eItgGdSfM5 I‚Äôll soon be discussing the latest news re: Trump‚Äôs shutdown on @Morning_Joe. I‚Äôm working on a bill to help low-wage fed contract workers who‚Äôve been furloughed bc of this shutdown get the pay they deserve. They haven‚Äôt received back pay after previous shutdowns. That‚Äôs unfair. https://t.co/ZgfQ6Tiair Some of the people getting hit the hardest by Trump‚Äôs shutdown are low-wage federal contract employees. They‚Äôre not getting paid &amp; haven‚Äôt received back pay after previous shutdowns. I‚Äôll be on @Morning_Joe tmrw at 7:40 am ET to discuss what I‚Äôm doing to right that wrong. RT @cbcasithappens: 'It's already lasted too long': Tonight, @SenTinaSmith on the U.S. government shutdown. Intvu@6:30pm / 10:00pm @MPR / 1‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve worked with State Rep &amp; County Commissioner Tom Rukavina, planned with him, argued with him, laughed with him, and organized with him. I never doubted that he always put his beloved Iron Range and the Rangers who built their lives there first. Irreplaceable. He‚Äôll be missed. https://t.co/5Rum3Jm4Be And @GovTimWalz and @LtGovFlanagan, thank you for stepping up for this state that we love! We need your energy, determination, talent and leadership to build #OneMinnesota. Congrats on your inauguration today. One of the great honors of my professional life has been to work with @GovMarkDayton to build a better Minnesota. He is a true public servant, fearless, compassionate, funny, and a man of integrity. Mark, your state is grateful for your service! https://t.co/kiGD9Sra3f Stop thinking only about yourself @realdonaldtrump. And stop using federal workers and contractors, who need a paycheck to pay their bills, as bargaining chips for a political symbol. And also, your shutdown shouldn‚Äôt be used to threaten families who count on SNAP to feed kids. https://t.co/ZKM1MMphGj Sat down w/ @MSNBC‚Äôs @chrislhayes to discuss Trump‚Äôs shutdown‚Äîa complete waste for tax payers. I‚Äôm working on a bill to help low-wage workers who‚Äôve been furloughed bc of the shutdown get the pay they deserve. This is abt fairness &amp; making sure ppl can provide for their families. https://t.co/YA4DIb48L4 Happy 91st Birthday to my dear friend Walter Mondale! https://t.co/3t4mnbLj5t Fed up with big pharma putting profits ahead of consumers, forcing people (maybe you) to pay sky-high Rx prices? Me too. I‚Äôm committed to tackling this problem. Thanks @CBSNews for covering the ‚Üë cost of #insulin &amp; MN @NSmithholt12 for sharing her story. https://t.co/9lQxZbFb51 It‚Äôs day 14 of Trump‚Äôs shutdown. Some ppl who could be hurt most: low-wage federal contractor employees.

They aren‚Äôt getting paid‚Äî&amp; haven‚Äôt received BACK PAY after previous shutdowns. 

I'll be introducing a bill to right that wrong. This is abt fairness.
https://t.co/wrMF0dPQUg The Trump Administration is using federal workers as bargaining chips for a political symbol and giving themselves pay raises. What kind of leadership is this?!https://t.co/GB9Rvk23ot Today I was sworn in as Senator of Minnesota for the second time in one year. An incredible experience. I‚Äôm fired up and ready to get things done for you, your family, and all those who call our state home. It‚Äôs an honor to work for you. https://t.co/c4kivnabIb Hey Minnesota, Archie here. Excited to be in Washington D.C. for Tina‚Äôs swearing in today. Wearing this special tie for her big day! https://t.co/MairYPSWMG Touched down in D.C. with Archie in tow. Excited that he'll be standing next to me when I am sworn in tomorrow. https://t.co/jJ5iIkN9ui The Trump Admin tried to quietly make a proposal that‚Äôd seriously harm our health when families were busy during the holidays. Let‚Äôs not let them slip this under the rug. Spread the word and speak out against this atrocious idea. https://t.co/XttE4lmCTX Headed back to DC, frustrated that the President won‚Äôt come to the table to end the government shutdown, but proud that tomorrow I‚Äôll be sworn in with a historic number of women who will be serving in Congress. When people say, ‚Äúyou really hit the ground running", I sometimes think of when I was a Senate intern &amp; literally fell down the Capitol steps in a hurry, papers flying. That‚Äôs what it has felt like sometimes as a new Senator. Read my reflection on 2018:‚Äã https://t.co/6NiwII3WLz As I look to the next year ahead, I‚Äôm focusing on how I can build on Minnesota solutions &amp; local efforts at the federal level, so we can create economic opportunity for all. I took some time to pen an op-ed for @duluthnews. Will you take a look? Read here: https://t.co/6UXBQmM1RK Native women should not be invisible. I remember Savanna Greywind‚Äîwho was murdered and so could never mother her child. I‚Äôm grateful for @SenatorHeitkamp‚Äôs leadership, and I stand with @lisamurkowski to pass Savanna‚Äôs Law next year. https://t.co/YkCYTYxLUU Merry Christmas Minnesota https://t.co/779HYruRHr I honestly think it would be better for the world if the President stopped watching TV, put down his phone, &amp; went to Mar-a-Lago right now. Safer. https://t.co/DW1uFFcyZX That means Americans will be denied some vital government services and thousands of federal employees will go into the holidays without the certainty of a paycheck. The president must come to the table so we can pass legislation to re-open the government as soon as possible. A shutdown isn‚Äôt good for anyone. That‚Äôs why Senate Republicans and Democrats came together on a reasonable deal that would‚Äôve kept the government open. The president rejected it. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the very definition of strength and grit. She‚Äôs a force who can stand up to anything‚Äîcancer included. Wishing RBG good health and recovery.

https://t.co/klsuVnvC6t Read Mattis‚Äô resignation letter, and you‚Äôll see why it's absolutely essential for Congress to do our job &amp; maintain a stable, coherent foreign policy in this dangerous time. Because his letter provides the strongest argument for why it‚Äôs up to us to maintain order. https://t.co/g1o0Nk21XV Late last night, while waiting for a vote, my colleagues &amp; I sung Christmas Carols together, in direct contravention of Senate Rules, because in this extraordinary time, &amp; on top of all you see on the Cable News, singing almost always makes you feel better.https://t.co/VXWMGoQrBr Today, after months of hard work and compromise, the bipartisan #FarmBill is now law. This bill brings much-needed stability and predictability to ag communities, and is an example of how we can get things done in Washington when we work together. https://t.co/NSyLqLda6S It‚Äôs impossible to negotiate with two kinds of people: people whose words don‚Äôt predict how they will act. And people who don't have support so cannot reliably deliver the votes. https://t.co/TAntZ87zRY Since when is $20 BILLION in revenue considered financial hardship? 
 
@EPA‚Äôs decision to grant a waiver to exempt Exxon Mobil from RFS requirements is bogus. This abuse destroys biofuel demand and‚Äîat the end of the day‚Äîhurts Minnesota ag and our economy.

https://t.co/tuolth5Uty Update: The @CFPB came to its senses and decided not to prioritize changing its name. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on what really matters: protecting consumers‚Äô legal rights, and holding financial institutions accountable. https://t.co/ivWZfLitHM Days after my visit to Tornillo detention center, the Trump Admin announced a policy change that‚Äôll release approx 2k kids in gov't custody across the country. This is a victory, but we can‚Äôt give up the fight. There‚Äôs much more we must do to stand up for these kids &amp; families. https://t.co/3DEjFQaKDq You probably heard that the Senate passed a historic bipartisan bill yesterday to make our criminal justice system fairer. But what will it actually do? @SenBooker and I took a minute to explain: https://t.co/EaoIBzZRCM Facebook users expect their messages to be private. Then Facebook reportedly let companies "read, write, and delete users‚Äô private messages.‚Äù 

Spoiler alert: This ain‚Äôt good.
https://t.co/9MR44HDOrw Hey @SenatorHeitkamp, I can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next! You've been a great friend on so many issues‚Äîfighting for pensions, for native women, for agriculture &amp; for the ‚Äúgreat &amp; good work‚Äù that we strive to do together. Thank you for showing me the ropes here in the US Senate. https://t.co/WD62ij0qCQ So many students walk into class with the weight of the world on their shoulders. We need to address these invisible burdens kids carry. @NPR reporter @CherylWeinstock highlights the innovative steps some colleges are taking to meet the mental health needs of students: https://t.co/1iyPna9SFt Excited to see the University of Minnesota has appointed its first female President in its 167-year history. Congratulations Joan Gabel, and thank you for stepping up to lead a great institution. https://t.co/78Kdtb8nfa The U.S. holds more prisoners than any other country in the world.

Our prison system disproportionately impacts ppl of color.

We put an undue # of non-violent, low-level offenders behind bars for years.

Time to pass #FirstStepAct to make federal criminal justice system fairer. https://t.co/rI0crQGu7j We have around 15,000 children in detention facilities like the one that I saw this weekend during my trip to the border. I discussed what I witnessed with @mitchellreports on MSNBC. https://t.co/3y4mQk41IP I‚Äôll be sharing some of what I saw and learned during my recent visit to America‚Äôs southern border in Texas with @wccoradio‚Äôs Dave Lee around 7:20 a.m. CT today. Also hope to discuss recent news regarding the #ACA. Hope you‚Äôll tune in. Minnesota has a tradition of welcoming those coming to US to escape violence &amp; build better lives. We believe all should be treated with dignity and respect. I joined colleagues @SenJeffMerkley, @maziehirono, @RepJudyChu, @RepBetoORourke on southern border to press this MN value. https://t.co/gXIolrKkh8 I was told not to talk to any of the 2,700 children being held at Tornillo detention center because it would disrupt them. 

The *real* disruption going on here is the detention of these kids. This is not how we should be treating children. https://t.co/Y663AT0kW9 This morning I was at the border of Texas and Mexico at the Tornillo d‚Äãetention center. The kids in this center should be with their families, but instead we're holding them in detention in the Texas desert. I'll be sharing more later. These stories need to be heard. https://t.co/EFo6fqZy8e On the eve of last day to sign up for health coverage, threats are being made abt critical health care millions rely on.

ACA is still the law of the land. Today is the last day to sign up for Jan. 1 coverage in MN through @MNsure. If you‚Äôve already enrolled, you have coverage! I spent yesterday visiting two detention centers‚Äîthey are billed as residences, but that is the wrong word. Residences are where people live. These places are jails. I took some time to write about my day in Texas yesterday, and I hope you give it a read: https://t.co/86mfim1rDi Ruling by federal judge in TX to undermine historic health care legislation‚Äîif the decision is allowed to stand‚Äîwould be catastrophic. It would rob millions of health care coverage and would return us to the days when people could be denied coverage bc of pre-existing conditions. Spent the day visiting two child and family detention centers in Texas. Seeing all of this is one thing, but I want to be a part of coming up with solutions to reform our immigration system too. We need to stand up for kids and families. https://t.co/vCuHmOj823 I think no matter what you think about immigration policy, we can all agree this level of human suffering is unconscionable. Please keep sharing these stories. Some say they were told that if they request medical care multiple times, they will be deported. I‚Äôve heard about how medical units are being used to house people as ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù even if the offense is something like a 2-yr-old hitting another 2-yr-old. So far, I‚Äôve heard about a fourteen-year-old who has been in custody for five months and may shortly be ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù her Quincea√±era there. I‚Äôve been told she‚Äôs having suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôm at America‚Äôs southern border, where I'll be seeing firsthand how families and kids are being treated at three detention centers in Texas. https://t.co/mI4RGvdtJb Last June this country rose up &amp; condemned Trump‚Äôs zero tolerance policy of separating kids from their parents. I‚Äôm at the border today to understand what‚Äôs happening w/ many of the 15K kids in custody &amp; how this tragic death of a 7-year-old girl happened.https://t.co/PQ8SxNKqqL I'm currently on my way to the U.S. southern border. I'll be seeing firsthand how families &amp; kids are being treated at three detention centers in TX. @SenJeffMerkley, @maziehirono, @RepJudyChu, &amp; @RepBetoORourke will be there too. I'll be sharing as much as I can with you all. Ten. Consecutive. Wins. 
 
Oh, and zero losses. 
 
@GopherWBB is one of only four undefeated teams in the country. Couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the team and @Lindsay_13‚Äôs inaugural year as Gopher head coach.
