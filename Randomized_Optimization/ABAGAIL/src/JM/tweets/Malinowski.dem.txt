It still saddens me that we have virtually stopped admitting refugees to America, turning our backs on a tradition of generosity rooted in the lessons of WWII. The president didn‚Äôt even mention gun violence in his #SOTU. But we‚Äôre moving forward. I‚Äôm supporting universal background checks and will be an original cosponsor of legislation to restore the ban on military style assault weapons. The president movingly honored Judah Samet, a Holocaust survivor who found safety and freedom in our country as a child. Yet under the president‚Äôs refugee policies, Mr. Samet could not have come to America. The president rightly applauded Matthew Charles, released from prison under bipartisan criminal justice reform. But as an ex-felon in Tennessee, Matthew will never be able to vote. I hope the president will back our effort in H.R. 1 to fix that. I cheered the president‚Äôs call to come together on issues like infrastructure. But I heard more specifics about building walls than bridges.

The GOP Congress threw away 100s of billions of to help corporations buy back their stocks, and the market has still lost all its gains this year. That money could have been invested in infrastructure, or saved for a rainy day. https://t.co/V9SFynG0vr This feels like a good day to repost our message on rejecting fear. I'm guessing there will be more reasons to do so in the next 13 days. Focus! https://t.co/z3CRn6364i @cccapone We‚Äôd love to have you volunteer!  You can sign up on our website, https://t.co/wpY4KyT67f "In the 7th District, where Republican Rep. Leonard Lance is running against former Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski, 7,384 Democrats have voted already compared with 6,419 Republicans. Democratic turnout rose 335% to 212% for Republicans." https://t.co/1xb7ngQivP The GOP members of the Problem Solvers Caucus have the votes right now to force action on bipartisan bills in the House. Why won‚Äôt they? https://t.co/0RiVQjQ589 RT @ASlavitt: BREAKING: Trump Administration releases new rule to allow states to add plans which don‚Äôt cover pre-existing conditions.

2 w‚Ä¶ @BrendanRMcGrath Yes we will be everywhere for GOTV weekend. America is full of refugees from dictatorships. If the Saudis (or Russia, Egypt, China, etc.) have a "general order to retrieve dissidents in exile," then justice for Khashoggi is not enough. We have a paramount interest in stopping this practice. https://t.co/lwuYXAsK6S @BrendanRMcGrath We‚Äôve been working hard in both Union Townships‚Äî in Union and Hunterdon Counties! Check out our website for ways to help. My mom canvassed Flemington today, and my daughter Emily knocked on doors in Union. We got this! https://t.co/x1dVFl1JAL The New York Times has endorsed our campaign! "Malinowski makes a better case for bipartisanship that can get results with Democratic leadership." https://t.co/3BWTMR7WPD The sound of the suburbs: A Democrat leads in New Jersey‚Äôs seventh district https://t.co/fCG0VObyKV via @TheEconomist I agree. In 2016, I helped spearhead passage of the Global Magnitsky Act, and as a State Dept. official successfully pushed to suspend arms sales to the Saudis. In 2017, Trump reversed that suspension and resumed sales. You did nothing. https://t.co/9tlPV7gN9c Funny, this is just what my opponent said in our debate this week! No one is fooled‚Äîwe trust his votes, not his quotes. https://t.co/NXAyiZtVqt When we #RejectFear, we can make the changes New Jersey needs. https://t.co/XsEfsO819a RT @VoteSalmon: It's fascinating that @RepLanceNJ7 rejects @Malinowski's statement that Lance voted 60+ times to dismantle the Affordable C‚Ä¶ @GeriModell It will. üòä I'm honored to have the endorsement of the Brady Campaign. The current Congress has done nothing to protect our kids from gun violence. Let's elect a Congress that will act from day one. https://t.co/hSPegkD7iF
