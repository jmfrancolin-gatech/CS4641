I am ready and willing to work with the President and my Congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens and improves our border security, but before we do so the President must reopen the government immediately. The Trump Administration released an incomplete #climatechange report that fell well short of what my amendment required. @nkus does a great job of outlining how it missed the mark. #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity https://t.co/KSjxY8aY5c The domino effects of the #TrumpShutdown continue to cause hardship. Schools and families across the country should never have to worry about being able to feed their kids. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/zNFUrppPz0 If, as reported, the President Trump instructed his personal attorney to commit perjury before Congress, he has obstructed justice.

We must #ProtectCleanWater.  https://t.co/dbjNFaTiIe Proud to join #CTE Caucus co-chair @CongressmanGT on the House Floor yesterday to highlight our new bill that incorporates #cybersecurity into #CTE programs so workers who deal with critical systems have the skills to keep us safe. https://t.co/QpsXiHzbyx Matthew‚Äôs story is heartwarming.
