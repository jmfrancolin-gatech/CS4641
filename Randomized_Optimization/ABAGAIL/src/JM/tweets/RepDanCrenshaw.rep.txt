GOP has asked for a vote on a bill that protects infants born alive after an attempted abortion. 

Shouldn't this already be in law, you might ask? Not according to Democrats, who won't even bring it to a vote. The left's position on abortion has reached new levels of extremism. While I was at the border last week, 1,000 migrants were apprehended in one night. Border agents are facing a migrant caravan every night. Let‚Äôs give them the resources they‚Äôve requested to do the crucial job we ask them to do. Proud to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this done. 
 
Valor knows no rank. Providing full military honors is the least we can do for our Prisoners Of War and Medal Of Honor recipients. 
 
https://t.co/Qws5cGZj2V Thanks for having me, @Morning_Joe! https://t.co/4Jy7qCfPpD Last night, I ran into @repbuddycarter and his #SOTU guest Lt. Col. Ken Dwyer, who lost his left eye. Together we have a full visual field! #Neverforget https://t.co/qqOBNhzXF8 Our first #SOTU. https://t.co/QnZLQut6tj My thoughts on tonight's #SOTU: https://t.co/ynSfZuVEG2 Last week on the House floor, I called on Congress to stop the political games and take action on border security. I laid out the real story behind this debate, the wall, and the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs comprehensive border plan. 

https://t.co/662kx6VxYj Looking forward to tonight‚Äôs #SOTU. @POTUS will lay out his vision for the country &amp; highlight the progress we‚Äôve made. While we‚Äôve accomplished a lot, we still have work to do, especially when it comes to securing our border. Be sure to tune in at 9pm ET/ 8pm CT tonight! https://t.co/qbzywA07uQ Great turnout at our meet and greet this weekend. Thanks to those who attended! https://t.co/EVFvIjl7Uu This is the very reason I wanted to be on the Budget Committee. Mandatory spending accounts for 70% of our federal spending. We desperately need commonsense reforms to ensure programs, such as social security, are there for the next generation. https://t.co/broVY2Vb6y One of the best parts about my job: this week I got to tell a young Texan that he was accepted to West Point. I‚Äôm grateful for the next generation‚Äôs willingness to serve. This commitment will shape the rest of his life. Can‚Äôt wait to see what this young man accomplishes! https://t.co/tlKdXjzQVm Biggest takeaway from my trip to the border: walls work.

There's a reason our border patrol agents request physical barriers - they help them accomplish the very difficult mission we ask them to do. https://t.co/K99Xzg9I0g Reminder to TX-02 residents: join me tomorrow at Little Woodrow's Midtown from 4:30-6:00 pm CT. We‚Äôll discuss what I‚Äôve been doing in Congress to serve you &amp; the truth about border security. 

RSVP here: https://t.co/leSEm4HnWu https://t.co/hDWNh9tOB7 When you deregulate and reduce taxes on an innovative, entrepreneurial population like we have in the US, we thrive. We create jobs. Wages rise. 

America is the place that everyone wants to be. And yet, we still debate the merits of these pro-growth policies. https://t.co/JYmDdKiVLp If you‚Äôve been following updates, you know I‚Äôm in the Rio Grande Valley to get the real story on the border from Customs and Border Protection. 

Tonight I‚Äôll be joining @SeanHannity on @FoxNews to discuss what we‚Äôve learned. Tune in at 8:25pm CT! In Rio Grande Valley sector today at the southern border.
 
Brownsville area has 35 miles of fencing and accounts for 6% of illegal apprehensions.
 
McAllen, 45 minutes to the west, has sparse fencing and accounts for 94% of illegal apprehensions.
 
But walls don‚Äôt work, right? TX-02 residents: join me on Saturday at Little Woodrow‚Äôs Midtown to discuss what I‚Äôve been doing in Congress to serve you &amp; the truth about border security. Hope to see you there! https://t.co/GJ6r3FbT3m As Venezuelans again take to the streets to fight for freedom, socialist dictator Maduro claims he is open to negotiations. History tells us this is a facade. 
 
To the people of Venezuela ‚Äì continue raising your voices, we hear you &amp; support you.  

https://t.co/cl4KczIVae RT @RepDanCrenshaw: @amy_kaymay Hey Jury! üëãüèº https://t.co/ZFsuQRi8O0 @amy_kaymay Hey Jury! üëãüèº https://t.co/ZFsuQRi8O0 Proud to cosponsor this legislation. Federal employees should never have to carry the burden caused by a dysfunctional government. The President, Vice President and Congress should have to feel the same pain and uncertainty that our federal employees face during a shutdown. https://t.co/FACJHnY8dB Praying for a swift recovery for these courageous officers. They put their lives in danger to keep us safe. It‚Äôs an honorable and admirable job. We are eternally grateful for their service. https://t.co/vAJD0fXPMy Looking forward to it. Tune in at 2:30pm ET! https://t.co/GmJWGUb4CO Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston to celebrate their 20th Anniversary. Thanks @IACCGHouston for 2 decades of empowering the Indian business community through education &amp; encouraging bilateral trading opportunities. https://t.co/yJ2f1Wknoq This morning I joined @fox26houston to discuss the President temporarily reopening the government and our border security plan. The government is now open. No more excuses from Democrats. Let‚Äôs hear why they won‚Äôt support holistic border security, I‚Äôm all ears. https://t.co/sn4CeC81z4 On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the millions of lives lost at the hands of hatred, including six million Jewish victims.  We commemorate the WWII veterans from around the globe who risked their lives to end the evils of a hateful ideology. #WeRemember Good news not just for Texas, a global energy leader, but for the whole country. Energy independence means cleaner and cheaper energy for all of us. 

https://t.co/YPybgyuJfq Congress must reach a reasonable, realistic solution to fund our government and protect our border. Governing from shutdown to shutdown cannot be a new norm. Our federal employees should not carry the burden of government dysfunction.

Let‚Äôs get this done for the American people. The President demonstrated yet again he is willing to make a deal. I‚Äôm hopeful this will spur serious and thoughtful negotiations. 

Securing our border is a bipartisan issue. Improving our border security through a multifaceted approach is a win for everyone. The United States stands with #Venezuela and Juan Guaid√≥. I‚Äôm proud to back our President on this one. I‚Äôve witnessed this beautiful country deteriorate, and it‚Äôs time to end the suffering. Watch my statement below: https://t.co/8DlEFiMF5i Honored to be appointed to @househomeland and @housebudgetgop. This is where I need to be: improving our national security and disaster preparedness, and looking out for the next generation by fighting for responsible and sustainable spending. Joining @foxnews momentarily to discuss the shutdown, border security and everything House GOP is doing to reopen the government and pay our federal employees. Tune in! Update: House GOP voted again to pay federal employees. This time just ten Democrats joined us: https://t.co/WkNAXfi4mj

Actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/aZwEzgIr8U Great meeting with students from Kingwood High School and Incarnate Word Academy! We talked about what it‚Äôs like to work in Congress. My door is always open to our future leaders. Thanks for stopping by. https://t.co/tv47M9V9W4 Great piece on the efficiency of physical barriers at a border. We‚Äôve seen it work time after time in Yuma, San Diego, Tucson and as detailed here in Laredo, TX. A wall is a critical part of securing our border. https://t.co/wFSOh7cOpt Big deal that never got reported:

Last week, House GOP voted to pay federal employees their 1st paycheck of 2019, despite shutdown. Only 6 Dems voted with us. It failed.

Dem priority is not paying workers or opening gov't. It is opposing Trump. 
https://t.co/i9TKGIjRnY I‚Äôm proud to stand with the Administration as we recognize the only democratically elected body in Venezuela. https://t.co/cj2TeQj3uL Today we celebrate the incredible life &amp; legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He dedicated his life to standing up for what is just, despite great adversity. Our society is better because of his selfless work. May his words and example live on forever. #MLKDay https://t.co/61isCJPc2L The President‚Äôs proposal demonstrates his commitment to reopening our govt and addressing the crisis at the border. Pelosi rejected this compromise outright. 

Dem colleagues: come to the table and negotiate in good faith. It is our duty to secure our border and reopen the govt. This is a great write-up of the Patriots we lost this week in Syria. #NeverForget 

https://t.co/ZmREfZFLDR It's time for the United States to strongly consider recognizing Juan Guaid√≥ as acting President of Venezuela. Maduro's reign of terror has gone on too long. Venezuelans are suffering, and the region is destabilizing. @StateDept https://t.co/WgVtZHQuNI I commend my colleagues for wanting to honor our troops.
 
But on day 27 of the shutdown &amp; no end in sight, our first priority should be negotiating a deal. Not trips to Puerto Rico or congressional delegation trips abroad.
 
Time to do our job: secure the border, reopen the govt Joined @DanaPerino to discuss today‚Äôs suicide attack in Syria. My heart goes out to the families of the service members who lost their lives. We need to keep up the fight against ISIS so that these soldiers' lives were not lost in vain. Never Forget. https://t.co/yOkkzSLW3j Today we celebrate #ReligiousFreedomDay. All religions have a place in America.

No more harassing religious bakers.

No more unconstitutional questioning (see Article VI) of judicial nominees' faith.

No more forcing employers and doctors to act against their conscience. I joined @GovAbbott, @SenTedCruz, @JohnCornyn and fellow Texans in the House in asking President Trump to protect Harvey relief funding. We must secure our border, but it cannot be at the expense of relief funds. 
https://t.co/kf9DP0dGle Proud to vote in favor of H. Res. 41, which denounced white nationalism and white supremacy. Rep. Steve King‚Äôs comments have no place in this country. White supremacy cannot be tolerated in any form. Democrats literally will not come to the table to end this shutdown. They must explain to the American people why their grandstanding is more important than our security and a fully functional government.    https://t.co/XjX99uzQ5H Expert-led, holistic border security:

-234 miles of physical barrier 
-$800M for medical/humanitarian 
-More law enforcement
-Counter-drug tech at points of entry
-More immigration judges
-Better detention facilities 

Not a ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù wall. A real solution. Retweet the truth. The implications of the partial government shutdown are real and painful. Enough is enough. We need to negotiate a deal and end this shutdown for the sake of the American people. We all win with better border security. 

https://t.co/aMob84cvSQ Last night @ShannonBream asked me about reports indicating the Administration is considering using disaster relief funding to pay for our border security needs. Here‚Äôs what I had to say about potentially using Hurricane Harvey relief funding: https://t.co/HFjHUDbYC8 Joined @Foxnewsnight yesterday to discuss border security. Our multifaceted approach includes a wall, but is so much more than that. It's a realistic, reasonable solution. https://t.co/X64TYTNAxO Today is #NationalHumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. It‚Äôs hard to imagine a worse fate for another human being. We should always be asking ourselves: what more can we do to prevent this? This is especially important in Houston, which experiences the pain of this on such a large scale. Read my @WSJ op-ed laying out the arguments Democrats are using against a border wall and debunking each one here: https://t.co/T8ngwzKTe7 I don't usually recommend that people watch CSPAN, but Minority Whip @SteveScalise is absolutely worth watching right now. He makes a clear and coherent case for border security. Dems won't negotiate even one dollar, and they are holding federal workers hostage as a result. Great meeting with President's Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, where he assured Texans that he understood the deep concerns about using Harvey relief funds for the border. 

Best solution is still reopening government with adequate funding for border. I cannot in good conscience get paid while federal employees‚Äô financial futures hang in the balance because of this partial government shutdown. I‚Äôve asked the Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay until we have come to an agreement to adequately fund border security. https://t.co/2g37vAAtx2 Grateful for all the hardworking law enforcement officers both in #TX02 and across America. Thank you for the sacrifices you make day in and day out to protect our families, friends and communities. #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/MwanVwkfKE Democrats are pretending that this budget is about a 2,000 mile contiguous wall. They know that isn't true. It's about a multi-faceted approach to border security, which includes 234 miles of physical barriers.

Stop making arguments against an idea that doesn't exist. RT @RepMeuser: "Let‚Äôs not continue to let the people down, let‚Äôs show that this Congress can do things better."

MORE: https://t.co/wV1tb5m‚Ä¶ 5) Dismissing a wall or fence as an ‚Äúineffective‚Äù or ‚Äú4th century‚Äù solution is an attempt to undermine the plan without providing any logical reasoning. Don‚Äôt succumb to lazy arguments. Let‚Äôs think this through, and reopen the government with adequate funding for border security. 4) A wall in one location frees up manpower resources in another. This is important when understanding why we are okay with building in some areas and waiting on others. 3) Walls are necessary, but of course we recognize that they aren‚Äôt the only solution. Some places require different methods, as the President‚Äôs plan recognizes. Drones, sensors, more patrols, etc. It all works together, and physical barriers are a part of that. 2) The problem must be solved in a multi-faceted way. Physical barriers are a necessary part of that solution. Just ask the migrant caravan when they arrived in Tijuana, where the wall prevented them from overrunning our border agents. Walls mitigate movement. Period. Tonight, the President will be speaking on border security. Some things to keep in mind:

1) The problems on the border need to be addressed. 400,000 illegal aliens being apprehended per year while crossing an open border is completely unsustainable. Thank you Harris County Sheriff Office, I‚Äôm grateful for your dedicated work. This senseless tragedy took such an innocent, young life from us far too soon. As we pray for Jazmine's family, I hope this brings them some sense of justice. https://t.co/CIuTe5a4mO Great December jobs report. No denying that recent policies are working. This is what we said would happen with tax reform and deregulation ‚Äì and it did.

-      312K jobs added
-      3.2% wage growth since 2017
-      more Americans entering workforce

 https://t.co/hkwpK4gaYR 3) The belief that because you can't put a wall everywhere (i.e. the Rio Grande), that you should, therefore, put a wall nowhere. Definition of Border Denialism:

1) The belief that physical barriers can simply be ‚Äúclimbed over‚Äù‚Ä¶just like that. 

2) The belief that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno real problem‚Äù on the border because 400,000 illegals apprehended on border per year is ‚Äúinsignificant.‚Äù What a week. Honored and privileged to officially represent the great people of TX-02. I‚Äôm so thankful for your continued support. Now the real work begins. https://t.co/9bBjH1qQBa RT @GrooganFox26: A strong, first day message from newly sworn CD2 Congressman @DanCrenshawTX #Fox26 https://t.co/ZuMffvrcoZ Epic.
