RT @SierraClub: Thank you @SenatorCantwell and @SenatorBurr for defending the Land and Water Conservation Fund on the Senate floor!  Now le‚Ä¶ #SaveLWCF https://t.co/7LynuiQck8 There are more that 100+ bills included in the public lands package. Wondering what it will do for Washington?
- Saves LWCF
- Protects Methow headwaters from mining
- Increases safety for firefighters through more tech
- Addresses water challenges in Yakima Valley Scoop Jackson authored one of the all-time great access to public lands bills with the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Now making the #LWCF permanent in law gives certainty to the priority of public lands in America. The #GlobalGagRule impacts women around the globe by impacting services essential to leading a healthy life. I am proud to join @SenatorShaheen and @NitaLowey in introducing the Global HER Act to end the Global Gag Rule. @EverettHerald: "Congress is nearing passage of a package of legislation that will aid in the protection and upkeep of parks and public lands in all 50 states." https://t.co/48Fu055mFo #SaveLWCF Legislation the Senate is considering this week addresses the long-standing water challenges in the #Yakima River Basin. This measure will help protect more than $13 billion in economic output and 40,000 jobs in the Yakima Basin. https://t.co/GsEWCvEutq I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the important public lands package the Senate is considering this week. It is a balanced, bipartisan approach that will allow us to protect and responsibly steward our #publiclands. There's no question: The Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund has become an indispensable part of our nation's rapidly growing outdoor recreation economy. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/s4SAbdU30h No one should have to worry about being denied a home loan due to their race, ethnicity, age, or zip code. Transparency is key to holding banks accountable if they are engaged in unfair practices. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/MEtIVmQgTF We're working in the Senate this week to designate Washington state‚Äôs Mountains to Sound Greenway as the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs first National Heritage Area. This iconic 1.5 million-acre landscape spans from Seattle, across the Cascades, to Ellensburg in central Washington. Not only has the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund helped preserve what makes Washington state so special, it has also invested over $675 million into our economy. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/OHGR700I8e Bipartisan legislation I wrote with @SenCoryGardner to increase firefighter safety and effectiveness is being considered by the full Senate this week. Our bill would ensure #firefighters have the state-of-the-art technology they need. #LWCF protects public lands, provides recreation activities, and boosts local tourism. It has been critical in making the Pacific Crest Trail the wonder it is today‚Äîacquiring and protecting almost 23,000 acres along the trail. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/SolXETaBow So proud to see students like Hallie in Issaquah succeed in #computerscience. 90% of parents want their children to study computer science, and we should be giving them more opportunities to do so.

https://t.co/rV2oiaC3VQ This week the Senate is voting on legislation I introduced with @PattyMurray to protect the headwaters of the #Methow River. It will safeguard 340,000 acres of national forest in the Methow Valley from potential mining exploration or development. RT @icw: Terrific to spend time with @SenatorCantwell talking about #CultivatingTalent in #WA and the role of #highered in #PoweringEconomi‚Ä¶ More than 98% of American counties have a park funded by the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund. It has supported more than 42,000 projects in communities across the country. #SaveLWCF #LWCF protects land for hiking, fishing, and hunting. It was used to protect the headwaters of the Yakima River‚Äîproviding the essential habitat and water quality for thriving salmon, steelhead, and bull trout populations. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/ugr8KebDtC RT @LWCFCOALITION: Thank you @SenatorCantwell for all your work to #SaveLWCF! We appreciate it and hope that soon our outdoors can rely on‚Ä¶ #DidYouKnow: The Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund isn't just for natural spaces. It also helps build &amp; revitalize urban greenspace, neighborhood playgrounds, hiking and walking trails, ball fields, and even swimming pools. #SaveLWCF In 1964, the Senate voted by a margin of 92-1 to create the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund. I hope it will speak with similar certainty this week when we vote to permanently reauthorize #LWCF. We need to make investments in #5G, secure these networks, and make sure they are resilient against #cyberattacks. Our 21st century innovation economy depends on it. Many underserved rural and Tribal areas in Washington still lack quality wireless and wireline #broadband service. We cannot leave these areas out of the economic opportunities provided by connectivity. I believe the U.S. will continue to dominate the innovation economy. One of the best examples of this innovative spirit is the work going on in #SmartCities, and one of the best proving grounds for this technology can be found in Spokane. If we roll up our sleeves and get serious about #cyber, I believe the United States will continue to dominate the innovation economy and win the race to #5G. I‚Äôm calling on the @FCC to use its existing authority to help make sure #5G communications networks are safe and secure. Congress is watching. I am calling on the Trump administration to finally get serious about #cybersecurity. It should provide all of us with a real, quantifiable #5G security threat assessment. #5G promises interconnectivity on an unprecedented scale. These networks will be part of the bedrock of our innovation economy. Innovators in Washington state &amp; around the country are exploring how #5G will fuel the continued growth of our trillion dollar, 21st century innovation economy. This will help cement the U.S. role as a leader in the information economy. üì∫ LIVE NOW: Watch as Spokane-based #Urbanova joins me at this morning's @SenateCommerce hearing on #5G communications networks ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/nonqSnkPir This morning, the @SenateCommerce Committee is discussing #5G and its potential to provide more reliable communications to millions of Americans. Tune in at 7:00 AM PST ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/PzLOXAhxIi In Seattle, the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund provided money to clean up a former industrial site known today as Gas Works Park‚Äîa favorite along Lake Union. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/6B8PPKb76C Hundreds of organizations support the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund. Sportsmen, conservationists, veterans, and outdoor enthusiasts alike all agree that #LWCF is critical to preserving America's pristine natural spaces. #SaveLWCF The Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund has created or expanded thousands of treasured hunting, fishing, and hiking opportunities‚Äîand it has protected our cultural heritage. #SaveLWCF We need to make sure the workforce of tomorrow has the tools it needs to succeed. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for children throughout the United States to be able to learn to code in school.

https://t.co/rV2oiakt4i The Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund was championed by Washington state's own Senator Scoop Jackson in 1964. It's time we permanently reauthorize this program and protect our public lands. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/tXBp7rfsuw Proud to stand alongside @SenCortezMasto in support of legislation that gives regulators and advocates the information they need to hold banks accountable for discriminatory or unfair lending practices. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/MEtIVn7Sif Great to meet these Washington nurse practitioners with @AANP_NEWS. I‚Äôm proud to support nurse practitioners and the excellent, cost-effective care they provide. https://t.co/q4KuT9L4N1 Our public lands legislation would permanently reauthorize the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund. For more than 50 years, #LWCF has been one of the most powerful tools we have to preserve &amp; ensure access to America's most iconic landscapes. #SaveLWCF Public lands are important to millions of people in Washington and across the country. It's time for the Senate to pass the bipartisan lands package @LisaMurkowski and I have been fighting for. Wishing a Happy #LunarNewYear to everyone celebrating in Washington and across the world. May the #YearOfThePig bring happiness and prosperity to all! https://t.co/bwO76hN6dd Hallie, I absolutely agree. Every student in the United States should have the opportunity to access computer science programs in school.

https://t.co/rV2oiaC3VQ Enjoyed visiting Anacortes this weekend, where I toured Dakota Creek Industries, met with its dedicated workforce, and discussed how we can build the next generation of ships right here in Washington. https://t.co/i6cqoeakJf I am proud to continue to stand up in support of #EqualPay for women. Achieving pay equity isn‚Äôt just about fairness ‚Äì it‚Äôs good for the economy and for American families. https://t.co/GcN4AybLzH We need to make sure the workforce of tomorrow has the tools to succeed. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for kids throughout the U.S. to be able to learn coding in school &amp; that‚Äôs why I've fought in the Senate to increase access to #computerscience education.
https://t.co/rV2oiakt4i I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor legislation to make sure we provide enough funding to serve Native American victims of crime. Programs funded under the #SURVIVEact could include domestic violence shelters, medical care, counseling services, legal assistance &amp; child &amp; elder abuse programs. Native American women &amp; girls have faced devastating levels of violence in the United States. A @SIHB1 report released last year found 506 unsolved cases of missing &amp; murdered Native women &amp; girls nationwide. We can no longer sweep these statistics under the rug. #SavannasAct The #PaycheckFairness Act would help ensure that everyone is treated fairly in the workplace. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor this legislation that would bring us closer to the goal of #EqualPay for equal work. https://t.co/kPFaSAA0C2 Under the SURVIVE Act, Tribes in Washington state &amp; throughout the country will be able to apply for funding for victim assistance programs that best serve the needs of their communities. Proud to cosponsor this legislation, which passed unanimously through the @IndianCommittee. #SavannasAct would improve data collection and standardize law enforcement protocols for responding to cases of missing &amp; murdered Native women &amp; girls. It‚Äôs time to pass this legislation and get it on the president‚Äôs desk. ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/iRZyJrnM01 While we‚Äôve made progress since we passed the Equal Pay Act, we still have a long way to go. I want young women growing up today to know this is not an issue they are going to have to deal with in the future. They will get #EqualPay. Although we have made great strides, we still have work to do to achieve the goal of #EqualPay for equal work. It‚Äôs time for the Senate to end pay discrimination by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act. https://t.co/yWQiuuI7Qx Having a job that pays you equally for the work that you do is critically important. The #PaycheckFairness Act is important legislation that will help end the pay discrimination that women are seeing in the workplace. https://t.co/HNzYfwwg8q Individuals on Tribal lands experience high rates of violence, and resources from the Crime Victims Fund are critical in addressing Tribal victims‚Äô needs. Proud to work on this issue with @SenJohnHoeven, @SenatorTomUdall, @SenCortezMasto, @SenatorTester &amp; others. Nationwide there are 506 cases of murdered or missing Native American women. And too many Native American women face barriers that can prevent perpetrators from being convicted.

I'm proud to sponsor #SavannasAct to help improve reporting &amp; give communities tools they need. #OnThisDay in 2009, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. I was proud to support this big step forward in ending pay discrimination, but we still have more work to do. #EqualPay https://t.co/zNZvaoQ4lz Enjoyed hearing the stories and experiences of this @WSAHSECEAP group from Washington today. #HeadStart programs provide support for children‚Äôs growth and development through early learning, health, and family programs. https://t.co/7FCpTem7kL Today the Senate's @IndianCommittee unanimously passed the SURVIVE Act ‚Äì legislation I cosponsored to provide a substantial increase in resources for Tribal crime victim assistance programs.

Read more here ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/WDnu1ji8gT https://t.co/NvfWl6iPTw Ten years ago, I was proud to cosponsor the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which advanced the effort to end pay discrimination and ensured that courthouse doors would remain open for women contesting this injustice. #Ledbetter10 I'm proud to sponsor #SavannasAct, which would:

‚úîÔ∏èEmpower Tribal governments with the resources they need in cases involving missing &amp; murdered indigenous women &amp; girls
‚úîÔ∏èIncrease coordination among all levels of law enforcement
‚úîÔ∏èIncrease data collection &amp; information sharing https://t.co/R2ZES9RMI6 Proud to join @LisaMurkowski, @SenCortezMasto, and others to reintroduce #SavannasAct to combat the epidemic of murdered and missing Native women and girls.

It's time to pass this legislation and get it on the president's desk.

https://t.co/IlvdxTptHl On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the millions of other victims of Nazism. We remember those who suffered, those who died, and those who spoke out.

Glad to see Washington state leading on cross laminated timber.

https://t.co/dN2opzU44Q Great to see Port Angeles make this investment in cross-laminated timber, which allows for faster construction of buildings, more eco-friendly buildings, and new timber jobs.

https://t.co/dN2opzU44Q This #KC46 tanker is a true testament to the hard work and ingenuity that make Washington state a worldwide leader in the aerospace and aviation industries.

I‚Äôm so proud that Boeing‚Äôs Washington state workforce is building the most advanced tanker in the world. https://t.co/z2v5ArViWr It's time to reopen the government and reduce any further harm to Tribal #healthcare. The ongoing Trump shutdown has already decreased or ceased critical services to our American Indian and Alaska Native community. The economy of the future is one that we need to invest in, whether it's science, R&amp;D, or a skilled workforce. But we also have to protect consumers and focus on consumer advocacy. I look forward to working with members of the @SenateCommerce committee on both sides of the aisle. After the Affordable Care Act was implemented, the uninsured rate fell to its lowest level ever. But following President Trump‚Äôs deliberate sabotage of the #healthcare system, that number is going back up significantly. #ProtectOurCare

https://t.co/ztGXcDpsCr Because of the #TrumpShutdown, an estimated 2.2 million low-income households are among those at risk of eviction from their homes. For the sake of the families whose homes are at stake, this shutdown must end.

https://t.co/RwAlnbV5xu What happens if the ACA is ultimately struck down?

‚ùé17-20 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage
‚ùéCoverage for those with pre-existing conditions would no longer be guaranteed
‚ùéCaps on out-of-pocket patient costs would be eliminated

https://t.co/XVrIrEAHgu If the #TrumpShutdown continues, 62% of urban Indian health programs will have to cancel programs or cease offering services, and more than half will be forced to lay off essential staff. It's time to fund the rest of the government now. #TribalHealth The percentage of Americans without health insurance is at its highest since 2014, and 7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected.

We should be working to expand access to affordable #healthcare, not cut it off. https://t.co/aRWCINCjm5 Along with my colleagues in the @SenateCommerce Committee, I look forward to working to protect consumer privacy and data, address oceans, fisheries and #climatechange issues, and work on American competitiveness to meet the challenges of an international marketplace. Our legislation to #RaiseTheWage would:

‚úÖGradually raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2024
‚úÖIndex future increases to median wage growth
‚úÖPhase out subminimum wages for tipped workers, youth workers, and workers with disabilities

I‚Äôm proud to stand with you as one of #7in10ForRoe. https://t.co/muAQ49sXBj We must defeat this discriminatory policy. Transgender service members are honorable and patriotic, and they must receive our utmost respect and dignity. https://t.co/hEa5631sJd From the @EverettHerald Editorial Board: "If tens of millions are to keep the coverage they have now... the ACA must be successfully defended in the courts, and Congress must continue to look for ways to keep costs down for everyone."

https://t.co/XVrIrEj6oW The Seattle Indian Health Board serves 6,000 people each year, but the ongoing government shutdown has undermined its inpatient substance use disorder and traditional health services. This is one of many human impacts of the #TrumpShutdown. We need to reopen the government now. Unless these #firefighter trainings &amp; forest health projects resume soon, the health &amp; safety of our communities mostly in rural areas will be put at risk during this government shutdown.

I‚Äôve strongly urged the president to reopen the government now.

https://t.co/Lsqc7iwoI6 The @SenateCommerce Committee has a long record of working in a bipartisan fashion. We have lots of work to do investing in #infrastructure, strengthening #cybersecurity, expanding rural #broadband, boosting commercial space, and continuing our #aviation modernization. #DidYouKnow: A $15 minimum wage by 2024 would generate $144 billion in higher wages for workers, benefiting their local economies. #RaiseTheWage Why is it important that we defend the Affordable Care Act? 

"Loss of the ACA would mean those with pre-existing conditions would likely face more costly insurance coverage, assuming they could obtain coverage.‚Äù

https://t.co/XVrIrEAHgu Throughout his life, Martin Luther King Jr. was a powerful advocate for justice, and his leadership helped create the dynamic America we know today. Dr. King's dream continues to inspire us and his vision of progress reminds us that we still have much more work to do. #MLKDay https://t.co/127FC6kfQw Because of the #TrumpShutdown, #TribalHealth programs like the Thunderbird Treatment Center could be interrupted. This facility helps people recover from substance abuse, including opioid addiction, and is just 1 of many important Tribal services being impacted by this shutdown. The failure to reopen the government puts lives at risk by undermining the ability to respond to #wildfires and will only serve to delay critical forest restoration &amp; safety projects. Every day the shutdown continues, the more the fire risk for the 2019 season grows. I'd like to welcome @SenJackyRosen, a truly high-tech senator, to the @SenateCommerce Committee. Senator Rosen knows several languages in coding and brings strength and knowledge on workforce and STEM issues to the Senate. Because of the #TrumpShutdown:

‚úñÔ∏èMore than 6,400 civilian employees of the @USCG have been furloughed, including 130 in WA.

It's time to reopen the government. I've reintroduced a resolution to defend Americans‚Äô #healthcare against a dangerous Republican lawsuit. If the GOP lawsuit succeeds, the entire Affordable Care Act‚Äî#Medicaid expansion, insurance protections, delivery system reforms &amp; more‚Äîcould be stripped away. The federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009, but legislation I introduced this week would give nearly 40 million low-wage workers a raise, increasing the wages of almost 30% of the U.S. workforce. #RaiseTheWage Nearly all of the @TSA‚Äôs 60,000 employees are not receiving pay during the #TrumpShutdown, and about 55,000 are working without pay in an effort to keep up with ongoing air travel operations ‚Äì including 875 TSA employees impacted at @SeaTacAirport. It's time to end this shutdown. Because of the #TrumpShutdown, an estimated 2.2 million low-income households are among those at risk of eviction from their homes. For the sake of the families whose homes are at stake, I've urged President Trump to end the shutdown and protect the American people. What's at stake if Republican attorneys general are successful in striking down the Affordable Care Act?

"Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions... would no longer be assured."

#ProtectOurCare

https://t.co/XVrIrEAHgu We must end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; fund the government to keep access to #healthcare for Tribal communities. @SIHB1 serves 6,000 people each year but with 23% of its budget coming from @Interior, it may have to implement a furlough &amp; layoff plan that could jeopardize #TribalHealth.

Our state is proof that we can simultaneously grow our economy and ensure workers are paid a living wage. #RaiseTheWage The #TrumpShutdown is undermining @HUDgov's affordable housing programs that serve over 4 million Americans, the majority of whom are seniors and people with disabilities living on a fixed income. It's past time for President Trump to end his shutdown and reopen the government. If the Affordable Care Act is ultimately struck down, "Between 17-20 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage, including those who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid in a number of states, including Washington state."

https://t.co/XVrIrEj6oW I've long emphasized affordable housing in my work in the Senate, and it's great to see @Microsoft make this a priority as well. This couldn't come at a better time ‚Äì almost half of Washington state renters spend over 30% of their income on rent.
