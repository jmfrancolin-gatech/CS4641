What an incredible honor to preside over the U.S. House of Representatives today as Speaker Pro Tempore as members honored the lifetime of service Congressman Dingell gave to our country. https://t.co/p4dRZsyL6c Happening Now: Presiding over the House Floor for the first time since elected to Congress.   üì∫ Tune in! üì∫  here -&gt;https://t.co/Q3ERpMJms2 Today is my first committee hearing w/ @TransportDems! I'm eager to address the infrastructure crisis facing our country. Did you know Iowa has the worst bridges in the US? Iowa drivers cross structurally deficient bridges more than 1.3 million times every day. #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/L9NIMVeQpA Too many Iowans suffered during the government shutdown. Today I joined my colleagues on @housesmallbiz to listen to small business owners talk about the risks of another reckless shutdown. https://t.co/KNhMFZXSFP Tune in! https://t.co/f2pYkqRCE5 Lots of thoughts about tonight‚Äôs #SOTU, but for now, taking a moment to celebrate that for the first time in our nation‚Äôs history during the President‚Äôs address, on the floor of the US House sat some Congresswomen from Iowa. Proud to serve with @RepCindyAxne https://t.co/d9e2mjfCDC RT @iowademocrats: Oh hey, it‚Äôs Iowa‚Äôs first Congresswomen, @RepFinkenauer and @RepCindyAxne. üòçüòç #SOTU https://t.co/3LijHpZ747 Honored to share the #SOTU w/Jesse. He lives in West Union &amp; called me during the shutdown bc his FSA coworkers were struggling. This is not the way we treat the ppl helping our farmers. I listened &amp; promised to do everything I could to stop it from happening again. https://t.co/MqdsSej7iw 'Folks are tired of the chaos &amp; division.' Great to talk to @NPR about tonight's #SOTU. We need real action on the issues affecting #IA01 families. 
 https://t.co/g3NJCbiP1I Celebrating the birthday and incredible legacy of civil rights activist Rosa Parks today. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/lA4KOXVA54 Such an honor to tour the Iowa Veteran‚Äôs Home in #Marshalltown today to meet with the residents &amp; dedicated staff. We need to treat all of our heroes with dignity and honor their service through policies that work for them and their families. https://t.co/XlHjrwooNm Need help w/a federal agency?

This isn‚Äôt just about what‚Äôs right &amp; what‚Äôs fair ‚Äì it‚Äôs also about the economic security of Iowa‚Äôs families. https://t.co/XVem2umHJx Today, we sent a message: shutdowns are unacceptable, they are dangerous &amp; they are irresponsible. This is a new day in Washington. We are here to put chaos &amp; dysfunction aside. We are here to do our jobs &amp; we are here to get back to work. #ShutdownToEndAllShutdowns https://t.co/7j04YHDHlN Today I was appointed Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade &amp; Entrepreneurship. I look forward to bringing our #Iowa values to the national conversation about how we move our economy forward by investing in rural development &amp; innovative ideas. https://t.co/c408eoWvEk In Iowa, women are paid 77 cents for every dollar men earn. That‚Äôs a gap of $11,034/year. On the 10th anniversary of the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act, we celebrate the pioneering women who have fought for equal pay &amp; roll up our sleeves to continue their work. https://t.co/v0wWc5SfgW ‚ÄòWe owe it to our federal employees, farmers, &amp; every American impacted by this shutdown to come together w/ a core understanding that working families should never again be used as bargaining chips, by this administration or the next.‚Äô 
https://t.co/caBnBtBnZd Nice letter to the Editor in today's @wcfcourier on my bill, the Stimulutating Innovation through Procurement Act of 2019! I'll continue to fight for more opportunities for all Iowans in Congress. https://t.co/9w5VLCUWsR Wonderful meeting with Waterloo Mayor @QuentinHart to discuss entrepreneurship, affordable housing, &amp; infrastructure!

Whether we‚Äôre talking about businesses that have been in the same family for generations or new businesses just starting up, I‚Äôll make sure they‚Äôre able to grow &amp; innovate. https://t.co/0Niu7sHEIV Congratulations to DBQ‚Äôs Sunnycrest Manor team, rated a 5 star facility by Medicare! These public employees make sure folks receive the care they need in the DBQ community they love. Way to go!
https://t.co/n1sxahCLVt The shutdown is making it harder for students &amp; families to plan. Folks work hard their whole lives so the next generation can do better. It‚Äôs what our country is about. It‚Äôs time the Administration &amp; Senate stop using Iowa families as bargaining chips. 
https://t.co/A8syobqY7R RT @KCRG: Here's a view from a plow truck on I-380 in Cedar Rapids this morning. Be careful as you head out! https://t.co/bvAZgZgFSY Stay safe in Iowa right now with this heavy snow! Huge thank you to all the snow plow drivers, state patrol, first responders and all the many emergency personnel focused on keeping Iowans safe today! https://t.co/DDTCzW5ZEF I was honored to spend the weekend celebrating Iowans who continue Dr. King‚Äôs legacy with their commitment to justice &amp; service to #IA01 communities.

Smart investments in infrastructure create good jobs &amp; help businesses get their goods to consumers. #IA01 can‚Äôt afford C-minus graded roads. Let‚Äôs get to work!
https://t.co/xPgiNRlCuR Thank you @iowahospital, @daveloebsack, &amp; @RepCindyAxne for a great conversation about supporting Iowa‚Äôs health care providers &amp; patients! https://t.co/RecSIukJh0 Such a pleasure to speak with the Commander of the 1st Army this morning! Grateful for the service of the men &amp; women in uniform &amp; committed to supporting them &amp; their families. https://t.co/KfzElaEy6z Walking over to vote with the @DrakeUniversity students who just visited the office! Loved our conversation and a chance to visit with students from my alma mater. https://t.co/TdlBwVqvLV Inspired by the grit &amp; teamwork of the neighborhoods &amp; small businesses in Marshalltown. Thanks to the team at Black Tire for showing me around! https://t.co/5jKc1e9zHO Honored to serve alongside these amazing women! 
https://t.co/4k9Zp1JYdZ Yesterday, I visited Marshalltown neighborhoods &amp; small businesses still rebuilding after the tornado. Inspired by their spirit &amp; determined to make sure they have the support they need to recover &amp; thrive:
https://t.co/TScRGYB533 Got the chance to sit down w/ @RepJohnCurtis to discuss our bill, H.R. 246. Honored to work w/ him to put govt to work for our small businesses: https://t.co/FnpLKKZRdb We can find space to work together and we should. Proud my first bill was bipartisan focused on helping small business and folks in rural communities that are often forgotten in DC. @RepJohnCurtis it was an honor, let‚Äôs do more or this... our democracy demands it. üëç https://t.co/NdIKW9QIoH Proud to have passed my 1st bill in Congress w/ @RepJohnCurtis! H.R. 246 helps small businesses compete for govt. contracts &amp; research grants. 1st bill passed by a new member of Congress this session! Watch my floor speech here: https://t.co/Kxs435r09J RT @tbweig: Iowa @RepFinkenauer delivered a speech on the House floor today for her first submitted bill, H.R. 246, the Stimulating Innovat‚Ä¶ About to speak on the House floor on my bill! Tune into C-SPAN at 3. Cedar Rapids has waited a decade for this funding. It‚Äôs flat-out irresponsible to gamble with people‚Äôs lives &amp; livelihoods, whether they‚Äôre govt workers or communities hit by disasters. 
https://t.co/fo3p7OxAgL Proud to introduce my 1st bill w/ my GOP colleague @RepJohnCurtis to help small businesses, especially in rural communities. Let‚Äôs make sure the next generation of Iowans can innovate right here in #IA01. 
https://t.co/gnMy90B4a8 Our farmers couldn‚Äôt afford another hit after a trade war started on Twitter. Now, they can‚Äôt turn to the agencies that are supposed to help them or get the data they need to plan for this year.
https://t.co/wM6JkOEPyU Proud to stand with federal workers with @AFGENational, @AFLCIO, and other unions today. They keep us safe, help our farmers &amp; small businesses, and look out for consumers. And we should never treat them or their families like poker chips. https://t.co/p0waRfKCkU #TBT signing my oath of office. ‚ÄúI will bear true faith &amp; allegiance‚Ä¶‚Äù Words I‚Äôll remember &amp; act on every day for the people of Iowa‚Äôs First. https://t.co/LF2zPgn97w 1.1 million Iowans are counting on a functioning government to get their tax refunds back. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to have voted to re-open IRS &amp; key agencies, putting money back in the pockets of Iowans‚Äîand again urge the Senate to do the same. I came to Washington to put government back to work for everyday Iowans. That means having a government that‚Äôs up &amp; running while both parties negotiate. Great visiting with Randy &amp; Andrew from UNI! Our universities don‚Äôt just provide opportunities for our students‚Äîresearch at our schools strengthens Iowa‚Äôs economy. Go Panthers! https://t.co/PwMEMZQIfs Honored to share my swearing-in with the people of #IA01 &amp; my parents, who taught me the values I‚Äôll fight for here in Congress. Schools, health care, infrastructure and so much more are on the line. Ready to get to work! https://t.co/C5YvExK0lI
