Proud of the work being done in in Essexville. I'm glad my Pet and Womens Safety (PAWS) legislation was signed into law and is making it possible for their Public Safety Department to welcome pets into their facilities. https://t.co/9q0oxK1wwk I just found a few more photos with Rep. John Dingell. We miss him deeply. https://t.co/23ZxYrML6X This is a clear conflict of interest on what should be a top public health priority for the @EPA. 

I’m working on addressing PFAS because we need to protect our water and communities from these dangerous chemicals. https://t.co/Mwu0iytmSI I heard from @SecAFOfficial yesterday and was assured the Air Force will work with the State of Michigan in regards to PFAS contamination around the former Wurtsmith Base.

Congress must set enforceable standards to guide clean up at contaminated sites. https://t.co/DfTJh7k0ps Chairman Dingell will always be with us because his legacy will be forever woven into the history of Michigan and our country. Colleen and I are grieving with @RepDebDingell and the Dingell family as we remember the extraordinary Dean of the House. We will miss you Mr. Chairman. John was a true statesman: he embodied the values, spirit, &amp; dedication that all public servants should aspire to have. He was a mentor to me &amp; countless others who sought to give back to their communities. I will never forget his wise counsel as I learned my way around Congress. https://t.co/DB0P3Up7x8 Thank you for this honor! I look forward to our continued partnership. https://t.co/LsWXJrxl8E I am urging @BetsyDeVosED to withdraw her proposed Title IX rule and address the epidemic of sexual assault in our K–12 schools, colleges, and universities by listening to students and survivors. https://t.co/Q7d0eitaF3 I'm pleased to announce that @USDOT will award a grant totaling $19.2 million to the @MichiganDOT for disaster recovery projects in Gogebic, Houghton and Meonminee Counties. It will be used to repair roads that were damaged in the flash flooding last year. https://t.co/njgFS39xhR Aretha Franklin was a global icon and fierce advocate for civil rights, women’s rights and the City of Detroit. She will continue to inspire artists and activists for generations.

I'm proud to join the effort to honor the Queen of Soul with the Congressional Gold Medal. https://t.co/QLolenmaQi As Congress works on a bipartisan border security plan, I’m pushing for it to include the most effective and cost-effective ways to secure the Northern &amp; Southern borders — adding the right mix of staff, technology and infrastructure to keep our country safe. https://t.co/chEoDEjws8 Colleen and I are keeping you and John in our thoughts today. https://t.co/phh3L34Ysj Here’s my statement on the President’s #SOTU. https://t.co/2IL3O4yqnz Deal! Glad the @GVSU selfie tradition will continue going strong. https://t.co/MkSA17IItN So fortunate that Dr. @PhillyHigherEd could join me for tonight's #SOTU. Dr. Mantella knows education is integral to the future of our state, and she will lead @GVSU in making sure students gain the skills they need to succeed and our businesses have a strong talent pipeline. https://t.co/WGuva00h27 RT @GVSU: #GVSU President-elect Philomena Mantella will attend the State of the Union address in Washington, D.C. tonight as a guest of U.S… Congratulations to Detroit's very own Rosalind Brewer. 
https://t.co/dgMRXswyv8 I enjoyed sitting down with @Local4News @DevinScillian to talk about my effort to prevent future government shutdowns, #PFAS, &amp; work as Ranking Member on the Homeland Security &amp; Government Affairs Committee. https://t.co/43kTo6pw2T I look forward to @PhillyHigherEd joining me tomorrow for the State of the Union. She was recently named president of @GVSU and I'm hopeful we can work together on efforts to ensure students have the skills and training to succeed in today's workforce. #SOTU Great to be with my friend @RepAndyLevin at his Swearing-in Ceremony in Warren yesterday. He’s going to do great work in this 116th Congress. https://t.co/lkwpkjlVBm It is clear that PFAS are a significant health risk. We have to address it. That’s why I’m continuing to work on this critical issue for Michigan families and communities, crafting legislation and pressing for federal action. https://t.co/LgySQP4LfF The Air Force refuses to observe Michigan's water standards &amp; claim they aren't required to help clean up the contamination. I urge @SecAFOfficial to work with the state and come to Iosco County to meet local families and MEDQ officials to hear how this affects Michiganders. The water around the former Wurtsmith Air Force base has shockingly high levels of PFAS, impacting the surrounding communities in Iosco County.

But the Air Force has not been working in good faith with the State of Michigan in the decontamination process. https://t.co/i5A1NwyhCy Black history is woven into the fabric of America. It tells the story of how far we’ve come, but also how much more must be done to ensure there is equality and justice for all Americans — no matter who they are or where they live. As we recognize this year’s #BlackHistoryMonth, let us celebrate the contributions African Americans have made in every aspect of our society. From innovators and entrepreneurs to scientists and activists, African Americans have played an integral role in the American story. I’m glad that necessary resources will be provided to organizations fighting to ensure that all survivors — both two legged and four legged — can begin a new chapter in their lives. The PAWS Act expands existing federal domestic violence protections to include threats or acts of violence against a survivor’s pet, and provides grant funding to programs that offer shelter and housing assistance for domestic violence survivors with pets. Today I’m at @Haven_Oakland at their new Farber Family Pet Center talking about my legislation called the Pet and Women’s Safety, or PAWS Act that was recently signed into law. https://t.co/bo67YGCaii Whether it’s summer or winter, nothing beats #PureMichigan. 

Please stay warm as we get through this stretch of bitter cold. https://t.co/zZNM0XkpsC ICYMI: You're all clear to raise your thermostat above 65 degrees at midnight. https://t.co/Z5yAs4Id1k The shutdown had a devastating impact on our economy &amp; many American families. It should never happen again.
 
I'm sponsoring the Stop STUPIDITY Act, which would ensure federal funding doesn’t lapse if Congress &amp; the White House fail to reach an agreement. https://t.co/0t65W0bFGT Collecting this much personal data — especially from children — raises serious concerns about the practices of companies like Facebook. Congress needs to do more to protect consumers.

https://t.co/gpFcBzq5Tg In 2017, I was honored to be named legislator of the year by @VVAmerica for my work to ensure veterans who may have wrongly been given a less-than-honorable discharge due to PTSD can get due process and receive benefits &amp; care they’ve earned. 51 years ago, the Tet Offensive began in Vietnam. Today we remember the thousands of service members who lost their lives and the countless Vietnam Veterans who came home to an unwelcoming country.
 
Thank you for your service. https://t.co/Fh5HRB36cs As Ranking Member of the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee, I’m going to continue pressing the Administration to take action. We must protect Michiganders &amp; communities across the country from PFAS exposure. We know #PFAS exposure can have devastating impacts on human health &amp; our environment. The Trump Administration must take action to protect Michiganders from these chemicals. By failing to do so, it is allowing PFAS contamination to spread into drinking water. https://t.co/sP6qmklPHT We’re in for some rough winter weather this week. Please make sure you and your family stay safe. https://t.co/qFEHJxMMA6 Great to be in Birmingham today at the swearing-in ceremony for @RepHaleyStevens. She is an excellent public servant and will serve her constituents well. https://t.co/QWOwFtsPeR We can honor the victims and the survivors of the Holocaust by educating every new generation about the atrocities that occurred, so that they never happen again. https://t.co/5O9lrDJvNj Today on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, #WeRemember the millions of innocent people murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, including six million of whom were killed because they were Jewish. On this day 182 years ago, my favorite state officially joined the Union. Happy Birthday Michigan! https://t.co/Wmd8ZcWtci President Trump should have never shut down the government. Now that the government will be open we need to have a bipartisan approach to secure our borders. I look forward to working in the Senate to accomplish this critical goal and to ensure the government is funded this year. These five public servants best understand the danger this shutdown poses to our national security. We should heed their warning and reopen the government now. https://t.co/V6vZZZ7l8D It was my honor to help ensure he received the Medal of Honor he deserved—he is a true American hero who will not be forgotten, and we are forever thankful for his service. My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/bN80EyCEy5 Lt. Col. Kettles refused to leave his fellow servicemembers behind during an ambush in Vietnam. His actions demonstrated the service and values that make our military great. Democrats and Republicans agree we need to fix our immigration system and secure our borders, but the President should not be using thousands of Americans as leverage while we come up with practical solutions. https://t.co/N5bxUBnkWC Michigan is the leader in mobility—this move reaffirms that. I'll continue supporting ways to ensure our state remains a leader in the future of the auto industry. https://t.co/ZAtzlSSv8r Colleen and I send our condolences to Tony’s family. Tony grew @CGHelps in Oakland County from a small organization to 200 employees and $13 million budget—providing mental health &amp; intervention services that have saved lives. He was a big part of the community &amp; will be missed. https://t.co/VFfm2xyjhy If we had put it to a vote this shutdown would have been over weeks ago, but in the meantime @SenatorCantwell and I want to make sure that no travelers are put at risk. https://t.co/pWSf1jJxcT Today we came together to celebrate the legacy of an inspirational figure, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Thanks for having me in Lansing this afternoon. https://t.co/IYQ54bJc3P Started the day in Grand Rapids this morning reflecting on Dr. King’s lasting legacy. Great to be with so many community leaders. https://t.co/yoUdbmpv4C Yesterday I attended the Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Kalamazoo. May Dr. King's legacy continue to inspire all of us every day. https://t.co/w709Yk9V8O Dr. King taught us that our country is at its strongest when we are united. In today’s uncertain times, we must strive to rise above divisiveness and bring those from all walks of life together to achieve Dr. King’s dream of greater opportunity for all. This leaves Coast Guard emergency responders w/o essential guidance in the event of an oil spill. Both agencies along with PHMSA would have to call back furloughed workers in an emergency, creating even more delays. A potential oil spill at the Straits could quickly become catastrophic. It would take days to recreate an oil trajectory model that achieves the accuracy of NOAA’s Coastal Forecasting System, which isn't operating because of the shutdown. The President’s shutdown presents unacceptable risks to our Great Lakes. I urge the Administration to consider the full economic and environmental consequences to the region. https://t.co/IZ48nUUohr The President must reopen the government immediately and work with Congress to find a commonsense, bipartisan agreement to address our homeland security needs. Fixing our long-broken immigration system and securing our borders are issues that deserve serious solutions, they should not be conditions of keeping the federal government's lights on. The Line 5 pipeline is over 60 years old, and we've had some close calls in recent years. A potential leak would be catastrophic and made exponentially worse because of President Trump's shutdown. Michiganders and the Great Lakes are at serious risk.
https://t.co/ozTVw2HwIc My heart goes out to my friend Candice and the entire Miller family. Colleen and I are thinking of them in this difficult time. https://t.co/nP14xO2Ulp So glad I got to see @LittleMissFlint at our event in Flint this afternoon. https://t.co/AsK5Q5wCPj Even though all the cameras and the spotlight left, we will always be there for Flint. In 2016, I worked on a bipartisan aid package that included funding to help fix Flint’s drinking water, upgrade water infrastructure in Michigan and across the country, and address the health care needs of children who have been exposed to lead. Today I'm in Flint with @SenStabenow, @RepDanKildee &amp; @MonaHannaA talking about the progress that's been made in keeping Flint on the road to recovery. https://t.co/Ii2LB4lA3X Not only are people missing paychecks because of the President's shutdown, but it's also causing huge delays for people like Sue. She should be able to retire rather than wait out the shutdown as a furloughed employee. https://t.co/MEgWpYMFLg On Monday I visited the @NAIASDetroit to see some of the great cars our Michigan @UAW workers make every day. https://t.co/J1xHXtaBLA I wish Satish Udpa well as he steps in as MSU's interim president. I encourage the Board of Trustees that's searching for a permanent president to choose someone who will bring an outside perspective and treat survivors of sexual assault with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/ZRoMpjulpA The President's shutdown is having huge negative effects on workers that Michiganders rely on every day. Our TSA agents ensure we're safe in the sky and our farmers ensure there's food on the table. There's no reason they should be held hostage in this. https://t.co/vcwqb8SBCX I’m glad the Board is taking action. I have long believed that Mr. Engler was not the right person to lead MSU—and it’s been clear the healing process could not happen with him in charge. https://t.co/9kV1LybYJ7 The House passed legislation aiming to ensure Michiganders living w/ pre-existing conditions can afford quality care. The Senate should follow suit immediately. Nicole works at @NOAA_GLERL and a member of @AFGENational. She isn't able to continue her important work because of the shutdown. The President needs to end this immediately. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/KzSrj90ini Earlier this week I got to see the new Chevy Bolt that's made by @UAW workers right here in Michigan. https://t.co/2t89IgiYA4 Check out some of the highlights from my visit to Eckhart in Warren last week via @FOX2News ⬇️ https://t.co/ghfwWKDLNI Daniel is conducting critical research on the risk PFAS bring to our communities, a job that is exponentially more difficult during a shutdown. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/MH0Cy4MTto RT @wwmtnews: Sen.

He sent a letter to the EPA o… Always great when I get to sit down with @SenStabenow to talk about the auto industry. Thanks for having us @PaulWJR. https://t.co/IqUaEJMWMl This irresponsible shutdown has gone on for far too long. The President needs to end this so we as lawmakers can go back to serving the American people. https://t.co/aXuKI0VWWD I’m at the @NAIASDetroit today seeing some of the newest technological advances that are changing the auto industry. https://t.co/n60xrQAX33 I'm proud to stand with our @AFGENational union members who organized a rally in downtown Detroit this week. This shutdown has gone on for too long, and hardworking Michiganders are being affected. This needs to end now. Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of the birth of Motown Records. To celebrate, I’m sharing this photo of award winning Detroit-born Motown singer, songwriter, and record producer Smokey Robinson pictured with a fan. https://t.co/lACY8EsOLX It's official. This is the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States. President Trump needs to end this now before even more people are put in harm’s way. There's no question that we need strong border security, but we need to spend taxpayer dollars effectively. https://t.co/onlzpX2mmz Michigan TSA workers, custom and border protection officers, &amp; air traffic controllers are all receiving their last paychecks today because of this shutdown. They shouldn't be held hostage over a refusal to compromise. I urge the President to end this now. https://t.co/WZ1LxKtpxl As Ranking Member on the Senate's top oversight committee, I'm looking into why park rangers are working at this tourist site in the Trump hotel during a shutdown when other parks &amp; landmarks have no staff to keep visitors safe. https://t.co/vaICSTAh50 There's no question that we need strong border security, but we need to be smart about how we go about it. My bipartisan Ports of Entry Review Act, which was signed into law, ensures people &amp; goods can pass in &amp; out of our country safely &amp; efficiently. https://t.co/KATUe95VSm If Wheeler is confirmed as EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt’s dangerous legacy will continue, and that’s why I can’t support his nomination. One of my top priorities is ensuring our Great Lakes are protected for future generations. I voted against Andrew Wheeler’s nomination to be Deputy EPA Administrator because he consistently sided with special interests over clean air and water. I’ve called for the EPA to take aggressive action in handling PFAS, but we need the President to open the government for that to happen. More and more Michiganders are put in harm’s way as this shutdown drags on. It must end immediately. https://t.co/ScRSJr17UA Are you a Michigander affected by the shutdown? I want to hear from you.

Are you a TSA agent or in the @USCG and working without pay? Are you a Native American that relies on federal support?

Whatever it is, please reply, direct message, or call my office to share your story. https://t.co/B6Qbmi9UuU Thank you to the Bay Area Women's Center for hosting me Monday. I'll continue working with shelters across Michigan to ensure abuse survivors and their pets have the support they need. https://t.co/4nxOGKAzcx The MSU Board of Trustees needs to reinstate the Healing Assistance Fund at their meeting. The sexual assault survivors deserve to know they have the counseling and support that was promised to them so that they can move forward and heal. It is completely unacceptable that the federal workers charged with keeping our country safe are forced to work without pay while the President doubles down on using tax dollars on a costly and ineffective wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. Members of both parties support these commonsense provisions, which were included in the bipartisan Senate-passed bill to keep the government open. Congress must secure both our Northern and Southern borders, including adding personnel at our points of entry and utilizing more cost-effective technology. This is why I authored legislation, now law, that increases training and awareness of CTE programs for high school counselors.

This opens new opportunities for young people, reduces student debt, and develops the workforce needed by our rapidly developing manufacturing industry. This morning I saw firsthand how the Eckhart Advanced Technology Center in Warren is at the forefront of innovation in manufacturing. To ensure their continued success, the next generation of workers needs access to career and technical education (CTE) opportunities. https://t.co/xWTW7F83uO The Chippewa tribe in the UP relies on federal support for health clinics, food distribution, and other services that all have been jeopardized during shutdown.

President Trump needs to open the government immediately.

https://t.co/qtDvAhOUzR I’m proud of my perfect score on the 2017 Humane Society Congressional Scorecard and will continue to work to advance legislation that promotes the well-being of animals and protects them from cruelty and inhumane conditions. Oftentimes people delay leaving their abusive situations out of concern for the safety of their pets they must leave behind. The PAWS Act addresses this by providing funding for facilities that house abuse survivors and their pets. Today I visited the Bay Area Women’s Center to talk about my bipartisan PAWS (Pet and Women's Safety) Act that was signed into law last month. https://t.co/cKgojxapJ2 I met with some of our hardworking members of the @USCG at Saginaw River Station who are working to keep our state safe &amp; secure, but forced to work without pay because of the President’s government shutdown. 

There's no reason for that. This shutdown needs to end. https://t.co/0uIcWgslFM Agreed. Keeping the federal government open is one of our most basic responsibilities. We need to reopen it before we consider voting on anything else. https://t.co/CeZfqmrZU5 I spent this morning with UAW Local 362 in Bay City with some of our retired autoworkers. Proud to stand w/ @UAW in the fight for Michigan workers. https://t.co/umEHG6TP2A This is a heartbreaking tragedy. The Abbas family was very active in the Metro Detroit community. My thoughts are with the family and countless friends who knew them. https://t.co/aOXN2cRoCA Michiganders rely on the TSA for safe air travel. President Trumps's shutdown is forcing many TSA agents to find side jobs so they can make ends meet. The President needs to end this immediately so workers can be compensated and air travel remains safe. https://t.co/K3cAEoGDzu The President needs to end his shutdown immediately so Michiganders can get back to business. https://t.co/4HyA5EDKuz Businesses in Michigan and throughout the country depend on the secure flow of goods and people through our ports. My bipartisan measure, that's now law, will reduce wait times at our ports while protecting against potential security threats.

But the government has to be open to implement it.

I encourage the public to attend or watch it live on my Facebook page. https://t.co/MHQbaZGk1Y On #VeteransDay, we honor those who answered the call to defend our nation. As we reflect on their service, we must continue striving to fulfill the promises made to veterans &amp; their families through access to health care, education &amp; meaningful professional opportunities. https://t.co/dSeLF6Xi6s It’s more important than ever that Congress take action to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. America cannot tolerate threats to our democracy from foreign adversaries like Russia who seek to interfere in our elections https://t.co/kW4JdDzaAW President Trump’s replacement of AG Sessions is alarming. The Russia investigation is about our national security, not politics. Given his views on limiting the investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from oversight of Special Counsel Mueller https://t.co/U3RcE9CgPP Congratulations Andrea! Appreciated your testimony on PFAS contamination at a recent Senate hearing. This is an issue impacting Michiganders and families across America. https://t.co/muBgPGe08G Now more than ever, all Americans must unify against anti-Semitism and hatred. I’m proud to #ShowUpForShabbat with the @templeisraelmi congregation this evening to honor the Tree of Life community. .@InghamISD is helping close the skills gap with career and technical educations that gives students the skills needed to fill local, good-paying job openings. Great to see some of that up-close yesterday! #CTE https://t.co/TVwzYxiWaG I introduced bipartisan legislation to close this resource gap and help further modernize fishery research for the Great Lakes. Read more here: https://t.co/KXECpU2urd I visited @USGS’s Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor to see some of the groundbreaking work to protect our fisheries from invasive species. Despite their efforts, the Center is currently without a dedicated source of funding—unlike counterparts on saltwater coasts. https://t.co/jNHVy9J83r State veterans homes provide long-term, specialized care to our nation's heroes. I was honored to be in Macomb County today w/@MIVeteran for the groundbreaking of a new veterans home in Southeast Michigan. I’ll keep fighting to ensure veterans homes receive full federal support. https://t.co/Lm8gKlhChW I met with @UAW Region 1D members Friday in Traverse City. Michigan’s autoworkers helped build our middle class &amp; I’ll continue fighting to make sure they have the right to band together and collectively bargain to uplift Michigan families. https://t.co/aDYspFq97L The Great Lakes are more than an economic driver—they are in our DNA as Michiganders. Had a great conversation w/community leaders &amp; experts at the Freshwater Summit w/@WatershedCenter in Traverse City Friday about ways we can protect our Great Lakes for future generations. https://t.co/SfidUo1NND As Americans continue to reel from the atrocity in Pittsburgh, my thoughts are w those who lost loved ones. I’m thankful for police who took on the shooter &amp; sustained injuries to prevent more deaths. Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect us. I ask all Americans to unify against this anti-Semitic act of hate. But we need to do much more to help keep Americans safe from this kind of deadly violence. https://t.co/44fYPeLtQ5 Shocked and horrified by the news from Pittsburgh that Jewish people were targeted &amp; murdered while worshipping on Shabbat. Once again our worst fears were realized as a shooting rampage terrorized a house of worship. I pray for the victims and their families. Michigan’s increasingly growing defense manufacturing is playing an important part in keeping our brave men &amp; women safe. Great to visit @PlasanNA yesterday to see their armored vehicle parts production firsthand. https://t.co/QhuM2F4Ye9 Almost everyone knows somebody impacted by the opioid crisis. While more must be done, I'm pleased that provisions I authored with @SenatorCapito to expand access to treatment for adolescents and young adults struggling with addiction were signed into law. https://t.co/V3gf7WtvMq Honored to welcome @USDOT Under Secretary Derek Kan to the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti to highlight Michigan’s leadership role in mobility. Looking forward to years of collaboration to advance safe &amp; reliable self-driving vehicles https://t.co/i53lNslB3H There’s no question the Soo Locks are a critical piece of infrastructure for MI and the country. I was proud to work w/@SenStabenow &amp; my colleagues across the aisle to get us closer to much-needed upgrades to the Soo Locks. https://t.co/gZEoG54ft8 Colleen and I are excited to be at the game today. As they say in East Lansing: It's a beautiful day for football! https://t.co/CRoeeeSBBg Alright Twitter who will win and what's the score going to be? #UMvsMSU Senate Republicans have made their intentions perfectly clear: if they get the chance, they will put protections for preexisting conditions on the chopping block. We simply can’t go back to the days when insurance companies called the shots. https://t.co/bvGVjLBxCR Nothing quite like @MSU_Football vs @UMichFootball week. Can’t wait for the game Saturday! We have a divided family back home but #GoGreen (sorry to my daughter Maddy)—Anyone have fun family traditions? In Michigan we know the long-term risk for kids exposed to lead in drinking water—it’s an issue Detroit, Flint &amp; school districts across America are dealing with now. I joined @SenStabenow &amp; my colleagues in urging immediate actions to protect students: https://t.co/bxdcf5aiZX On #NationalFarmersDay, we celebrate the integral role of Michigan’s 52,000+ farms in our state’s identity. From cherries and apples, to soy, sugar beets and livestock, Michigan farmers feed our families, employ our workers and drive our economy. https://t.co/HnC754MSDJ Trump Admin abruptly removed the leader of office protecting kids’ health while MI kids have been exposed to harmful lead and PFAS. @SenStabenow @RepDanKildee &amp; I demand @EPA answers on how they’ll protect children’s health https://t.co/g3jw4Wki0A The Senate today had a chance to protect people w/pre-existing conditions and stop the Trump Administration’s expansion of plans that don’t cover basic, essential health benefits. Unfortunately Senate Republicans blocked this bill from moving forward. https://t.co/BGcD7yCKGc This was just signed into law! Small businesses are the engines of economic growth in Michigan &amp; I’m glad more resources are on the way to protect their patents. https://t.co/Zf2EP9jAiT Any temporary shutdown of the Soo Locks will have devastating effects on our economy and national security. Proud to work w/@SenStabenow &amp; colleagues to secure authorization for much-needed repairs. https://t.co/Vvn8T3yVwy #MobilityWeekDetroit is an opportunity to showcase the ways Michigan will continue playing a leading role in automotive innovation for years to come. https://t.co/ylPAql093h @KentCareerTech A career &amp; technical education (#CTE) is an effective way to close the skills gap and lead to good-paying jobs w/out college debt. Glad my bill to promote awareness of #CTE was signed into law last month. https://t.co/Q9HFKNkGvk Stopped by @KentCareerTech today to see the great work being done to prepare high-school students for in-demand skills trades jobs in West Michigan. https://t.co/oBxf2G3At2 My statement on today’s vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s SCOTUS confirmation → https://t.co/VQz4sAYLKt "Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation will provide only more division in our country and cast a cloud over the decisions of the court for years to come." https://t.co/VH8EdizqYj “Unfortunately, when I examine the record of Judge Kavanaugh, I do not see an open mind. I do not see fairness. I see a partisan ideologue who will do judicial backflips to rule in favor of large corporations, the powerful and the elite.” https://t.co/qCR0GAF27O Heading to the Senate chamber now to tell my colleagues why I’m a no on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Watch it live here →
https://t.co/Ne9NZWo6zh https://t.co/FtQJWUaPCc I’ll be on @MSNBC around 9:00am with @AlexWitt to talk Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Be sure to tune in! We need to work together to tackle this epidemic &amp; I’m glad the President will soon sign a bipartisan bill to do that—including my provisions to expand access to addiction treatment for adolescents and young adults. https://t.co/hn21oW2RBE Almost everyone knows someone whose life has been shattered by the opioid crisis. This has gone on for too long. https://t.co/eJCY3FA2Dv
