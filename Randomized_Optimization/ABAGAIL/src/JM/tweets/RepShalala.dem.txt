One way or another, this institution has to say to the Senate, and the Senate has to agree, that we will never use policy differences as a weapon to hurt Americans. #EndTheShutdown .@SenateGOP, @POTUS you need to read"Profiles in Courage" ASAP. In this book, I read about stories of people who believed in the institution of Congress. But I don't think any of them ever thought about using the closing of gov't as a weapon when they had policy differences. üîä https://t.co/MPKJF5jNxA No members of our Armed Forces should ever be asked to work without pay.
