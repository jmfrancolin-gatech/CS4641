As one of seven senators in these discussions, &amp; as the Senate Homeland Security Approps chair, I’m committed to working towards a solution. Watch live now: https://t.co/FIyCS9ir3m Beginning in the early 1990s, we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built, those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. Let’s admit that physical barriers need to be a part of the solution. https://t.co/obJZzvtlTX Most importantly, I had a chance to extend my thanks to these leaders and to the men and women of their organizations. They performed their duties w/o pay during the shutdown. Their commitment to their mission never waned. I heard directly from CBP that they can’t do their jobs as effectively w/o physical barriers. Coasties, CBP, &amp; the American people expect us to work together to find a solution—including physical barriers, advanced technologies at ports of entry, &amp; more boots on the ground. This morning, I had two phone calls to ensure I have the most up-to-date information going into today’s conference committee meeting. I spoke with Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan and @ComdtUSCG. https://t.co/EUt6FNhJGG @Peggynoonannyc Country roads, take me home! #AlmostHeaven https://t.co/SOwfh4M60D Because of the government shutdown, I’ve asked @SecretarySonny to extend deadlines for @USDA’s new ReConnect program.

Read my letter: https://t.co/6QcxgcD2L9 As the newly appointed chair of the @EPWGOP Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and through my #CapitoConnect program, I’m dedicated to helping rural areas get 21st century infrastructure. I’m prioritizing broadband highways—not just asphalt highways. While improving roads, we can also improve broadband access with a “dig once” approach. It saves time and money. https://t.co/mZs2BZAZ1D Honored to have been a part of this special day with my friend, @WoodyWilliams45. https://t.co/3RTdQYJaSM Today in @EPWGOP, we’ll be hearing from Nicole Nason, nominee to be administrator of @USDOTFHWA.

I’m committed to do it again. #LetsGetToWork As chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, I have worked extensively over the past year with @DHSgov, Border Patrol, Democrats, and Republicans alike. Proud to say I will be one of seven senators serving on the conference committee to negotiate the Homeland Security Appropriations package.

Listen here: https://t.co/CGFaCskwFB I just got off the Senate floor. Here’s why I voted for @POTUS’ compromise bill. Read more about my vote here: https://t.co/wsnF6mcKHO https://t.co/0ZswcdXagU The president’s proposal represents an honest effort to reopen the government and strengthen border security—a good faith offer that includes both Republican and Democrat priorities. GOP BILL: End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act (aka @POTUS’ proposal) would immediately reopen the closed portions of the government and fund border security.

DEM BILL: Would fund the government through February 8 without funding for any physical barrier at the border. https://t.co/CwXel8HQrG This is one of the reasons I care so deeply about border security. Stopping drugs at the border means stopping them before they get to West Virginia communities. https://t.co/bLUvz6xH03 I believe we should embrace that spirit of compromise to end this shutdown and secure our border. What can’t be compromised is our nation’s security. No one — not the president — not any senator — and not any representative gets everything they want in this bill. That is the nature of compromise. .@POTUS has made a significant concession by asking that we include a provision giving three years of certainty to those covered by the DACA executive order — as well as some who have been on Temporary Protective Status. That provision is included in this amendment. The amendment that Dems have proposed reopens the government through February 8th. It provides no new resources to address the security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Passing the Schumer plan would put us in the same situation on February 8th that exists today. The combination of technology and personnel — both at our ports of entry and along the border —along with the border wall system will enhance our security and choke off a major source of the heroin and fentanyl that has devastated families in West Virginia and across the country. We have 654 miles of physical barrier in place today. If we pass this amendment, we can build 234 more miles in areas like the Rio Grande Valley, where career Border Patrol personnel tell us it is needed most. We are here in this body to work together. To get over any rifts we may have, and to move forward to do the people’s work. We have to fix this situation, and we have to fix it now. We can do that with the president’s proposed compromise. A shutdown is no way to govern. It’s a disservice to our federal workers. It shows our inability to do our job with those on the other side of the aisle. It’s a signal to the American people that we think this confusing and ineffective way to run the government is OK. It’s not. In the past several days and weeks, there has been a lot of talk about who has leverage, who is “winning,” and what the political stakes are. Those are not the questions on the minds of federal workers. Join me on the @SenateFloor at noon today as I explain why @POTUS’ proposal is a good compromise to end the government shutdown and secure our southern border. You can watch live here: https://t.co/BgqBA5qgLD The Homeland Security funding package in @POTUS' compromise includes resources for a whole range of border security priorities. Big picture: Physical barriers are only a piece of this package. This bill is an inclusive, encompassing response to enhance our nation’s security. https://t.co/HAQHdrqCMd 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/BIRKuQEk46 Great talking with the West Virginia Economic Development Council this morning in Charleston. West Virginia has seen steady growth in the past year, and I know 2019 will be even better! I appreciate what these local leaders are doing to encourage opportunity in our state.

As chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I’ve been working with the administration and congressional leaders to come to a bipartisan solution like the one offered today. .@POTUS made a good faith offer that includes important priorities for both Rs and Ds. As I’ve said from the beginning, that’s the kind of compromise we need—one that gets federal employees back to work, ensures our government is working at full capacity, &amp; secures our borders. Violence against women is utterly unacceptable, which is why I have made it a priority to fight back with resources and legislative solutions to support survivors.
