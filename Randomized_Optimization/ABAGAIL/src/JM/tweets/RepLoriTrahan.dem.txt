Wonderful to see my friend @RepAndyVargas in Washington, DC this morning! https://t.co/LJjtVHKCYz Yesterday's #SCOTUS ruling is a temporary victory for a woman's right to choose, but the threat to Roe v. Wade remains real. Too many politicians across the US are pushing policies that take away women‚Äôs reproductive rights. Women deserve better than this. https://t.co/HUImMa2oMM I was very sad to hear of @JohnDingell's passing. John is leaving behind a country that is far better off because of his work and dedication to public service. He is an inspiration to all. 

Sending my love to @RepDebDingell and their whole family during this difficult time. RT @NARAL: Trump's dangerous #GlobalGagRule has been absolutely devastating for global reproductive freedom and public health. Thank you to‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm proud to join @SenMarkey and @AOC as a co-sponsor of the #GreenNewDeal. Climate change poses an existential threat to our country and our world. It is time for Congress to get serious about tackling it. Future generations are depending on us to act. You've heard the statistic: women working full time, year-round typically are paid just 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, and this gap is even wider for women of color.

We can't accept that. We must #RaiseTheWage. 3/3 Women make up nearly two-thirds of workers paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Women are also make up two-thirds of tipped workers, for whom the federal minimum cash wage is just $2.13 per hour. 2/3 An often under-discussed aspect of the minimum wage debate is the role it plays in perpetuating the gender pay gap. I was able to talk about it today during our @EdLaborCmte #RaiseTheWage hearing. 1/3 https://t.co/t58Y9slPwH RT @RepLucyMcBath: Today @HouseJudiciary held the first hearing on gun violence in nearly a decade.

This issue is very personal to me ‚Äî especially as it relates to women and mothers ‚Äî and will remain a top priority of mine this Congress. 1/2 https://t.co/6mSVs999aJ Massachusetts ranked second in the nation for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).

CC: @RepAnnieKuster @SenWarren @SenMarkey @SenatorHassan @SenatorShaheen 3/3 That is why I am proud to take up the mantle of my predecessor, Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, by introducing legislation along with my colleagues to designate the Nashua River as a wild and scenic river. 2/3 Just a half century ago the Nashua River was considered among the most polluted in the country.

While great strides have been made over the years to remove pollution and advance conservation, we've still got a lot of work to do. 1/3

Thanks for having me! https://t.co/Sc6o1Mpkus She's right. https://t.co/mKHVkTloOZ We have an opportunity in this new Congress to be innovative, and boldly tackle the issues that matter to the American people. #SOTU 4/4 Even last night President Trump spoke about history, and not about the future. He lead with fear, and not hope. That is not what I believe this moment in our nation's history calls for. 3/4 Hardworking families like the one I grew up in are still anxious and figuring out how they are going to pay for prescription medications, rising health care costs, and their kids' college tuition. 2/4 Last night, the President took another victory lap on an economy that is primarily benefiting corporations and billionaires -- but not the people in the district that I represent. 1/4 RT @MAYoungDems: Shout-out to @RepPressley, @RepLoriTrahan, and @RepKClark -- the amazing women from our delegation! #SOTU #mapoli Ivan, Veronica, and I are ready to head over to the House Chamber for the State of the Union Address!

 https://t.co/VNKs3zwttv I am honored that Officer Soto and his wife, Veronica will be with me at the State of the Union tonight. Ivan's commitment to service and his community deserves every recognition. 

https://t.co/moya4D0HCV #ICYMI: I was in Gardner yesterday to learn about some of the exciting development projects underway, and better understand how I can be a partner in getting them done. 

Andrew Mansfield from the Gardner News was there and followed along. Read more:

https://t.co/kPWfjPOYRY I appreciated the chance to get on the same page as Mayor Hawke and his team about their development goals, as well as to learn more about the newly designated "opportunity zones" and exciting development projects that are underway. Look forward to being a partner. #MA3 Yesterday I had the opportunity to tour downtown Gardner, MA with Mayor Mark Hawke, Director of Community Development &amp; Planning Trevor Beauregard, State Representative Jon Zlotnik, and State Senator Dean Tran. https://t.co/op55tq60K4 For almost three years, as many as 14,700 transgender servicemembers have been able to serve openly without any evidence of harm to unit cohesion or readiness. They must be allowed to continue to do so. #TransMilitaryBan  3/3 The policy targets and stigmatizes a whole class of people without justification for reasons inextricably tied to their identity. It is immoral, un-American, and flat-out wrong. 2/3 Today, with a great sense of urgency, I joined @RepJoeKennedy, @RepMGS, @RepSpeier, and 160 of our colleagues to urge Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan to refrain from implementing @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs destructive ban on transgender troops. 1/3 https://t.co/jXR6wBCSuO I will continue to do everything in my power to hold those responsible for this disaster accountable so that the tragedies experienced in our communities are never experienced elsewhere. 4/4 As the communities of Lawrence, Andover, &amp; North Andover continue to recover, I am proud to shine a spotlight on Officer Soto‚Äôs heroic actions. 3/4 Even as his own house burned and his life was flipped upside down, Ivan turned his attention to the community he swore to protect and serve. His selflessness and dedication to others is an inspiration. 2/4 I am honored to have Officer Ivan Soto as my guest for the State of the Union. During last September‚Äôs gas explosions, Ivan became a symbol of resilience &amp; courage that our community needed &amp; still needs as we recover from tragedy. 1/4

We each have a role to play to fix this. We must rise to the occasion. 2/2 Today marks the beginning of #BlackHistoryMonth. It is a time to lift up and celebrate the contributions that millions of Black Americans have made to fight to make sure the United States lives up to our values, and recognize those who continue that fight today. 1/2 I had a great time at the Henry C.

https://t.co/CbVGHZjBD6 I am pleased to have played a roll in guaranteeing that these federal employees receive the benefit of this well-deserved pay adjustment. 2/2 Today I offered an amendment that was passed by the House on a bipartisan basis to make sure that hardworking IRS employees would receive a 2.6% pay raise along with other federal workers. Many of these men and women were negatively impacted by the shutdown. 1/2 https://t.co/3iTB4Pvqz7 RT @JakeOliveira1: @RepLoriTrahan Thank you for the opportunity to meet with us @RepLoriTrahan.  We look forward to working with you as a m‚Ä¶ Social Security provides a foundation for seniors, survivors, &amp; people with disabilities.

#FairPayAct #Ledbetter10 #EqualPay 4/4 This issue impacts both women and their families at every stage of life. When women are at the table better decisions are made, and better outcomes are had. 3/4 It was with a great sense of urgency that I joined my colleagues today to introduce the #PaycheckFairness Act, and continue the work of those women and their allies who came before us in the fight for full equality. 2/4 https://t.co/hTno1pUu8z In 2019 the gender pay gap should be a relic of the past. Unfortunately, with women still making only 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man, that is not the case. 1/4

https://t.co/hIKjYKOF26 Of the many shameful aspects of the government shutdown, allowing the Violence Against Women Act to lapse is among the worst. 

Assistance to survivors of domestic abuse should never be used as collateral.

We've made progress towards ensuring #EqualPay for equal work, but Congress must do more to close gender and racial pay gaps. That‚Äôs why I am a proud cosponsor or the #PaycheckFairness Act. #Ledbetter10 I am also ready to elevate the voices and perspectives of women and mothers in policy debates ranging from paid family leave, affordable childcare, and equal pay. Time to get to work! 2/2 I am honored to be joining the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions. I look forward to fighting for better wages, quality health care, and secure pensions under the leadership of @RepWilson. 1/2 https://t.co/oNpzJRvN92 That doesn't even account for the suffering inflicted on millions of Americans. Now the president wants to threaten another one? 

We must stop using shutdowns and federal workers as collateral. It is wrong. Full stop. #NoMoreShutdowns 2/2 The 35-day #TrumpShutdown, which only ended a couple of days ago, caused serious damage to our nation‚Äôs economy. The CBO estimates that it cost the US $11 billion, with $3 billion permanently lost. 1/2

https://t.co/j7XfuLVvv8 Grateful for the opportunity to meet with @MayorVigeant of Marlborough, MA this morning. We had a wide-ranging and constructive discussion about his priorities and needs for the City. I look forward to assisting with the economic development of this community in every way I can. https://t.co/Yn3R0s6ti7 This learning centered around cutting edge advanced manufacturing, precision welding (and virtual welding!), as well as health tech. A remarkable institution, and a phenomenal team helping to foster growth for these students. Bright futures! 3/3 Assabet students choose a technical program to specialize in after having the opportunity to explore and have experiences in a variety of areas. I was able to see first hand some of the incredible learning going on. 2/3 Today I had the pleasure of visiting with students and faculty at the Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School. @AssabetValley provides tools and opportunities for career and academic success to thousands of learners each year. 1/3 https://t.co/bxn65JO0dw RT @RepJoeKennedy: It didn‚Äôt take long for @RepPressley to lead this fight for working families.

Every single one of them should receive back pay, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of two pieces of legislation to make sure that happens.  

It is the right thing to do. While federal employees are back at work today, thousands of lower wage federal contractors -- Janitors, security guards, food service employees and other workers who keep our government functioning -- are not slated to be reimbursed for paychecks missed during this shutdown. Today, federal workers are back at their posts and the appropriate back pay is being processed. The 35 day shutdown was unacceptable and cost our economy billions of dollars. We can't grow complacent. There's work left to do.

We can‚Äôt overlook them or their hardship during this shutdown. https://t.co/dzH160ejgb It is my sincere hope that we have seen the last of using shutdowns as a tool in policy disputes. 4/4 I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to approve this agreement, see it signed by the President, and engage in a debate on how best to secure our border in ways that make sense in the weeks ahead. 3/4 It is unconscionable that that it took 35 days, 2 missed paychecks, &amp; the hardship of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families to arrive at an agreement. The important thing is that we are moving ahead, and that workers will be given the back pay they deserve. 2/4 The path forward was always clear: reopen the federal government and debate border security measures the way our system of government always intended -- on the floor of United States House and Senate in full view of the public. 1/4

Their current situation is no fault of their own. 3/3 It is unconscionable, and a practice that must end. So long as federal workers remain in this difficult position, I feel strongly that Congress must continue to do what we can to help and provide for them. 2/3 As the shutdown enters its 35th day, the hardship that federal workers face only continues to grow. I am alarmed by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs willingness to use the threat of a shutdown as a bargaining tool, and the suffering of federal workers as leverage. 1/3

I am honored to now be in a position to oversee and help expand upon our region‚Äôs tradition of excellence in this area. 1/4 https://t.co/98U1uaE4Gm Despite strong bipartisan support, Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the President continue to hold workers‚Äô paychecks hostage. 

Millions of families stand to lose vital public services if the shutdown continues. We are on day 28. It is time to #EndTheShutdown. RT @SenWarren: A record 131 women will serve in the 116th Congress ‚Äì this is what change looks like.

Proud to be in the fight for Massachu‚Ä¶ That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the #RaisetheWageAct, a bill  that will help level the playing field across the nation and provide working families with a boost. #ForThePeople If you are working full time for the federal minimum and you have two children, then you‚Äôre earning less than $15,000 ‚Äì about $5,000 below the poverty level. We can, and must, do better than that. 3/ Nearly a third of working mothers ‚Äì and nearly half of working single mothers ‚Äì would get a raise if we increase the minimum wage. 2/ THREAD: The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour for ten years. In that time, inflation has eaten away at its purchasing power by as much as 15%. 

As an American, and as a woman, this issue matters a lot to me. It is time to #RaiseTheWage 1/ https://t.co/U4crjrAfza Good to be with two great friends and advocates ‚Äî @RepPressley and @AFTMass President @beth_kontos. https://t.co/3GAnnf1GcW I enjoyed spending some time with this wonderful group of students from @Suffolk_U today. They‚Äôre part way through a two week ‚ÄúInside Washington‚Äù program. I was happy to share some perspective about life as a new Member of Congress! https://t.co/638gPQ6DN7 Make sure you follow me on Facebook and Instagram for more official updates as I get to work representing #MA03!

---&gt; https://t.co/7Iew1rNYKw We also called on Columbia Gas to scrap their planned winter rate hike. Business as usual just won't cut it. These communities have been through too much since September's disaster. 2/2 Yesterday I joined with my colleagues @sethmoulton, @SenMarkey, and @SenWarren to request more information from Columbia Gas about why some residents of the Merrimack Valley were getting large backdated bills. 1/2

https://t.co/Jyakj3qTk2 The Trump Shutdown, now on day 26, is the longest government shutdown in history. Yesterday, members of the Coast Guard did not get paid, marking the first time in our history a division of the armed forces missed their paychecks because of a shutdown. "Viewed together, these portraits demonstrate the scale of the number of women in both the House and Senate. But, when seen as singular portraits, each image represents an individual with her own perspective ‚Äî in political beliefs, personal goals and histories." In the last election the American people sent a record setting 131 women to the United States Congress. I was honored to be one of them.   

The @nytimes published this wonderful photo series to commemorate the occasion. 

https://t.co/gqiNbm58Pg #ICYMI: Yesterday I was honored to have been appointed to the House Armed Services Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues on @HASCDemocrats to ensure that the men and women of the armed services are well provided for. 

https://t.co/an2bUCZO74 Thank you for having me on! https://t.co/bw8HinUIQx We shouldn't have to shut the government down to have a policy debate. It is time for @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr to open the government. 

https://t.co/8qsSEPiewu Today would have been Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 90th birthday. His passion, courage, and dedication to breaking barriers and building bridges is an inspiration. We can honor his life by continuing his legacy and staying focused on creating a more equal and just society. #MLK90 https://t.co/BcPDiSka0d I look forward to being able to leverage my position on this committee to advocate for the servicemembers and their families stationed at Hanscom Air Force Base at home, and the brave men and women of the US Armed Forces around the globe. 2/2 I am honored to receive an appointment to the House Armed Services Committee. There is no greater responsibility for a Member of Congress than to provide for our common defense, &amp; guarantee that the men and women of the armed forces are taken care of. 1/2 https://t.co/CNS8OCCB6O .@HouseDemocrats are doing our job. Now @senatemajldr McConnell and @realDonaldTrump need to do theirs. It is time to put people first and  #EndTheShutdown.

https://t.co/FvIMP4BVtG It‚Äôs time to put people first, get back to work, and end this government shutdown. #MA03 #ForThePeople #EndTheShutdown 2/2 https://t.co/WSx86qiVbs Today I was honored to speak on the House Floor for the first time as a Member of Congress. I spoke about the ongoing government shutdown, its impact on the hard-working men and women of Massachusetts, and the opportunity cost of the current impasse. 1/2 https://t.co/ppGIdHCygu I applaud these teachers. As a society, we have to take care of those we expect to take care of our children. CC: @AFTunion https://t.co/4Yj5DsoN1X #ICYMI: Last Friday I was able to meet with dozens of furloughed employees from the Andover IRS facility. Their stories were heartbreaking, and illustrated perfectly the need to bring this government shutdown to an end.  

https://t.co/Od95zp93X3 Real lives. Real people. Real hardship. 

#EndTheShutdown 

https://t.co/6rZU2nzgsY The House is doing our job. It is time for the Senate to do theirs. https://t.co/MPSNM9WDEA This shutdown is now the longest government shutdown in US history. President Trump has repeatedly refused to accept a bipartisan deal to reopen the government, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell refuses to bring legislation to the floor, which would easily pass the Senate. It's time for the President and Senate Republicans to reopen the government. People's lives are not bargaining chips. We should be able to debate policy without closing the government. #ShutdownStories "We're all being held hostage right now [...]" 

I've heard this sentiment again and again in meetings and phone calls with federal workers being impacted by this shutdown, and they're exactly right. 

https://t.co/GW1vbQBxoF RT @TeamTram: Federal employees should not be held hostage over a policy dispute. Congresswoman @LoriTrahanMA hosted a listening session wi‚Ä¶ The idea that federal workers are "better off" because of the shutdown is ridiculous. This administration is so out of touch. They should take some time to listen to the hardships these men and women are going through. Maybe they'd feel differently. 

https://t.co/eDNxpzYi4j I will continue to support and vote for legislation that reopens the federal government, restores critical services, and makes federal employees financially whole again. 4/4 In addition to toll taken on the workers, thousands of Bay Staters are at risk of having their tax refunds delayed. IRS paperwork impacting loans and mortgages sits in bins, unable to be processed. This is unacceptable. 3/4 ...and some of those impacted were even still recovering from last September's gas explosions. It is time for the President and Senate Republicans to end this shutdown. These are real people facing real hardship -- not pawns in a political dispute. 2/4 I spent this afternoon meeting with employees from the IRS facility in Andover, MA who are furloughed as a result of this senseless shutdown. The #ShutdownStories they shared are heartbreaking. Struggles to afford prescription drugs, one woman just recently lost her husband...1/4 https://t.co/OhtxMRuXbx
