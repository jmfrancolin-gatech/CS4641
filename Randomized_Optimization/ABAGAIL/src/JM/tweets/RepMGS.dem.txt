She‚Äôs leading the charge to restore funding for the Coast Guard. https://t.co/npgd6fTC2l The House has voted to open up the government 7 times. The Senate has yet to act on any of those bipartisan pieces of legislation ‚Äì the same legislation, I might add, that they have already passed.

They deserve so much better tha‚Ä¶ No serious person can claim that any member of this House is against border security. Not only have we sworn an oath to protect and defend this country, but we have voted repeatedly to fund billions of dollars in border security appropriations. #EndTheShutdown What I fear is that this administration and our Republican colleagues in the Senate have forgotten is this: 

This is the people‚Äôs house. We have an obligation to work for them. Refusing to uphold that commitment, that promise, is a slap in the face to the American people. There are more than 100 freshman members of this body ‚Äì comprising over 20 percent of this House ‚Äì who have never worked in a functioning federal government due to Senate inaction. All of our constituents, both Republican and Democrat, are suffering because of it. Today on the House floor, I plan to use my time to share the traumatic impact this shutdown is having on my constituents and Americans around the country.  #EndTheShutdown 

Watch Live: https://t.co/itxqOYYSXr https://t.co/NwUBiwrn4d Today, I will lead @HouseDemocrats in debate to reopen the government. I will be managing the rule for the Continuing Resolution on the House floor as we try for the 8th time to #EndTheShutdown.

It‚Äôs time for our colleagues in the Senate to act. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/hOKqSGuG98 The #TrumpShutdown is the longest in our nation's history.
