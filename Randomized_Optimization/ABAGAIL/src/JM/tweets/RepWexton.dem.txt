The answer is no.

Drop the politics, let's get to work on bipartisan issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs &amp; rebuilding America's infrastructure. #SOTU Hundreds of thousands of Americans went without pay for over a month -- the economic impact of this shutdown has been devastating and will be felt for years to come. We can't afford a repeat, and I will do everything in my power to prevent another shutdown. #SOTU For 35 days Linda and her colleagues worked long hours and long weeks for no pay, keeping passengers safe and the planes on time.

You can watch live here: https://t.co/lbOF2jBR6n RT @RepRaskin: We‚Äôre sharing stories from federal workers &amp; contractors who have been affected by the #TrumpShutdown. Tune into @cspan onli‚Ä¶ Tune in to @cspan online at 10am to hear how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting workers and families in Northern Virginia. https://t.co/Ih6fntJjxF 97% of Americans support passing commonsense background check laws ‚Äì and yet these bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. 

I‚Äôm so pleased to see the introduction of #HR8 today and will proudly co-sponsor the bill! #NeverAgain https://t.co/z9cktk7rZ5 Over the past 17 days I've heard from scores of federal workers in #VA10 who are struggling because of the #TrumpShutdown.

If you're one of the 28,391 impacted across Virginia, share your story with me. Comment on my post, send a message, or call my office. I'm fighting for you. https://t.co/Ot6DKo5Aoo .@realDonaldTrump is treating this shutdown like a game ‚Äì but families like the Caraballos can't afford to play games.

Jessica, a TSA agent, is living paycheck to paycheck. She doesn't know how her family will get by if Friday's paycheck doesn't come.
https://t.co/DCB8Vm5bbm RT @EleanorNorton: On the second day of the new Congress, we got our first two freshmen cosponsors of #HR51, our #DCStatehood bill! Thank y‚Ä¶ Thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, shelters for victims of domestic violence aren't sure they'll be able to keep their doors open much longer.

This a matter of safety &amp; security for Americans around the country. Enough with the games, @realDonaldTrump.
https://t.co/PjnbwuGQBc I sat next to Rep. McBath during the gun violence briefing today at our new member seminar ‚Äì we're looking forward to working together to make our communities safer.

This week we take the first step with the introduction of a bill to guarantee universal background checks. https://t.co/LIGfpDgqBY Kayla is a student, preparing to be an educator. Her husband is serving our country in the Coast Guard.

Thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, she had to take her son out of daycare and is even considering returning some of his Christmas presents.

@realDonaldTrump, this is on you. https://t.co/gavo1JZaiK Check out my new official Instagram account and keep up with my work on Capitol Hill and around #VA10 as your new Congresswoman ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/7EOfpbb0xp It's been over 400 days since Bijan Ghaisar was shot at and killed by U.S. Park Police. The FBI and Park Police have been silent since his death. His family deserves transparency and answers. And we won't stop until we get answers. https://t.co/wbb7R6DXW4 RT @CNNTonight: "I don't believe that members of Congress or the President, for that matter, should be taking a paycheck when so many of ou‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be on @CNNTonight with @donlemon around 10:25 p.m. to discuss the shutdown and the new Congress. Be sure to tune in! I don‚Äôt believe members of Congress should receive our pay during shutdowns when our constituents and hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors do not. So I‚Äôve asked the CAO to withhold my pay until the shutdown ends. #VA10 https://t.co/AUBzValfdN RT @LittleLobbyists: When @RepWexton met Little Lobbyists mom @CFfightermom last year, she pledged we'd be her first meeting.
Today, she ma‚Ä¶ People have noticed the flag outside my office. 

This is personal for me. We're talking about my family and friends. 

I want everyone in the trans community to know that they are welcome and loved even in the face of this administration‚Äôs attacks. https://t.co/M9voVlzi55 I had my first meeting as a Congresswoman with @LittleLobbyists  from #VA10. We discussed their pre-existing conditions and how important it is to ensure their families are able to afford the care they need. I promised I would always vote to protect their access to healthcare. https://t.co/7JGMJwL0Ps I voted to end the shutdown yesterday. @HouseDemocrats showed we will protect our civil servants and their families. That‚Äôs what we were elected to do and that‚Äôs what we delivered last night.

It‚Äôs time to stop using our federal workers as political pawns.
https://t.co/dbpmdTYeaS I‚Äôm officially the Congresswoman from #VA10! https://t.co/mxs7DMcBaD Hopped on a train over to the Capitol with @RepChrissyPA!#WextonGoesToWashington https://t.co/lL01a0SvqY I started my morning with a meeting with my staff and then had an interview with @WDVMTV about #VA10, the shutdown, and my priorities in the 116th Congress. It‚Äôs an historic and exciting day! #WextonGoesToWashington https://t.co/jNsRJ5wNU5 Merry Christmas from my family to you and yours! üéÑüéÅ https://t.co/vbxobROfWj My full statement on Trump‚Äôs shutdown: https://t.co/C86UOQtRpO I toured Handley High School yesterday. Principal @MikeDufrene30 explained what is going well and where they need greater resources. I was so impressed by their Career Technical education classrooms and their historic vault! 

Recap of the visit ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/MPVSLXZ1db https://t.co/OpYxLznM8b I spent my time yesterday over the mountain in #VA10. I stopped by the Inland @PortofVirginia and @Fortessa. I also met with Winchester Mayor David Smith and afterwards we toured Handley High School with the @HandleyJudges! https://t.co/fXq2eIBFqm This attack on people's right to affordable, quality healthcare was brought to you by Republican Attorneys General and Republicans in Congress, who lied about protecting access to healthcare. In Congress, I will fight to protect healthcare for the people. https://t.co/grfy5jMmPH RT @DavidReidVA: Thanks to Doug Kunc with @Equinix for providing me and @RepWexton with an outstanding tour of their Ashburn data center! (‚Ä¶ Bijan's family has now received more information from Fairfax Police (although this most recent one through FOIA) than the U.S. Park Police and the FBI combined. His family deserves answers and I will fight for them in Congress.
https://t.co/EfRIIIcegA I started my day with the @McLeanChamber discussing the 116th Congress and issues important to #VA10, including transportation, federal employees, gun violence prevention, and avoiding a government shutdown. https://t.co/mZDx55Tscu I spent my afternoon at @NovantHealth in Haymarket touring their facility and discussing issues important to the hospital, its employees, and the people they serve. I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to work with their staff come January! #VA10 https://t.co/Sp9DzM30wN I had the pleasure of visiting @GoshenPostES this morning to learn more about the school &amp; its use of project-based learning. I listened to dozens of fifth-grade students‚Äô projects on shark finning and their legislative ideas to end the practice. Maybe one will become law! #VA10 https://t.co/dCIqf7ybom Domestic violence is one of the most lethal threats to women in America. Congress must fully reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and make it harder for domestic abusers to get access to a firearm. #VAWA https://t.co/IXrLdMtHRX I visited @GoshenPostES this morning to hear presentations from the fifth grade classes on sharks and their concerns about the impact of shark finning. I was very impressed by this rendition of ‚ÄúSave the Sharks!‚Äù https://t.co/0OiTqnqOgr RT @NewDEALLeaders: 70 NewDEAL Leaders convened last week at the 8th Annual Leader Conference to discuss pro-growth governing and hear from‚Ä¶ I'm excited to announce that I'll be joining the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force in Congress.
