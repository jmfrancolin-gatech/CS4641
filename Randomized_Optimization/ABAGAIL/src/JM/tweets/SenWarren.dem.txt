A bank teller who takes a few 20s from the bank is looking at serious jail time. But the @WellsFargo CEO can cheat millions of Americans and walk away. That’s a rigged system - and it needs to change. https://t.co/thRT5lTxjX Ready. https://t.co/MI0OgJFZV9 Gigantic banks wrecked our economy, but the Fed told me they are rubber-stamping nearly every proposed bank merger. @SunTrust and @BBT are probably next. We can’t let banks become too big to fail again: American families will suffer. https://t.co/hXTWeGzXgw My heart goes out to @RepDebDingell, and their entire family. https://t.co/PRQfs9nQT1 Kathy Kraninger gutted the @CFPB rule that would stop payday lenders from trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. Siding with payday lenders over consumers is shameful -  Kraninger needs to withdraw this proposal immediately. https://t.co/fdnkg2p8lg If we want to live in a world with clean air and water, we have to take real action to combat climate change now. I'm proud to join @RepAOC and @SenMarkey on a #GreenNewDeal resolution to fight for our planet and our kids’ futures. We have data to determine if Saudi jets killed Yemeni civilians with our support. We need to face the ugly truth - by continuing to enable Saudi Arabia, America is complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. We must end our support for this war now. https://t.co/Thyeejk8sd When I asked the Pentagon last year if they tracked US fuel &amp; bombs used in Saudi airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen, they said no. This time, the Pentagon admitted there’s an entire database of that info and @DeptofDefense has access to it. https://t.co/RMo5i7ITCJ RT @CNN: Stacey Abrams, delivering the Democratic response to Trump’s #SOTU address: “Tonight, we are coming for America, for a better Amer… Ahead of @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU speech, let's list some things we could work together on instead of building a wall. Here's a start:
-Build an economy &amp; democracy that works for everyone
-Ensure access to affordable, quality health care &amp; education
-End corruption in Washington Sajid Shahriar is my guest for tonight's #SOTU. He's a federal worker and @AFGENational rep who was affected by the shutdown. He wants to make sure we avoid another one and keep our government open. https://t.co/K2eoh3gExz David Bernhardt is an ex-Big Oil lobbyist who's worked to pollute our environment for profit. He’s a walking conflict of interest who shouldn’t even be allowed through the front door of the @Interior Dept. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would keep him out. https://t.co/wtiiPb633W Glad to announce Sajid Shahriar will be my #SOTU guest. He's a MA federal worker and union leader who went 35 days without a paycheck during the #TrumpShutdown. Government workers like Sajid shouldn't be used as bargaining chips. They deserve better. https://t.co/EtnraHIAr3 It’s long past time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. And when they return, we need to make sure they get the health care, GI benefits, and other support they've earned. https://t.co/wtur99BpZV We won this fight, but we know @BetsyDeVosED and her cronies at @usedgov aren’t looking out for students. We’ve got to stay watchful and keep her accountable. Follow our oversight work at #DeVosWatch. https://t.co/i3tEGaJcry A piece of good news for students, teachers, and student loan borrowers. This week, I called out @realDonaldTrump for abruptly replacing the top government watchdog in charge of holding @BetsyDeVosEd accountable. Now the Trump Admin has back-tracked: https://t.co/bxt9Nfx5ED .@realDonaldTrump wants to upgrade our nuclear arsenal AND end decades-old arms control agreements. That's a recipe for disaster. Congress must immediately pass my #NoFirstUse bill to prevent him (or any president) from unilaterally starting a nuclear war. https://t.co/3VYxO9ZDC5 We can hold Russia accountable without tearing up the INF Treaty. Withdrawing won't make America any safer – it just increases the potential for a new arms race that would make the world even more dangerous. Coretta Scott King was a powerful civil rights leader, an early supporter of the LGBTQ community, a passionate opponent of apartheid, and a forceful advocate for peace. A strong voice who refused to be silenced. #BlackHistoryMonth  https://t.co/uVydCVRmXs Today marks the beginning of #BlackHistoryMonth, a time to lift up and celebrate the contributions of the millions of Black Americans who have fought to ensure our country lives up to its highest values. RT @riseupretail: BREAKING: @SenWarren has just released a letter to Eddie Lampert calling him out for destroying hundreds of thousands of… Hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers – security guards, cafeteria workers, janitors, and more – missed paychecks during the #TrumpShutdown.

I’m with @SenTinaSmith and @RepPressley. We need to make sure they get the back pay they deserve. #BackPayNow https://t.co/Zb7Mo8gMSB I’ll keep fighting for a world without nuclear weapons. In the meantime, we must take real steps to reduce the likelihood of nuclear conflict. No President – Republican or Democrat – should be able to unilaterally start a nuclear war.
https://t.co/7Y0LBXvIDH The only purpose of the US nuclear arsenal should be deterrence. Retaining the right to use nuclear weapons first won’t make Americans safer. In fact, in increases the possibility of a dangerous miscalculation &amp; puts us – &amp; everyone else – at greater risk of nuclear devastation. Here’s my entire bill on #NoFirstUse: https://t.co/cnicN0FK7l We should never be the first to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict. I'm proud to join with @RepAdamSmith, Chairman of @HASCDemocrats, to introduce a bill that formalizes what most Americans already believe: the United States should never initiate a nuclear war. #NoFirstUse 10 years ago today, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was an important step, but far too many women – especially women of color – still don't receive #EqualPay for equal work. We've got to keep fighting. The ultra-rich keep getting richer while 40% of Americans can’t come up with $400 in an emergency. That’s not a sustainable economy, or a sustainable democracy. 

My #UltraMillionaireTax makes the richest 0.1% pay more – and allows us to invest in opportunities for everyone. https://t.co/I4bzTJAxde Today I met with federal workers in Boston. They're glad to be back on the job (and getting paid) – but also deeply worried about whether or not the government will go into another shutdown.

Federal workers shouldn't be used as pawns in the GOP's political games. https://t.co/JdvBSfhIuq I could go on but I don't need to: it’s clear that Tim Sloan isn't the right person to try to clean up @WellsFargo. His hands are too dirty from overseeing years of scams and scandals. 

That’s not just an “informed” opinion. That’s a fact. Of course, we can’t forget the most recent @WellsFargo scandal that took place right under Tim Sloan’s nose. The bank has been gouging students with triple the fees of its competitors on college campuses. https://t.co/kKrm0u9cXc .@WellsFargo also agreed to pay $175 million to settle claims that it charged Black and Latino borrowers higher fees and rates on mortgages than white borrowers with similar credit profiles. https://t.co/5VKC4DZUex Then there are the 500+ customers who lost their homes because of a “calculation error” by @WellsFargo. And what did Tim Sloan do to make it right? Sent the families affected some inadequate checks. https://t.co/pEAEAhzjt2 Speaking of auto loans, that reminds me of the time @WellsFargo didn't provide refunds to tens of thousands of people who paid off their car loans early. What a great way to treat loyal customers! https://t.co/jQV9lVCMlJ Fake accounts were just one of the scandals that went down at @WellsFargo while Tim Sloan was part of the bank’s top leadership. There are a lot to choose from. Like when they charged hundreds of thousands of customers for auto insurance they didn’t need. https://t.co/NhiizS9hVa Remember the fake accounts scam that got @WellsFargo in trouble to begin with? As CFO and COO, Tim Sloan helped enable it. He got rich off it. And he tried to cover it up. How's he the right guy to clean up the mess? https://t.co/pN4HccGSXv Tim Sloan doesn't think I have an "informed" opinion about how he's helped lead @WellsFargo. But I’ve actually been paying pretty close attention, and I’ve got a long list of reasons why I think he should be fired. (Get comfortable, this is gonna take a while.) https://t.co/zn6N1X2TRO It's time to fundamentally transform our tax code so it’s not rigged for the rich. My plan taxes the wealth of the 75,000 US households with a net worth over $50 million.

Let’s demand the top 0.1% pay their fair share – &amp; start rebuilding our middle class.https://t.co/s2XSz0sF31 Federal workers standing in food lines. Medical care put off. Credit ruined. Contractors who aren’t guaranteed back pay. So much suffering caused by the #TrumpShutdown, and for what? 

It's time to get our government back on track and working for the American people again. Over a month ago, the Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the gov't open. Trump refused to sign it. Republicans just voted down a new measure – so the #TrumpShutdown continues.

How much longer do @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateGOP plan on holding federal workers hostage? Wall Street fat cat Wilbur Ross is a millionaire many times over – so he can't seem to comprehend why missing a paycheck or two would devastate so many families. 

Newsflash @SecretaryRoss: 
Federal employees are hurting. Tell your boss to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/VxncyRbkPi Mayors across the country agree: we need more affordable housing. My plan, the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act, would help create 3.2 million new homes and 1.5 million jobs, and bring down rents by 10% – all without adding a dime to the deficit.

They're fighting back against wage theft and standing up for TSA agents and air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. People deserve to be paid for the work they do. https://t.co/p1cSBNcOG2 The Trump Administration has reportedly been trying to withhold funding for disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and other states and territories.

These are US citizens. They deserve answers – not excuses.
https://t.co/JKRcMe3Yuk I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job. Banning people from serving based on gender identity isn’t only shameful – it makes America less safe. https://t.co/PfASaU6I4C As we celebrate Dr. King's legacy, we must remember: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.

College students. A new @CFPB report shows the bank gouged students with triple the fees of its competitors. @WellsFargo doesn’t belong on college campuses. https://t.co/bE5SvfihaY We already knew that the Trump Administration ripped apart thousands of families – but a new report shows the real number is much, much higher. Separating even one child from their family is cruel and immoral. #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/X3YIsq1hRP The House has already passed legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown, and the Senate could vote to send it to the President’s desk today. Instead, we're voting on a bill to further restrict reproductive rights.
 
Time to get your priorities straight, @SenateMajLdr. A record 131 women will serve in the 116th Congress – this is what change looks like.

Proud to be in the fight for Massachusetts families alongside my friends, @RepPressley, @RepLoriTrahan, and @RepKClark. 

https://t.co/b0OlgJm0Xf 8,200 federal workers in MA – including members of the Coast Guard, TSA agents, air traffic controllers, health care providers, &amp; parks staff – have been sent home or are working without pay.

Republicans must stop playing politics with people's lives &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/T9pwXMmK2a Puerto Rico receives far less Medicaid funding than states, hurting fellow US citizens. I've offered legislation to provide Medicaid parity to PR &amp; other US territories, &amp; called for hearings on the challenges facing PR's health system. This can't wait. https://t.co/fdvM2hcNsT William Barr has already expressed his bias against the Mueller investigation – that alone should disqualify him from serving as Attorney General. He also wants to gut the ACA, thinks Roe v Wade should be overturned, &amp; has a troubling record on criminal justice. I'll vote no. Giant companies may hate my Affordable Drug Manufacturing bill - but I don’t work for them. The American people deserve competitive markets and fair prices. By fixing the broken generic drug market, we can bring the cost of prescriptions down.https://t.co/EkzyZUp8Cq 24 days into the #TrumpShutdown and over 800,000 federal employees have already missed 1 paycheck. 

How many more before Republicans stop crushing working families and re-open the government? Time to end this. Up to 85,000 seniors, disabled Americans, and low income families are already at risk of losing their homes because of the #TrumpShutdown. That’s just plain cruel – it’s time for Republicans to stop playing politics and re-open the government. https://t.co/W3i8cUiH7d Members of the US Coast Guard and other federal employees should be cashing their paychecks today. But thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, some will be visiting local food banks instead. This cannot continue – Republicans must re-open the government. https://t.co/mTpU1qPhTF Mexico won't pay for @realDonaldTrump's stupid wall, and neither will Congress. So now, he's considering using dollars that were supposed to go to disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, TX, CA &amp; elsewhere to fund his political stunt. Unacceptable. https://t.co/dTelEecswk Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist who spent his career helping Big Coal poison our environment – has been officially nominated to run the @EPA.

The House already passed a bill to re-open the gov't, including @IHSgov &amp; other crucial agencies. @SenateGOP should pass it &amp; end the shutdown. https://t.co/6hNDK3rDKq RT @SpeakerPelosi: As the #TrumpShutdown drags on, we are hearing a growing number of stories about how this irresponsible shutdown is thre… No college student should go hungry while they work towards a better future. That’s why I worked with @BHCCBoston President @PamEddinger and my Senate colleagues to request the first ever federal report on food insecurity on college campuses: https://t.co/095FFPOKQV Building a border wall won’t make us any safer. You know what will? Ending this ridiculous #TrumpShutdown and making sure vital agencies like the US Coast Guard, TSA, and federal law enforcement have the funds they need to maintain our national security. American workers have helped create record corporate profits – but their wages have stayed flat for decades as companies reward CEOs and wealthy shareholders instead. My Accountable Capitalism Act would give workers a real voice in corporate decisions. https://t.co/VcevSveeHe Lockouts are unsafe, unfair, and harmful to hard-working families. @SenMarkey and I are grateful that after difficult negotiations, the 6-month lockout by @NationalGridUS is finally over, and 1,250 @SteelWorkers workers will soon be back on the job. https://t.co/vRPaDpQlVk The House has already passed bipartisan bills to end the #TrumpShutdown. I agree with @ChrisVanHollen. The Senate’s first and only order of business right now should be passing that same legislation. We need to re-open the government and get our federal employees back to work. Rent and mortgage payments missed. Bills overdue. Savings dipped into. 

Hundreds of thousands of American families are hurting, and the longer the government is shut down, the worse it gets. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/q2zbdi2JvX Corruption eats away at the heart of democracy. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow will make sure government represents the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/bTtxxPmMwA Residents in the Merrimack Valley need answers about the September 13th #MVGasFires, not more delays. We need to end the #TrumpShutdown now and stop hurting hard-working families. https://t.co/A0n0gsE1Gs Today, I was sworn-in for my second term in the United States Senate. It’s been my honor to represent the Commonwealth, and I plan to keep on fighting for a government that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and the well-connected. https://t.co/RVz2rqB23q Over 7,000 people in Massachusetts have been sent home or are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. Until @realDonaldTrump re-opens the government, I'm donating my salary to @HIASrefugees, a nonprofit that helps refugees and makes our country stronger in the process. John Stumpf eventually lost his job as Wells Fargo’s CEO. But far too often, politicians run our government for the rich and powerful instead of holding them accountable. It's time to end Washington corruption and start building a government that works for all working people. https://t.co/gENQhpC1uL It's been over a week since a vital federal program supporting victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, &amp; stalking expired. @realDonaldTrump must end his shutdown &amp; work with Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act as soon as possible. https://t.co/vUkvUSZnK9 So many of these #ShutdownStories are truly heartbreaking. The #TrumpShutdown isn't some political game. It's hurting hard-working Americans. @realDonaldTrump must end it now. https://t.co/6DobNLLlf8 Our government is supposed to work for working families. Instead: 
🛑25% of the federal government shut down.
🛑380,000 workers sent home.
🛑420,000 federal employees working without pay.

Stop playing politics with people's lives, @realDonaldTrump. End the shutdown. It's time for the Pentagon to come clean. The American people deserve to know the full scope of our operations assisting Saudi Arabia in Yemen. We need to hold our partners – and ourselves – accountable. https://t.co/uhi4WKLD2H When I asked the Pentagon if they tracked US fuel and bombs used in Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, they said no. But new reports show that information was available to us all along. The reality is, US supported airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians. https://t.co/jgJ4qQdoPg The Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the government open. @realDonaldTrump chose to reject it and go into another #TrumpShutdown.  

The American people deserve better. They deserve a government that works for them. Felipe Alonzo-Gomez was just 8 years old when he died on Christmas Eve while in CBP custody. CBP must provide answers about how this happened, and create stronger protections for people in its custody.

We could have funded it, but @realDonaldTrump would rather shut down the government for a wall that doesn’t make us any safer. https://t.co/e4MCTf1wLz This shutdown was completely avoidable. Now, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will go without a paycheck over the holidays as @realDonaldTrump throws another temper tantrum over his stupid wall. Republicans’ latest attempt to divide and distract us. The @DeptVetAffairs should be serving America's veterans, not helping @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies line their pockets. It's time for the @VetAffairsOIG to finally investigate this corruption. https://t.co/cpwKs1qjFh .@USCCRgov just issued a major new report about how the federal government is failing to meet its obligations to Native communities. We must take action. Congress could start by passing my housing bill to help end the shortage of housing in Indian Country. https://t.co/QJUTvHHDiB Ethics officials at the Justice Dept recommended that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from the Mueller investigation – but he doesn't have to listen to them. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would create an independent ethics office to force federal officials to do what's right. https://t.co/ODDE77BhP4 We can’t trust Big Pharma to bring down prices on their own. That’s why I introduced legislation this week to make prescription drugs cheaper, and have a plan to bring down monthly costs for families.
 https://t.co/qX2czEEzxQ Today’s news that Big Pharma will be jacking up prices – again – is outrageous. Drug companies promised to tackle rising drug costs, but now we see what their “promises” are worth. We need action to stop Big Pharma from gouging American families.

None of it has made our country any safer – and neither will spending billions of taxypayer dollars on a border wall. https://t.co/wsaTOHZEZj On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, I’m thinking of Betty, and the millions of Americans who stepped up to serve when their country needed them most. Thank you for your service. https://t.co/5vKj16W51d The US Cadet Nurse Corps Service Recognition Act will recognize former Cadet Nurses’ service to our country and provide them with honorable discharges, ribbon and medal privileges, and burial privileges. https://t.co/Fa5MeUcwlX Betty Beecher was one of 120,000 women who served as Cadet Nurses during WWII. I talked with her about her years of service, and my bipartisan bill to honor America’s Cadet Nurses. https://t.co/C1jPJ0lVBf .@FEMA should be using taxpayer dollars to repair homes in Puerto Rico that were destroyed after Hurricane Maria – not helping companies with ties to @realDonaldTrump line their own pockets. I’m calling on @DHSOIG to investigate. https://t.co/hhUmv4uGtc The VA is supposed to serve the healthcare needs of America's veterans – not the business interests of @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies. I've already gotten an independent gov’t watchdog to investigate, and I’ll keep pushing the @VetAffairsOIG to fully address this scandal. https://t.co/PI3ZV7ytHV Kathy Kraninger has no interest in fighting for American families &amp; zero experience standing up for consumers. The @SenateGOP just voted to put her in charge of the @CFPB anyway.

Kraninger may be on the side of cheating companies – but I won't stop fighting for working families. https://t.co/cAgLIFxJJp US firms shouldn’t do the dirty work of repressive regimes and ruthless dictators. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. If other countries want to make their case, they can use their diplomats. https://t.co/6w2Ce2fAyV Last week, I asked MSL Group and other US lobbying firms to explain their work representing the interests of Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. MSL responded that they’re continuing business as usual and still working for the Saudis. https://t.co/GoW1WoJkbD https://t.co/Bw5zw8CJBU Saudi Arabia used American lobbyists to rent hundreds of Trump hotel rooms and dupe veterans into secretly pushing the Saudis' agenda. Bribing @realDonaldTrump is unconstitutional – but tricking veterans into lobbying for Saudi Arabia is totally legal. It shouldn't be. https://t.co/hMYba3dCR1 My plan to #EndCorruptionNow is the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. @RepJayapal &amp; @RepSarbanes have now introduced it in the House. We're working together to make sure our government really represents the American people. https://t.co/cnHJji18EK We can't lose track of all of @WellsFargo’s scandals.

https://t.co/2BBDupDGiR I'm glad that @HouseDemocrats are planning to make anti-corruption a priority in the next Congress. Together, we can make our government work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. We can #EndCorruptionNow. https://t.co/4bRBnZMM4v George H.W. Bush was an American patriot who lived his life and served our country with dignity. From joining the Navy during WWII to the presidency, his devotion to public service was unmatched. Bruce and I send our heartfelt condolences to his family. We can start by passing my bill with @MarkWarner to impose massive, mandatory penalties on companies like @Equifax that expose people's personal information. We can’t allow companies to get away with leaving sensitive data vulnerable to hackers and thieves.https://t.co/s95R4Do8x1 CEOs won’t take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line. Instead of working to give giant companies like @Marriott even bigger handouts, Congress should focus on holding them accountable for these giant screw-ups. https://t.co/opDufhhLIT It’s time to #EndCorruptionNow. We can do it by passing my Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which was just introduced in the House by @RepJayapal. Together, we can make Washington start working for the American people again. https://t.co/6w2Ce2fAyV If you’re elected to public office, your job is to serve the public. Full stop. That’s why I’m working with @HouseDemocrats and @House_DRTF to advance legislation that ensures public officials work for the public interest. This is exactly why we should require candidates to release their tax returns when running for federal office, and prevent Presidents from owning business empires on the side. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would do both. https://t.co/IOnB9zehDl No candidate should be able to negotiate a business deal with a foreign adversary while running for office. But that’s exactly what @realDonaldTrump did, according to his ex-crony Michael Cohen. This is a textbook case of corruption. https://t.co/NnTNgsPpLX I wrote about how we can pursue a foreign policy that keeps our country secure and serves American workers, not just wealthy elites. It won't be easy – but I believe we can do it together. https://t.co/p5d7THamrr Earlier today, I talked about my vision for a foreign policy that works for all Americans. I believe we can defend our democracy and fight for our workers at the same time. Read my full speech here: ​
https://t.co/eN8yxO4quN Thomas Farr never should have been nominated for a federal judgeship in the first place. @SenatorTimScott's decision to vote no on Farr will keep him off the bench for now. We'll keep fighting to stop nominees like Farr from tilting our courts in favor of the rich and powerful. https://t.co/BitjOhONzM Working families need a @CFPB Director with a proven track record of fighting for consumers. Someone who is willing to go after companies that cheat them. Kathy Kraninger is not that person. I’m calling on my Senate colleagues to reject her nomination. https://t.co/ENHK7AX0OI Americans are an adaptive, resilient people, and we have met hard challenges head on before. We can work together, as we have before, to strengthen democracy at home and abroad. We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites. 55 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke at @AmericanU, he said that, “our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man.” The same is true today. 

(OK, I’d add that they can also be solved by women, too.) The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to @realdDonaldTrump and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy – not without a fight. .@realDonaldTrump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe. And he is aided and abetted every step of the way by Republican politicians too pleased with his judicial appointments and tax cuts to stand up for fundamental American values. Here’s the thing about authoritarian governments – they are rotten from the inside out. Authoritarian leaders talk a big game, but their system is rotten because, by its very design, it stacks the decks for the wealthy and depends on corruption in order to survive. It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds. We must speak plainly about all of these incidents. Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with US values. We must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day. That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them. Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve national security. A 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect, and a living wage, and it would also reinforce US international economic power. A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home. But every day, shortsighted domestic policies are weakening our national strength. Let me propose three core nuclear security principles: 
1. No new nuclear weapons. 
2. More international arms control, not less.
3. No first use. America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy shouldn't be run exclusively by the Pentagon. Yes, we should expect our partners to pay their fair share. But diplomacy isn't about charity; it's about advancing US interests. It is time to identify which programs actually benefit American security in the 21st century, and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. Then pull out a sharp knife and make some cuts. The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security and values should come ahead of the profit margins of private companies. .@realDonaldTrump has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he's more interested in appeasing defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for murdering a @washingtonpost journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons. How do we responsibly cut back? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. It’s clear that the Pentagon is captured by defense contractors – and taxpayers are picking up the bill. Let’s cut our bloated defense budget. The US will spend more than $700 billion on defense this year alone. That is more than President Reagan spent during the Cold War. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now. Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week, including one who grew up in Boston, are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now. Yes, we can – and we we must – continue to be vigilant about the threats of terrorism, whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else. But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war, let’s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security. For nearly 2 decades, this country has been mired in a series of wars – conflicts that sap American strength. The human costs of these wars has been staggering: more than 6,900 Americans killed, another 52k wounded. Many more who live every day with the invisible scars of war. All three of my brothers served in the military. I know that our servicemembers and their families are smart, tough, and resourceful. But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time, we won’t have to use it. Just last week, our own government said that climate change is already happening and will dramatically endanger the world we share. The threat is real and existential – and we need to take action, now. Our economic policies should also address the challenges of today’s interconnected world, including areas like corruption, privacy and data rights, and climate change. We need a new approach to trade, and it should begin with a simple principle: our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks.  That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut. .@realDonaldTrump grabs headlines railing against @GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan – but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change. I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless @realDonaldTrump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families. There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0. For decades, leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts – and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown. Our country is in a moment of crisis decades in the making. America’s middle class has been hollowed out, working people have been betrayed, and democracy itself is under threat. It’s time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. I'm about to speak with students at @AmericanU about my vision for a progressive foreign policy that works for all Americans. Watch live here: https://t.co/wpqQtf4AHJ This is disgraceful. The #GIBill isn’t a handout – it’s earned by men and women who serve our country. We can’t go back on our promises to our veterans. The @DeptVetAffairs must fix this now. https://t.co/0GOugbQxX9 We currently spend more than the next 8 nations combined on defense. But every year, the Pentagon asks Congress for more. "More" is not a strategy. We need smarter investments in our security – and that includes refocusing on investments we should be making at home. https://t.co/RAVntalqSk The death of every American servicemember is a tragedy, but this one hits close to home.
