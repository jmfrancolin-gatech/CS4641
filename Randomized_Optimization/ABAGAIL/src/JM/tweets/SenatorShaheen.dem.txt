Apprenticeships like @ReVisionSolar‚Äôs are part of the solution. https://t.co/k1Qu8tKSLH The ACA is still the law of the land. If you need health insurance or need to change your coverage, you have until midnight tonight to enroll or change your insurance for 2019 through open enrollment.

While we await further rulings on this case, it is important that the public is aware that, for the time being, the ACA still remains the law of the land, and the deadline to sign up for coverage during the open enrollment period ends tonight at midnight. The American people overwhelmingly support the Affordable Care Act, and it is disgraceful that partisans, led by the Trump admin, have yet to abandon their insidious efforts to undermine health care coverage that Americans depend on for essential care. The recklessness of this ruling can't be overstated, as it puts the health care of millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Granite Staters in jeopardy. https://t.co/CKYJkaqn0m Today was a special day. https://t.co/eJP26UA610 Very pleased to announce a $3.7 million grant that will fund efforts in Manchester to mitigate the hazards of lead based paint. The presence of lead based paint continues to pose a serious health threat. These funds will help protect NH families. https://t.co/fNrG5E5VxV Incredible to see @UofNH‚Äôs own Larry Mayer will now join the Nobel Prize committee. Congratulations, Larry! What a wonderful honor. https://t.co/I9UzxJkYgF .@LisaMurkowski and I are leading a bipartisan effort to better understand how PFAS workplace exposure among firefighters may affect the health of these heroes and their families. https://t.co/MKtSr9rvXq Today, we continue to mourn the loss of all the lives lost at Newtown. Regardless of the obstacles, we must keep fighting for common sense gun reform and ways to address mental illness. 6 years later, it‚Äôs still hard to comprehend the horrific shooting at #SandyHook. It is shameful that Congress has not passed meaningful legislation to reduce gun violence in this country, even as many more communities across the country experience their own nightmares. I appreciate the efforts of @SecArmy &amp; @Easter_Seals for their special attention to Mr. Byrne‚Äôs application for a Purple Heart, &amp; @15thSMA and BG Mikolaities for their presentation this morning. It was a special moment to show Mr. Byrne our gratitude for his sacrifice &amp; service. Today was a special day as Francis Byrne‚Äôs long wait to be awarded a Purple Heart is finally over. Fran is an exceptional member of the Greatest Generation and we can never thank him enough for his sacrifice and service. https://t.co/EUcHTdNpHZ RT @MikeCherryWMUR: And right above Francis‚Äô heart now sits the #PurpleHeartforFrancis @WMUR9 #WMUR https://t.co/vOxowpcsSO RT @MikeCherryWMUR: Cool. Francis Byrne is receiving his #PurpleHeart today. @SenatorShaheen called him ‚ÄúAn exceptional example of the grea‚Ä¶ This sends a clear message to Saudi leadership that the US stands firmly on the side of human rights &amp; democratic values. Going forward, there is much work yet to be done to hold Saudi leadership accountable, including measures responding to the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Very pleased that my bipartisan amendment was added that refutes the Trump admin‚Äôs cynical certification to Congress which stated that Saudi violence is in compliance with US &amp; humanitarian interests, &amp; clearly prohibits a resumption of refueling support for the Saudi coalition. The civil war in Yemen is the worst humanitarian disaster in the world and every effort must be made to end the violence. Today, the Senate took action, passing the bipartisan resolution that I cosponsored to end U.S. support for Saudi involvement in the war. Every year my DC office celebrates the holidays with a Yankee Swap. It can get very competitive and cutthroat! This year there was no doubt that our Defense Fellow, Andy, won the day with his Ramen noodles sweatshirt. https://t.co/g5EVB6NTF5 The #FarmBill passed the House and is now headed to the President‚Äôs desk. This key legislation includes critical NH priorities to revitalize our forest economy, invest in rural energy &amp; support economic development in our region. Dark money is corroding our democracy, and the Trump admin is opening our system up to hundreds of millions more in secret political spending. Following my remarks on the Senate floor in favor of a resolution to overturn this rule, the resolution passed with bipartisan support. https://t.co/Gbkht349Db Love this! Thank you @zeus30hightower and @Patriots for your generosity to Granite Staters in need. This will make a difference to so many families. #PatsNation https://t.co/dGUFR5nOTE The deadline to sign up for health insurance or change your plan is in just 4 days! More than 9,000 uninsured Granite Staters qualify for tax credits that could eliminate monthly premium costs. Visit https://t.co/jZzBcoEXgY before midnight this Saturday (12/15) to #GetCovered. https://t.co/bfHIhHZj5n I so appreciate that the Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel Dailey is traveling to NH to participate in the ceremony. This will be an opportunity for New Hampshire and the nation to show our gratitude to Francis. This will be a wonderful event to honor the sacrifice and bravery of a true American hero. I very much appreciate that the Army has accommodated my request to expedite the delivery and awarding of the Purple Heart to Francis Byrne. https://t.co/1dxQ6HRCJU We will all miss Heidi in the Senate, and wish her well in what comes next. If there‚Äôs one thing I know about Heidi, it‚Äôs that she‚Äôs always looking to dig in and get to work to make a difference for North Dakota &amp; the country. I can‚Äôt wait to see where that spirit takes her next. Thrilled to see @NationalService has selected Manchester to host its Greater Boston Area office. Every year I work across the aisle to secure funding for CNCS because their programs, including AmeriCorps, spur service &amp; engagement in communities across NH. Welcome to Manchester! I‚Äôm live @politico‚Äôs Women Rule Summit with @SenJoniErnst discussing how women get things done ‚Äì in the Senate, and across the country. #RuleWithUs https://t.co/AHLP4rKrQY We need to get to the bottom of this and pass meaningful legislation in Congress to address these absurd prescription drug costs. Soaring drug prices are squeezing family budgets and forcing Americans, particularly seniors, to make excruciating choices. It‚Äôs deeply offensive to see evidence of price rigging between generic drug companies. https://t.co/GXskeB4aNL Addressing the impact of adverse childhood experiences is critical to stemming the tide of alcohol and substance misuse. There are far too many kids who have experienced trauma, and we cannot lose another generation. https://t.co/eXype0RSFO This is important news for many teachers. I‚Äôve been pushing @BetsyDeVos for answers on this for months and I will continue to work to ensure relief for every educator who was unfairly harmed by the mismanagement of this program. https://t.co/oJwRGMw9ud This admin continues to downplay the overwhelming evidence about the impacts of global warming on our environment and economy. We need to lead not cede ground. The Trump admin and Congressional Republicans need to take action before it‚Äôs too late. https://t.co/NCsluWUZ0k There are just FIVE days to enroll in health insurance or change your plan before the 12/15 deadline. Today I joined stakeholders @LampreyHealth to discuss tax credits available to many Granite Staters that will reduce monthly premiums. Go to https://t.co/jZzBcoEXgY today! https://t.co/LgMQugdhPD Cyber-attacks are serious national security threats, whether targeting our government or elections. @SierraNevCorp‚Äôs software is designed to thwart these intrusions. Fascinating discussion at their facility today. Glad to see a NH company leading with this innovative technology. https://t.co/UGiWKxZAF2 Francis Byrne is an American hero. This Purple Heart is invaluable to him and his family, and I so look forward to seeing him presented with it in the near future. https://t.co/ZFAPPfZbPK RT @UnionLeader: A World War II veteran from Manchester is getting his dying wish ‚Äî a Purple Heart Award, to be presented at a ceremony in‚Ä¶ Fun to be back @WZID for the 20th annual Christmas is for Kids Radiothon for @WaypointNH! I am consistently amazed at how many Granite Staters dedicate themselves to giving back and supporting others during the holiday season. https://t.co/HWCB21XXqs I will pay careful attention to these issues as I review William Barr‚Äôs record. I look forward to meeting with him to discuss a number of other key concerns, specifically continued efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and his commitment to maintain an independent DOJ. From ensuring the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation can move forward without interference, to combating voter suppression &amp; protecting fundamental human rights for our immigrant and minority communities ‚Äì the role of our nation‚Äôs ‚Äòtop cop‚Äô has never been more important. https://t.co/SKZQZmtm0M When America was attacked, men &amp; women of the Greatest Generation stood up to serve, putting country above everything. Today we remember the lives lost at #PearlHarbor, and we are reminded of the everlasting strength of the U.S. and the brave souls who safeguard our freedom. My statement on Heather Nauert‚Äôs nomination to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations: https://t.co/f5aKXocoUo The Trump admin and Republicans who back this plan to allow even more fossil fuel emissions must have their eyes closed. It‚Äôs time to put science and evidence ahead of scoring political points. Our children‚Äôs future depends on it. https://t.co/R9PMaRbJkn üö®üö®Every week we have more evidence about the devastating climate crisis humans are exacerbating. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to escalate &amp; threaten the world we live in. It‚Äôs past time that this admin take science seriously and address climate change before it‚Äôs too late. https://t.co/f9b99RD7eT This Purple Heart is invaluable to Mr. Byrne and his family, and I so look forward to seeing him presented with it in the near future. I‚Äôm very grateful to Secretary Esper and his staff for working closely with my office to make this happen. I‚Äôm now working with the Secretary and his staff to arrange expedited delivery of this award to Mr. Byrne in Manchester.
