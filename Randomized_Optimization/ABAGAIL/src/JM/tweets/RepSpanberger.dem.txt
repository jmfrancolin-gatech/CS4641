#VA07 My joint statement with @RepDonBeyer, @RepElaineLuria, @RepWexton, and @GerryConnolly : https://t.co/IzPRbsndFM Yesterday, I welcomed the new Indian Ambassador to the United States. We are more secure when we maintain strong relationships with our global allies, like India. In #VA07, the Indian-American community is a vital part of our culture and economy. @IndianEmbassyUS https://t.co/ujPywIpueM During my first @HouseForeign hearing this week, I asked questions about how we hold our security partners accountable for the unacceptable targeting of civilians in #Yemen. https://t.co/lthru3rxYE #ClimateChange has a tangible impact on our national security and the safety of Americans at home and abroad. Long, intense droughts and rising sea levels are fueling mass migration and political unrest in many different parts of the globe.   https://t.co/kBvGiES5EL To sign up for our weekly newsletter, visit: https://t.co/U1hJ5IvRoQ Another week down! I was proud to work with my Democratic colleagues this week on fighting the rising cost of prescription drugs, forming the New Democrat National Security Task Force, and more. To get a full recap of our work here and in #VA07, sign up for our weekly newsletter. https://t.co/6xJqn9NMYr #ICYMI Earlier this week, I ran into Willie O’Ree in the hallway! Mr. O’Ree played for the Bruins as the first black player in the National Hockey League. His perseverance paved the way for so many athletes. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/RJtwvIoLH6 John Dingell spent 59 years in the U.S. Congress proving that principles can transcend politics and that civility can endure challenging times. His storied leadership sets a high bar for public servants. My thoughts are with his wife @RepDebDingell and family.

Despite obstacles, there are many reasons to be optimistic. I will continue to work to ensure that quality healthcare is affordable and accessible for every Central Virginian. #VA07 An excellent meeting today with leaders from @amnestyusa. I look forward to gathering input from many different experts as my @HouseForeign colleagues &amp; I examine human rights concerns overseas. https://t.co/XoHi4VXBQS Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is one of my top priorities in Congress. Let’s work together to confront the enormous burden that prescription drug costs place on Americans in #VA07 and across the country. #EndRxMonopolyPrices https://t.co/1n2mLJ22Hs Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are a financial burden for far too many Central Virginians. No one should be forced to choose between meeting basic needs like housing or having the medication they need to stay healthy. #EndRxMonopolyPrices #VA07 https://t.co/MderjaGw16 Today, we had our first full @HouseAgDems meeting. As Chair of the Conservation &amp; Forestry subcommittee, one of the things I will focus on is implementation of conservation guidelines found in the bipartisan 2018 #FarmBill. We have lots of important work ahead of us. https://t.co/7rOGb34Ss9 Ready for my first @HouseForeign hearing, on U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. You can watch live at https://t.co/uIJGsgxVcn https://t.co/y6ondCrhVu #ICYMI I really enjoyed spending the morning with constituents in Amelia, Virginia last weekend. Mark your calendars for my first #townhall: Tuesday, Feb 19, 6-7pm at the Goochland Rec Center on Sandy Hook Road, Goochland VA. RSVP details to be announced! #VA07 https://t.co/1Bku7MqRkS 17- We must demonstrate a willingness to collaborate and compromise as we serve the people we were elected to represent. 16- We are indeed stronger as a country when Congress and the President work together to move us forward, and our challenges are simply too large to sit idle in our corners. 15- This commitment to bipartisan engagement includes pushing to prevent another senseless government shutdown. I support discussions about strengthening our security, but we can do so without shuttering the government and subjecting the federal workforce to additional pain. 14- We need to focus on substantive, evidence-based policy—not just rhetoric. During my first month in Congress, I’ve participated in bipartisan discussions on issues as vital as the security of our borders and ports of entry, including at the White House. 13-However in Central Virginia, I have heard from many farmers about the negative effects of the ongoing trade war. As we approach planting season, farmers desperately need certainty, &amp; I hope the administration will help provide the necessary assistance to sustain farm families. 12- As a member of the @HouseAgDems, I wanted to hear more from the President about his priorities for our rural communities. In his speech, the President did discuss ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China. 11- And as a member of the @HouseForeign Affairs Committee, I will continue to stress the vital work of the diplomatic and intelligence communities, because I am concerned about the President’s continued criticism of these dedicated public servants. 10- By championing strong global partnerships, we can continue to keep our communities safe. 9- President Trump also addressed our national security priorities. As a former CIA case officer, I will continue to support a robust national security strategy, and we need to make sure this strategy includes working with our allies to promote global stability. 8- While I agree with this priority, we must also protect reliable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. 7- The President also rightfully discussed the staggering costs of prescription drugs. We need to work together to reduce prices, because working families, the elderly, and the disabled should never have to choose between remaining healthy and putting food on the table. 6- Last week, I called on House leadership to prioritize infrastructure improvements, so we can repair roads and bridges, strengthen broadband internet access, and modernize transportation networks. 5- I agree that we must promote job growth and economic development by investing in infrastructure in Central Virginia and across the country. 4- Tonight, President Trump advocated for increased bipartisanship—and I hope he intends to follow through on this commitment with concrete actions. In his speech, the President spoke about the need to pursue a bold, bipartisan infrastructure package. 3- Instead, it has fostered distrust in our system of government—and the record-long government shutdown was a testament to Washington’s ineptitude. The people of #VA07 just want us to do our jobs. 2- For Central Virginians, this brand of politics has not contributed in any meaningful way to lowering healthcare costs, increasing economic opportunity, or supporting the next generation of workers. 1- My thoughts on tonight’s State of the Union:

Across the country, Americans have witnessed the detrimental effects of hyper-partisanship. My thoughts ahead of the #SOTU tonight ⬇️ I hope to hear the President discuss improving our infrastructure (especially rural broadband access), lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and strengthening our national security. https://t.co/SMkSctTHGY Women belong in the House - working on national security issues. 

Proud to wear white to the #SOTU tonight in honor of women’s suffrage with @RepSlotkin, @RepSherrill, and @RepHoulahan. https://t.co/kIaoyscCYM Today, some of my colleagues &amp; I went to the NSA headquarters in Maryland. As a former CIA officer, I know how much goes on behind the scenes in the intelligence community to keep us safe. Our national security is strongest when we trust &amp; value our intelligence professionals. https://t.co/5aouQBs1cU Earlier this week, I joined the Freshmen Working Group on Addiction. #Addiction is a nationwide healthcare emergency, and I’m ready to get to work on practical solutions for #VA07 and beyond. https://t.co/HeFOgFiO1E Have you visited our updated website?

Dowell was known for his “strength of character, tenacity, valor, loyalty, &amp; sense of humor.” These traits defined him, and they continue to define thousands of law enforcement officers across the country. My thoughts are with his family &amp; the @VSPPIO community. https://t.co/GfIDRpJcYo On #WorldCancerDay, I affirm my commitment to ensuring that every person has access to the healthcare that she or he needs - no matter the diagnosis. https://t.co/swRWOoT0g0 RT @richmond2day: Spanberger Named Co-Chair of New Democrat Coalition National Security Task Force https://t.co/16URD37lCy I’m proud to Co-Chair the @HouseNewDems National Security Task Force.

African-Americans have made immeasurable contributions to the fabric of our communities across Central Virginia and the United States. Tomorrow, I’ll be at Hatcher’s in Amelia, VA from 9:30-11am. I hope you will drop by for a coffee &amp; to chat about your concerns, questions and suggestions for how I can better serve #VA07  ☕ #ICYMI Students, essays are due Monday by 5:00pm EST. I look forward to reading your thoughts on civic engagement. #VA07

Follow my official account @repspanberger The 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act reminds us that the fight for #PayEquity is not over.

The shutdown has been distressing &amp; harmful to so many. I'm inspired by the work Feed More is doing &amp; the way people have come together to support others in their community who are hurting. To volunteer: https://t.co/ycV5iMsYwW https://t.co/jlFIcQJycB Federal employees in Central Virginia and across the country have experienced severe financial pain at the hands of hyper-partisanship, and these public servants deserve much better from their elected officials. (4/4) Since the shutdown began, I have repeatedly voted for bipartisan funding bills that would restore the function of critical departments and agencies. I’ve pushed for bipartisan discussions, and today I am encouraged by signs that good-faith conversations are moving forward. (3/4) With today’s announcement, we are one step closer to ending the shutdown. Now, Democrats and Republicans must work together to fully reopen our government and make sure the spiraling chaos of the past 35 days cannot happen again in a mere three weeks. (2/4) There is no question that the shutdown has put our federal workforce, national security, and overall economy at serious risk. (1/4) Unbelievable. “The targets of our investigations now have an advantage.” This letter from @FLEOAORG is troubling.

They were right. The shutdown is causing economic damage and is threatening our national security. #EndTheShutdownNow. #LaGuardia Some people are arguing that the shutdown is about strengthening our national security - but those who know best are saying it’s having the opposite effect. 

This shutdown is a disgrace. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown. 

https://t.co/sLBoLHxVGk Today, #AFGE members rallied in downtown Richmond. They want to go back to work. They want to be able to do their jobs. They want their elected officials to do our jobs and #EndTheShutdown.

Today, I voted to pass two bipartisan bills that would reopen the USDA, the FDA, the Dept. of Transportation, &amp; HUD—and provide much-needed certainty to their employees and their families. https://t.co/pAMu5ywdLu RT @RepDerekKilmer: I just voted on bipartisan bills that would help #endtheshutdown and get folks in our neck of the woods back to work.

I shared the story of a Central Virginian who is concerned about the shutdown &amp; its harmful impacts on her family—and I called for our elected officials to work together in a bipartisan way to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/AllnUEasFr RT @SenDuckworth: Enjoyed having lunch with these inspiring public servants who have protected our nation and I'm excited to work with them… One week in: A group of freshman House Members—with national security backgrounds—doing a little orienteering in the tunnels. Grateful to join @RepElaineLuria, @RepHoulahan, and @RepSlotkin for a wonderful lunch with @SenDuckworth over on the Senate side. https://t.co/Nvgygk2bSx Thank you to @NATCA for discussing the shutdown’s impacts on those who keep our flights running smoothly and our skies safe. This shutdown could cause lasting impacts on the U.S. airspace system, and we need to #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/r5TUYqC6ou Thank you to @NBC12 and @alana_austin for interviewing me about the shutdown’s harmful impacts on the 7th District and my efforts to reopen our government. We need to work together to end this shutdown now. https://t.co/acKeBMRmhJ As the shutdown drags on, hyper-partisanship is hurting hundreds of thousands of federal workers, including those who keep American families safe. Earlier, I spoke with @craigmelvin about how our government needs to do the right thing and reopen now. https://t.co/GbcrLbX9x9 For soybean growers across Central VA, the administration's trade war has been harmful. But now with the current closure of key USDA offices, they face even further uncertainty. #EndTheShutdown 

https://t.co/iejeG98me2 About to discuss the ongoing government shutdown with @craigmelvin on @MSNBC https://t.co/r86DSqbXg0 Real people are suffering because of the shutdown. We must fund the government to ensure our national security, and then discuss how to further secure our borders and ports of entry. #EndTheShutdown

https://t.co/oTQmDFS7Px My thoughts on the President's address: https://t.co/sr2eW9VkFo Thank you, @GabbyGiffords. After too many gun-related tragedies, we are long overdue for effective gun safety reforms. And today marks crucial, bipartisan progress as we work to improve universal background checks and keep our homes, neighborhoods, and schools safe. https://t.co/EOgi5pC7y0 Hardworking federal employees and their families deserve their salaries. And if we’re willing to put their salaries on the table, I think Members of Congress should be willing to put their own salaries on the table as well. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/HvzpECKpQd RT @benyc: .@RepSpanberger has signed on to bills from @RepDonBeyer that would retroactively pay federal employees after shutdown, and @Rep… I've heard from many in Central VA who face growing uncertainty due to the shutdown.

As I told @WTOP, we've heard stories about situations where spouses are changing their retirement contributions so that they have a little bit more money coming in.

https://t.co/fQnU5NvnAP Last week, I sent a letter requesting that my federal salary be withheld until the government is fully reopened. It is our job to keep the government funded, and now end this shutdown, and we shouldn't get paid until we do. https://t.co/uDQ7xLZeFy And H.R. 211, led by @RepSchrader, would reduce the rate of pay for Members of Congress if a shutdown occurs— because if the House, in concert with the Senate and POTUS, cannot keep our government open, officials shouldn’t expect a full taxpayer-funded paycheck until they do. H.R. 67, led by @RepDonBeyer, is a bipartisan bill that would require that federal employees unpaid during the shutdown would receive their pay once the shutdown ends. The havoc caused by the shutdown is bad enough, but ensuring federal employees receive their salaries is vital. These two bills would make sure: 

1. Federal workers receive backpay once the shutdown ends, and 

2. Member of Congress don't receive their regular salaries in a shutdown. And because I feel strongly that federal employees and the very function of our government should not be bargaining chips, on my first day in Congress, I also co-sponsored two bills that would help address this increasingly serious situation. On my first day in Congress, I voted for, and the House passed, legislation with bipartisan support that would have funded the government and ended the shutdown, but so far, the Senate will not take it up. The shutdown continues to wreak havoc on our security, economy, federal employees, and government services— and it's unacceptable.

https://t.co/NL0rOm24Zu Thank you to all old &amp; new friends who made the drive yesterday to share their warm wishes on my first day in our office.
