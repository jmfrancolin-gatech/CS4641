As President Ronald Reagan said that day,‚Ä¶ I filed the Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act to cut federal funding from any state/municipality that allows noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote. More &amp; more of these initiatives are popping up across the country, so we must keep working to push this bill. These dangerous &amp; egregious policies are allowing the voice of the American citizen to be watered down at the voting booth, &amp; I believe we must fight to protect the integrity of our elections &amp; the value of American citizenship. Too many liberal communities are beginning to allow noncitizens &amp; illegal immigrants the sacred right to vote in local elections as part of their open borders agenda. Today, it‚Äôs local elections ‚Äì next, it could be state or nationwide elections. Even though the House is now led by Nancy Pelosi &amp; open border Democrats, I will never stop fighting to make our country safe for all Americans. This starts by ensuring federal dollars are restricted from jurisdictions that have no respect for our nation‚Äôs laws. Sanctuary cities foster &amp; encourage illegal activity which poses a great danger to American citizens. Congress must do all it can to defund &amp; crack down on these jurisdictions that encourage illegal behavior, &amp; my bill will do just that. Along w/ securing our porous southern border &amp; building the wall, we must continue to work to defund dangerous sanctuary cities, which is why I have introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act.
