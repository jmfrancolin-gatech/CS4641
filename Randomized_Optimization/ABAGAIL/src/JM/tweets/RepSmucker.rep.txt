@RepJohnCurtis @RodneyDavis @RepBobGibbs @RepKinzinger @RepStefanik @RepFredUpton @RepJohnKatko @RepBalderson @JeffFortenberry @RepJenniffer Read more about how we can end governing by crisis by preventing government shutdowns  👇

https://t.co/W1e7wAAUI7 The idea behind my bill is simple: put more pressure on Congress to actually do its job. 

It’s our basic constitutional duty to reach solutions and keep the government open. That’s our job. 

Let’s work together to make sure we don’t find ourselves in this place again. We’re all now familiar with what a shutdown means:

-Limited access &amp; strained service from the USDA for SNAP benefits 
-More TSA workers calling out sick because they worked without being paid 
-No funding
-No progress 

That’s why we must do all we can to #PreventGovtShutdowns https://t.co/8ttHh5I92m In Lancaster speaking about preventing government shutdowns with @SenToomey and @CommissionerJP.

I hope they make good on their word. We need to solve this problem because it’s our job. The American people are counting on us. Over the next few weeks, we have a great opportunity to address border security. Walls work. They’re a critical part of the solution for our immigration problem. We need a wall to keep our borders safe and lessen the drugs flowing into our country over our Southern border. I am glad the federal government is going to reopen and our 800,000 furloughed workers will be paid. As I’ve said before, shutting down our government isn’t an effective way to legislate. Huge congrats to the @ManheimFFA on their Best in Show win at the #PAFarmShow! 🏆https://t.co/GVku0UDqnB Democrats' biggest talking point during this shutdown has been the 800,000 federal employees working without pay.

Republicans have made numerous commonsense, reasonable offers to Democrats which would have kept the government open and properly funded but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would rather play partisan games and put politics ahead of national security.
