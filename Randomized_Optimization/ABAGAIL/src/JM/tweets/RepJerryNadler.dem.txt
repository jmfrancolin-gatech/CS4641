A knock against Mr. Barr‚Äôs nomination for Attorney General, for sure. https://t.co/1AfdI6S2Wz You can be sure that, beginning in January, this Committee intends to do its job, in a fair, but firm, manner. The time for zero accountability is over, and we are determined to ensure that @DHSgov‚Äôs policies and practices are aligned with the laws and values of the nation. We must also conduct much-needed oversight over the disastrous family separation policy. Not only was the policy abhorrent, it is clear that DHS was either incompetent, or grossly negligent, in its implementation, which only compounded the trauma inflicted on innocent children. The Administration‚Äôs dangerous and chaotic policies have caused desperate people to use desperate means to find protection for themselves and for their children. The fact that U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection does not conduct a full medical examination of people it holds in its custody is outrageous and is a policy that should be changed today. As we move into the next Congress, I want to put you and your department on notice: the time for accountability has arrived.
