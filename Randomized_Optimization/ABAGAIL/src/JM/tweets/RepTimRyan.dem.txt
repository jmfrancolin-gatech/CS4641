Looking for leadership. Climate change is an existential threat. Hurricanes, wildfires and floods are threatening the lives of people across the country.

We can put that money to integrate technology on our border, increase security at our ports of entry, and update existing structures. But taxpayers are not going to foot the bill for a vanity project. In 2016, the President came to my district and promised manufacturing jobs would come back. Two years later, GM announced it would close five facilities, including the one in Lordstown. They deserve better than empty, failed promises. #SOTU https://t.co/FZG3JxSYz7 This deserves more attention. GM has started its first round of layoffs. These dedicated, hard-working employees don't deserve to get a pink slip. They've helped build GM up and stood by them through thick and thin. It's time GM does the same. The lack of accountability from this Administration is appalling. They separated thousands of families and have no way of reuniting them.

And this Friday, hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans won't be receiving their paycheck. The Senate needs to vote on the House legislation today. https://t.co/FlRoT09Heh House Democrats passed legislation last week to end the government shutdown, the same legislation the Senate passed unanimously just a few weeks ago. It’s time for Republicans to end their political games and reopen the government. https://t.co/gSvsnvRUTu Our citizens are served by the men and women in our federal corrections system. They work hard in dangerous jobs. Trump’s government shutdown is terrible. And for the President to give his top people a pay raise while these workers are not getting paid is a slap in the face. https://t.co/4PBj2MTu9K Another huge step toward bringing TJX to the Mahoning Valley. https://t.co/PEyOQ9HfV9 President Trump cares more about Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham than the American people. https://t.co/1FKonCKqZA You would think that someone in a position titled "Senate Majority Leader" would be actively working to reopen the government. Instead, McConnell is standing on the side lines and allowing the President to hold our country hostage. Shameful. https://t.co/u6x31JKtvP We come to DC to serve our constituents. But in the past 2 years, we've seen lawmakers stray away from that standard. It's time that our democracy and legislators start working #ForThePeople. It's why I'm proud to be a cosponsor of #HR1: For The People Act https://t.co/6Yc0nTnE7l The legislation Sen. Mitch McConnell is now rejecting already passed the Senate unanimously last month. Make no mistake, he is putting party over country. https://t.co/DXt0skTngm This evening, House Democrats took the first step to ending the Trump shutdown and passed government funding legislation. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same. We need to end this government shutdown now. https://t.co/iDq36eJciH RT @hardball: "Let the experts tell us. There are Republican Senators on border states who don't want a wall." @RepTimRyan on the governmen… It’s an honor and privilege to continue serving Ohio’s 13th District. I look forward to the next two years as we move our nation forward and help families in the Mahoning Valley, all across Ohio, and the United States. #116thCongress https://t.co/uTNlRpwnp7 As Donald Trump continues his presidential tantrum over an ineffective and unnecessary wall, more GM jobs are being lost. He's yet to provide a real solution to bring back the jobs he's promised. We need a national manufacturing policy now. https://t.co/vGM30mrbfA As we begin the #116thCongress, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that no American is left behind and work together to solve our nation’s problems, while at the same time preforming Congress’ Constitutional duty to act as a check on the Executive Branch. Let's get to work! We're dealing with a President who's focused more on appealing to right-wing television and radio hosts than working for the American people. https://t.co/YeVwamhzSU .@AFGENational: "Our members put their lives on the line to keep our country safe. Requiring them to work without pay is nothing short of inhumane." https://t.co/VZ8LLw40yZ Democrats are ready to reopen the government. Will Republicans join us or continue to enable the President's tantrum? https://t.co/5d9QVJYzFT RT @Morning_Joe: Coming up: @RepTimRyan https://t.co/rpCUFbFX84 That’s how it’s done. Starting off 2019 as Rose Bowl Champions! Congratulations Buckeyes! O-H! https://t.co/Oj0tqKjjhO Wishing you and your family a happy and healthy new year! 🎉 Brady had some great ideas on how to spend a 40 and sunny December day in Ohio! https://t.co/MVNiMvKRa2 Hundreds of thousands of American workers are being thrown into financial uncertainty. Their livelihood is on the line. Republicans and President Trump need to stop playing political games. End this shutdown today. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/7HQXWaVJ8H Merry Christmas! 🎄 Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They can end this shutdown today. But on Christmas Eve, they’re choosing to hold our country hostage and put politics over people. We don’t need a wall. We need to reopen the government. This isn’t news to us! #UnionStrong https://t.co/EqDSMtU1FB Republicans talk a big game about putting the American people first. Yet 400,000 Americans won’t be getting a paycheck this holiday season because of their shutdown — while Congressional Republicans are still paying themselves. This isn’t a party that leads, it’s a party of chaos President Trump is reckless. His impulsive, petty tendencies make us all less safe. https://t.co/d7cksVkDdK RT @ChrisMurphyCT: Uhhhh...you don’t know your own coordinator of the anti-ISIS campaign?

Over the past 5 years, no one has done more to p… Thanks to Dante the cameraman for letting Brady give it a try. He had a ball. https://t.co/8qjhh4Ar5e This is reckless and harms women all across Ohio. Republicans need to stop these attacks on reproductive rights. https://t.co/IhdCcezP4j This shutdown can end right now. But the President and Republicans decided to play games with hundreds of thousands of federal jobs for an ineffective wall. It’s insulting to the hard-working men and women who help run our country every day. They deserve better. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/6BU8FJ5Hpq As @realDonaldTrump emphatically told us last week from the Oval Office, this shut down is on him. It is entirely in the President and Congressional Republicans’ power to end this tantrum and fulfill the original agreement that was set to pass overwhelmingly. 3/3 Once again we are in the midst of a government shutdown brought about by their own internal squabbles and backwards priorities. They are beholden to far-right talking heads instead of the American people who elected them. 2/3 The GOP has mastered the art of winning elections by fear-mongering, but it is abundantly clear they have yet to master the art of governing the country. 1/3

Gran… @JuanSaaa Sometimes I get a little animated! #ICYMI: Yesterday I was proud to vote in favor of the #FirstStepAct. The bill is exactly what it sounds like: a first step towards truly reforming our broken and all-too-often discriminatory criminal justice system. https://t.co/co8KmqSJl4 RT @SherrodBrown: Nearly 80% of Americans. https://t.co/RBIUC9aXNP My thoughts are with Justice Ginsburg and her family as she recovers from this procedure. https://t.co/Vh93HaQLsC Nope! Not how this works. https://t.co/pJVkqbyw2B It doesn't matter who you voted for. Secretary Mattis's resignation is a serious thing. The issues he laid out in his letter should concern us all. This Congress must hold the President accountable.  

https://t.co/ggVjH3jDsu I have some thoughts about this looming shutdown... https://t.co/XQfEwlMHst RT @AppropsDems: .@RepTimRyan: Everywhere he went on the campaign trail, President Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the border wall… Fair and impartial justice is a moral imperative and the great unfinished work of achieving full civil rights for every citizen. I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation today to advance the cause of justice. 3/3 For too long our justice system has disproportionately targeted people of color and trapped low-income Americans into a cycle of debt and incarceration. Unrigging this system will take time, but we must fight every day to ensure it takes as little time as possible. 2/3
