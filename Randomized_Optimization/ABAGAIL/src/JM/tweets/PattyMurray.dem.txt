But if the Texas lawsuit his administration stands behind goes into effect, children w/ cancer would lose protection for their pre-existing conditions. People who've gained coverage under Medicaid‚Äîwhich is a critical source of coverage for those w/ HIV‚Äîwould lose their insurance. The most urgent step we can take right now to help children battling cancer, and help those struggling with HIV, is to make absolutely sure their health care coverage isn‚Äôt taken away.

https://t.co/MxllrdBKLu Today starts an 8-month extension of the active duty deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border. President Trump is using troops as a political prop. This is wrong and cannot go unanswered. Democrats have made it clear that we don‚Äôt support using taxpayer dollars to pay for President Trump's wasteful wall‚Äîbut we‚Äôve also made it clear that we're willing to continue working with Republicans on responsible border security. 
https://t.co/Yhzf19Eob8 I agree with my colleague Rep. @rosadelauro‚Äîthe #PaycheckFairness Act is "long overdue." With women only making 80 cents for every dollar that men make in our country, it's PAST TIME that women receive #EqualPay for equal work.
https://t.co/J0wWVdjOL8 Proud to introduce the #PaycheckFairness Act, which will reaffirm that every worker in America has the right to receive #EqualPay for equal work. Pleased my House colleagues are making this bill a priority and I hope we can do the same in the Senate. 
https://t.co/krNDfbkEjS Democrats have made it CLEAR that we:

- are willing to work with Republicans on responsible border security 

I urge the president to work with us on actual solutions and NOT shut down the government if he doesn‚Äôt get his way in a few weeks. There is no threat that justifies this misuse of our military. It is a politically-motivated step that turns US troops into a political prop. This is wrong and cannot go unanswered. https://t.co/yxKbS6TTGp "We cannot subject another generation of women to this injustice." - @Lilly_Ledbetter

Grateful to have worked with Rep. @rosadelauro on the #PaycheckFairness Act, which will reaffirm that every worker in America has the right to receive #EqualPay for equal work.

The level of chaos and dysfunction the American people were forced to deal with during the #TrumpShutdown was truly appalling and has absolutely no place in the United States of America. It‚Äôs clear we need to do more to provide stability for our communities and the health centers they depend on, which is why I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to provide 5 years of stable funding for community health centers. https://t.co/Llh1SRZvXO In Ferry County, the funding uncertainty left a center unable to sign annual contracts for needed medical staff and managers. Meanwhile, in Yakima, clinics in some of our most vulnerable communities were at risk of closing. This time last year in Spokane, in Whatcom County, and on the Olympic Peninsula, new services and expansion plans to address communities‚Äô health needs were jeopardized by the funding freeze community health centers faced. I remember all too well the challenges our community health centers faced a year ago. They were left waiting for Congress to extend funding for programs that support them and their staff, and give patients access to the care they rely on. We must do better.
