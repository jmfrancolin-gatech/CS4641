Did Liberals in New York just legalize abortion-on-demand up until the moment of birth? #TheyFeelPain #ProLife https://t.co/iyG9uosnFw It’s an honor to be selected to serve on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I fought and served my country as a U.S. Marine, and I look forward to continuing my service in this important role. 🇺🇸 @HouseForeignGOP https://t.co/23BPeOpxEj President @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP have offered multiple deals that secures the border, addresses the humanitarian crisis, and pays federal workers. I will continue to urge @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats to negotiate in good faith. Enough is enough. While Democrat Party leadership continues to play political games w/ border security, the opioid crisis and our federal workers; House Republicans are committed to REAL ACTION. I urge @SpeakerPelosi and Democrats to negotiate in good faith, secure the border and end the shutdown. https://t.co/MjFCqUggQH President @realDonaldTrump put forward a serious and reasonable offer to secure our border and reopen government. @SpeakerPelosi and Democrat Party leadership should negotiate in good faith. Offering $1 for border security is not serious, it's insulting to the American people. We look forward to serving the Sixth District on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As the Crossroads of America, Indiana will continue to lead! @TransportGOP 🇺🇸 https://t.co/12tuVKEisF Today, we honored the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—a great American hero who fought for equality and justice for all Americans—during the 22nd Annual #MLKDay Community Breakfast in Columbus. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/hGyvxHJr6p Over 100,000 Americans marched on Washington in support of life.

Indiana is the Crossroads of America and I look forward to serving the people of Indiana's Sixth District! @TransportGOP 🇺🇸 https://t.co/JooTok0Sn1 .@GovHolcomb delivered a strong State of the State address last night, where he highlighted a main part of his public health goal: addressing Indiana's opioid crisis. Enough is enough. We must act. #INSOTS https://t.co/gFvzDcFeC1 Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat Party leadership are more interested in political games than actual solutions. Democrats made this clear today by declining an invite by @POTUS (@realDonaldTrump) to discuss border security and ending the shutdown. Shameful. https://t.co/szI1Rr3guQ Treasurer of State Kelly Mitchell (@TOS_Mitchell), Auditor of State Tera Klutz (@IN_Auditor), and Secretary of State Connie Lawson (@SecretaryLawson)—three tremendous public servants—took their oaths of office, yesterday!

👉38% increase in methamphetamine

Democrats are refusing to negotiate in good faith. This isn't a partisan issue. It's a crisis. There were 794 opioid-related overdose deaths­­­ in Indiana in 2016 w/ a large increase in heroin-related deaths: 114 in 2012 - 297 in 2016. https://t.co/u5Y0wO2b1Q RT @therepublicnews: Rep. Pence supports border wall; declines pay during shutdown  https://t.co/85Q4rvvaki The House just passed S. 24 (Government Employee Fair Treatment Act) which guarantees back-pay to federal employees affected by the shutdown. Federal employees and their families shouldn't lose their paychecks because Democrat Party leadership refuses to negotiate in good faith. I've met w/ sheriffs and the DEA. The opioid crisis is being fueled by fentanyl and other drugs and products coming from the southern border. The humanitarian crisis in the 6th District is the deaths and damage to families and communities. @therepublicnews https://t.co/O7z39RwYLB The people of the Sixth District sent me to Washington to secure the border. This isn't a partisan issue. It's common sense. @therepublicnews https://t.co/keafoNnwKD Despite the shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive pay. I’m suspending my pay until Congress does its job. I was sent to Washington to secure the border and make government work. I support the president’s proposal to secure the border and it’s time for Congress to act. https://t.co/3ywjBbuqvo
