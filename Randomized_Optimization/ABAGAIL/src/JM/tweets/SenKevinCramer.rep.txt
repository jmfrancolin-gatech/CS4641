My office took the Neal family from Fargo to the top of the Capitol Dome this week. 

Quite the view, and quite the walk down. https://t.co/wY7ae7yCFi I wore this button to honor National Tribal Colleges Week as I presided over the Senate. 

These colleges offer students an atmosphere where they can increase their knowledge and skillsets grounded in cultural traditions. https://t.co/5xx1eq5XhZ This month, we get to celebrate our diversity and the generations of African Americans who have contributed greatly to our nation’s story. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/ccCvzgxIbu Ken &amp; Cara Hall were 2 of the North Dakotans attending the 2019 National Prayer Breakfast. #GodisGood. https://t.co/4tkpCu4u7d All these meetings give me a chance to advance a pro-North Dakota agenda and to influence policies as they are being made. 

I look forward to continuing to meet with important leaders, like @DOIDepSec. https://t.co/HObcc4zZKe Nicole Nason’s nomination to run @USDOTFHWA is now before the @EPWGOP. 

I met with her to discuss the importance to North Dakota of reauthorizing the highway bill and repairing our crumbling infrastructure. https://t.co/kG5YRJglSt This afternoon I met with a familiar face, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney. 

With the entire Fargo-Moorhead Flood Diversion Authority in town, I was able to hear their update on the latest local projects. https://t.co/E8n2sp0w2P I also spoke with @SecAFOfficial about the importance of the nuclear triad in North Dakota and about their budget. 

Sitting on both @BudgetGOP and @SASCmajority allow me to help craft a @usairforce budget that reflects their mission and the right priorities. https://t.co/aHMu7I2yUy This morning I spoke with @SecWilkie about rural health care, strengthening the relationship between @DeptVetAffairs and Native American veterans, and giving them health care control. 

As a member of @VAChair, I plan to bring him to our state to meet North Dakota veterans. https://t.co/JwadcVdH6c Yesterday I met with @TheJusticeDept nominee William Barr. 

We discussed states’ rights and my concern about the consolidation of litigation authority that's empowered bureaucrats to fight against @POTUS. 

He's a qualified nominee and I look forward to supporting him. https://t.co/4ummbIflY7 As the agenda for the #116thCongress is being set, I’ve held several meetings with top administration officials and North Dakota leaders this week to discuss shared priorities. Now is the time to reject over-the-top political partisanship and rhetoric and to deliver results for the American people. 

That’s what I’m committed to doing. #SOTU Some will immediately denounce this agenda; sadly, some already did even before @POTUS gave his speech. 

That is wrong. #SOTU On the heels of a rocket-ship economy, @POTUS offers a plan to revitalize our crumbling infrastructure, negotiate better trade deals, protect national security, and fix our broken immigration system. Divided government is the right time to enact these bipartisan solutions. #SOTU Tonight @POTUS delivered an uplifting message that this entire country— and this entire Congress— can rally behind. #SOTU https://t.co/bA29YpgAxV RT @SenateGOP: TUNE IN: @POTUS @realdonaldtrump delivers the #SOTU address https://t.co/zSFPTnUvhi He’s arrived! Still so thankful to be joined by @debjyotidwivedy. #SOTU https://t.co/Vp6KFH181y Added a very special #SOTU guest, @realMikeLindell. He’s a good friend and an even better man of God.

He also makes one great pillow. https://t.co/kTlX8PXU1t I hope to hear @POTUS strike a serious yet aspiring tone in his #SOTU tonight. 

He has a positive agenda that both sides could support, if they’re willing to do so. https://t.co/1wUty6sl6l Finally. https://t.co/TFvE8mZOa7 .@POTUS is committed to ensuring strong political support for the Kurds in Syria. 

While he’s calling for an orderly withdrawal of ground troops, he’s not going to abandon the Kurdish people. https://t.co/9wOfD3jMAS @BloombergTV @cj_wentz @kevcirilli Told him he’d fit right in wearing his Eagles jersey if he ever visits North Dakota. https://t.co/udhizXU4I9 Enjoyed my interview with @BloombergTV Chief Washington Correspondent and fellow @cj_wentz fan @kevcirilli yesterday. https://t.co/gSx2NHRrnL During his confirmation hearing, I questioned Mr. Wheeler on year-round E15 and RFS before inviting him to visit North Dakota. https://t.co/DT4GrwqOV2 The arguments against Mr. Wheeler do not hold up; his energy, environment, and EPA experiences are an asset, not a liability. 

I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Wheeler and to vote on his confirmation as quickly as possible. The policies pursued by @POTUS and implemented by @EPAAWheeler have had a positive impact on North Dakota and the country. 

Mr. Wheeler’s excellent work on RFS, WOTUS, the Clean Power Plan, and year-round E15 show he is ready to take on this position in a permanent capacity. https://t.co/dteoF5nqgM It is my hope we can finally pass a version of the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Workers Act this Congress. #SOTU ND is blessed to be home to many immigrant software developers, physicians, surgeons, engineers and other professionals. The long wait for these valued neighbors and servants to get green cards is a disservice to them, their families, and the potential of the American economy. As Congress debates the many aspects of our broken immigration system, Debjyoti offers expertise and experiences that reflect North Dakota priorities and values. 

@immivoice has been a steady support in my effort to lift the arbitrary per-country caps on high-skilled immigrants. My #SOTU guest is @debjyotidwivedy. He’s a an Enterprise Cloud Manager, @NDSU Master’s degree recipient, and Senior Vice President of @immivoice. https://t.co/ofjbeiYimx We need an all-the-above strategy to fix the crisis at the border, including physical barriers. 

That’s what @POTUS is committed to, and Democrats should join him. #SOTU https://t.co/0D3RNXzy7C Walking to work always inspires. This #SOTU morning especially. #GodisGood. https://t.co/cIQHftwhUG .@POTUS is ready to address the crisis at the southern border. 

It’s on Congress to decide whether to continue obstructing his efforts or to be part of the solution. #SOTU https://t.co/8kmDGo8kLN I joined @SenJoniErnst in re-introducing Sarah’s Law. 

No one should walk free after taking someone’s life. We have to work to protect our citizens. https://t.co/v1nfkfrXU5 @NCC worship was incredible today at Barracks Row. Message by @joelschmidgall &amp; @ninaschmidgall touched Kris and me. I can’t wait to read their new book. #prayingcirclesaroundyourmarriage #GodisGood. Abel was not impressed with this DC snowman. https://t.co/u91kcbje3t From day one, @POTUS has made it clear he will not allow the U.S. to be the victim of foreign nations acting in bad faith. 

I support this administration and our NATO allies as they engage in effective arms control negotiations that will hold all parties accountable. Let’s be clear: Russia has been violating this treaty for years.

Their covert attempts to continue developing a missile system the INF explicitly prohibited is unacceptable. https://t.co/g4V4sm8TqF A smart step by @SecretarySonny that will help diversify our agricultural exports. 

This administration is doing an excellent job finding innovative ways to expand our markets, even in the face of trade disputes. https://t.co/k9GGEdMQBg Great to see Bruce Gjovig in D.C. 

We spoke about the Cavalier Air Force Station, the growth of Grand Sky in Grand Forks, and my work on @SASCMajority this Congress. https://t.co/ytQSQpqSYM Through this Conference Committee, @POTUS has given Democrats a chance to live up to their rhetoric: that they would negotiate a deal while the government’s re-opened. 

Let’s get this done. https://t.co/r4ZGSSc4Vt Met with students from Minnewaukan High School in my office yesterday. 

These students had great questions about the legislative process and immigration reform. https://t.co/07FOYmFbE8 A divided Congress presents an opportunity to strike a deal on an infrastructure package. 

With the highway bill expiring soon, now is the time to act. https://t.co/15feFm8X75 .@usdafsa changed the dates for deadlines that were impacted by the shutdown. 

Get the facts here⬇️ https://t.co/c3hJJZ16u1 Good for @SecretarySonny. 

The way the Senate’s handled nominations doesn’t work, and it’s time we consider serious changes to the nominations process. https://t.co/Pqa08SqnaM Great news: Grand Forks is ranked one of the best cities for veterans to live. 

As a new member of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee, I’ll work to give these veterans a voice on issues that matter most to them. https://t.co/ujhuOFqwQ4 North Dakota farmers and families should not have to posthumously pay for being successful. 

The tax cuts were a good first step toward ending this unfair taxation, and I hope we finally abolish it. https://t.co/DoEcyWvUCt The tax cuts are working in North Dakota. 

Since they were passed, we’ve added over 9,000 jobs. https://t.co/Uokp6eZNgw I’m joining @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenatorEnzi, and @SenJohnHoeven to co-sponsor the ONSHORE Act. 

As a former energy and environmental state regulator, I’ve always opposed the federal government imposing its mediocrity on North Dakota. https://t.co/jzmR3VJt93 Looking forward to chairing this @EPWGOP subcommittee. 

It gives North Dakota an outsized voice on issues like WOTUS, the Clean Water Act, and countless others. https://t.co/YHguUOghYn Extreme weather conditions in North Dakota that only get worse as the week goes on. 

Stay safe! https://t.co/5NCUWq44Lx I’m co-sponsoring the End Government Shutdowns Act. It enhances predictability, reduces pressure for imperfect, last-minute deals, saves taxpayer dollars, and helps economic growth. 

As a member of @BudgetGOP, it’s time we make real changes to this process. https://t.co/PKNd58cgvR Last night the Senate sent a positive message to our allies in the Middle East, but the work isn’t done. 

Let’s get this bill passed. https://t.co/GkNBFtwxgi Another step in the right direction for our soybean producers thanks to @POTUS. 

I’ll continue to work with the administration to see more markets opened and more export growth. https://t.co/3NSX8fsihh Deeply disturbing. 

As I’ve said from day one, the rising tide of anti-Semitism among House Democrats shouldn’t be ignored or tolerated. https://t.co/O5BcoqSnPL More than 4 in 5 American Indian women- and Alaska Native women- have experienced violence in their life. 

That’s unacceptable. 

I’m co-sponsoring #SavannasAct with @lisamurkowski because something must be done. https://t.co/DmDNjNsCfx Our budget system needs reform. I’m co-sponsoring legislation with @senrobportman to prevent government shutdowns from creating chaos for the people who rely on federal services. 

We have to end the weaponization of this process. https://t.co/HtREPzM0nv With the government re-opened, we’re again voting on a bill to support Israel and Jordan while sanctioning Assad. 

Democrats first opposed it because of politics, but now is their chance to stand with our allies in the region. https://t.co/eIixlG7aMI We have 18 days to prevent another shutdown and fund border security. 

I’m confident @SenJohnHoeven and our colleagues on the conference committee can find a long-term solution that satisfies both sides. https://t.co/FbtumjozCQ We’ve reintroduced #SavannasAct, important legislation to help combat crimes on tribal lands. 

Let’s work together to make sure the #116thCongress gets this done. https://t.co/4ekPKwxb2S May we never forget the countless, innocent lives lost, and may we always honor their memory. #WeRemember https://t.co/7tSodkInfu With the government re-opened, @SpeakerPelosi and Senate Democrats must come to the table so we can find a long-term solution. Now is the time to act. https://t.co/zRA0DPswk7 .@POTUS is right: Congress needs to step up and tackle immigration reform, but this shutdown has demonstrated larger problems in the way our government is run. 

Congress should consider including broad budgetary and personnel reforms in any future deals. https://t.co/EepORsuxBS I supported today’s deal. 

While @SpeakerPelosi refused to even come to the table, @POTUS was the adult in the room who ended this impasse. It’s a tragedy that what used to be the mainstream media rushes to judgement because they want to believe a story. 

These students did nothing wrong. 

They were not the guilty party. https://t.co/cM5SyYvVxs Right now, we’re voting on the one bill that actually ends this shutdown. 

It secures the border, re-opens the government, gets federal workers paid and back to work, and includes reforms Democrats have wanted for years. 

Now is the time to get this done. https://t.co/rjL6jNAt9Z Now is the time to get something done. 

@SpeakerPelosi- and the Senate Democrats protecting her- are the reason the government is still shutdown, but she is running out of time and her caucus is running out of patience. https://t.co/DPSsmeOPUZ Spoke with @SandraSmithFox and @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom about re-opening the government. 

Only one of today's bills could become law and end the shutdown, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. https://t.co/1giJToxVqa North Dakota is always happy to host you, Mr. President! https://t.co/Y7FeRZfCGD This has got to be one of the most important days of the year. 

I’d never pass up an opportunity for a slice. #NationalPieDay https://t.co/Ze3zPP3h0I If @SpeakerPelosi had spent as much time negotiating as she did being petty about the State of the Union, the shutdown would be over by now. https://t.co/Kk2V7YQkdn While @POTUS offers a plan to re-open the government and secure our borders, Democrats only offer obstruction. 

It’s now clear their only goal is to oppose this President. https://t.co/Tg5zq0LVbO Once again, @SecretarySonny is finding ways to provide relief to our farmers. 

I commend the administration for making them a priority. https://t.co/wPJaTKZPSx .@AmericaNewsroom with @BillHemmer &amp; @SandraSmithFox is revealing how sick the left is. 

@washingtonpost reporter &amp; a leftist are incapable of blaming haters for Covington incident. Every decent statement goes to a “but” or “however” followed by rationalization. Sick. I introduced a resolution with @SenatorTimScott and @SenFeinstein declaring this week as National #SchoolChoiceWeek.

We should foster an environment that encourages students to enjoy learning and gives them the freedom to choose their own educational path. https://t.co/YO7XwnWkmL As @senatemajldr said, “Everyone has made their point, now it’s time to make a law.” 

Even the Washington Post knows the Democrats need to stop yelling no and start working to end this shutdown. https://t.co/FCNob8wxpk .@SpeakerPelosi and @POTUS have to come to some resolution. 

While the President offers solutions, the Speaker has offered nothing. It’s time for Democrats to get serious about ending the shutdown. https://t.co/Cgrg8N9TXn .@SpeakerPelosi is acting like an incompetent negotiator. 

Her colleagues support border security and support ending the shutdown. It’s time she do the same. https://t.co/jkZrTDg7Hc Told @chrisbergPOVNOW an alien invasion is coming. It’s not, but I bet BuzzFeed will run with it anyway. 

The recent amount of inaccurate reporting is concerning, and it’s time for the media to take a long look in the mirror. https://t.co/xsJHXFBWYt Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s legacy continues to inspire change throughout the world. Today we remember his life and the lessons he taught. https://t.co/eiP6jwdnmA Last week, I invited EPA Administrator nominee Andrew Wheeler to North Dakota to visit the Energy and Environment Research Center at the @UofNorthDakota. 

Mr. Wheeler’s work on issues like #E15, RFS, and WOTUS has made a positive impact on our state. https://t.co/DT4GrwqOV2 .@POTUS has captured moral high ground, and @SpeakerPelosi is an incompetent liberal if she doesn’t join him. #EndTheShutdown #BuildTheWall https://t.co/9qjOmdqusc Many didn't notice, but earlier this week, I presided over a Senate motion that reaffirmed our right to religious liberty. 

It passed unanimously. https://t.co/sXA5NV6LtJ Last night a bill to protect the taxpayer from funding the abortion industry failed on the Senate floor. 

Bills like this are #whywemarch, and I will continue the fight for the rights of the unborn. #MarchForLife https://t.co/O82jxb9UX2 I’m co-sponsoring several bills to protect the rights of the unborn. 

I was sent to Washington to advocate for bills like these, and I will always fight in the Senate to protect life. #MarchForLife https://t.co/z5eOcMpr2Q Welcome to all the North Dakotans who are in D.C. for today's #MarchForLife. 

The right to life is a critical issue facing our nation, and both sides need to get serious about addressing it. https://t.co/giVXBAKTk7 Be careful Roscoe. You are in the very deep end without a life jacket. https://t.co/gQGlgWa2iE I co-sponsored this bill to protect the taxpayer from funding the abortion industry.

Full statement—&gt; https://t.co/HyceA4ey7U It’s disappointing the Senate did not vote to advance this piece of legislation.

The right to life is a critical issue facing our nation, and we have to learn to prioritize it. https://t.co/F4xIWbP9KD On Syria, I'd like a slow withdrawal, but I'd like to know with some great certainty that we are there, not only that we aren't abandoning our friends, but also that we aren't abandoning our influence in the region. https://t.co/vr0wL2hIKc Apprenticeship programs are critical in North Dakota for bridging the divide between workforce demand and workforce supply. 

I met with @SecretaryAcosta to discuss these and other administration priorities, and formally invited him to North Dakota. https://t.co/kfSx8Jsrsr I’ve been a longtime advocate for year-round #E15. Not just as advocates of ethanol, but as conservatives, we should seek to eliminate barriers to markets. https://t.co/UJmC3W3voE Should we bar farmers from running USDA? 
Doctors from running HHS? 
Attorneys from being Attorney General? 
Democrats are taking these @POTUS nominees in the wrong direction. https://t.co/88Xb6cT2fy Nearly everybody who talks to me from North Dakota wants a secure border. 

This shutdown comes down to @POTUS and @SpeakerPelosi. If she's not willing to offer more than a dollar, then there's not very much to talk about. https://t.co/Eu4Z1FGTju Peter Welte is an excellent choice by @POTUS. As a farmer, a graduate of both @UofNorthDakota and @NDSU, and an accomplished lawyer, Peter is the right person to effectively serve North Dakotans. https://t.co/K3yIdBirPz .@POTUS once told a crowd they would get tired of winning, and @NDSUfootball apparently took that as a challenge. 

But don’t worry: we’re not tired of winning yet! https://t.co/faCkvXyBag Great news that North Dakota’s farmers and ranchers will have the opportunity to receive assistance with time-sensitive matters. 

Secretary Perdue has done an excellent job ensuring the shutdown’s impact on our agricultural community is as minimal as possible. https://t.co/n4xAIwZNW0 This fight is not a political fight, but a fight for humanity itself. It is a war against all of us and against all of our children, no matter our ideologies. 

We have to learn to prioritize this issue in our own parties and work across the aisle. https://t.co/L83HzZJCsI A border crisis, government shutdown, and Democrats who won’t come to the table, yet the @washingtonpost is focused on calorie counting the food @POTUS bought Clemson. 

Democrats needs to get serious about the issues facing our nation, and apparently so does the media. https://t.co/2jrZRXwX47 Wonderful news. Congratulations to those serving on the USS North Dakota! They’ve taken the name of our state all across the world. https://t.co/XQknTNJrfm I promised the people of North Dakota that I would fight for life at all stages. 

Now, I unite with those who will march this Friday, who will walk with heavy and hopeful hearts, and who pray for the 60 million discarded children who have been denied their first breath.” https://t.co/X57pSyfNIe I’m co-sponsoring legislation to pay essential workers. 

When I flew from Bismarck to Washington, the sentiment was clear: TSA agents want paychecks and passengers want border security. No reason we can’t make both a reality. https://t.co/3YNIQKkuLW Great moment for North Dakota yesterday as @POTUS gave a shout out to Monango farmer Val Wagner, who expressed her concern about over-regulation. 

Yet again, this is a President who hears the concerns of our agricultural community. https://t.co/fAdZSH9iRB About to do my first radio town hall with Jay Thomas since being sworn in. Tune in! https://t.co/JUt0oQFtHe https://t.co/HfkVDR2htv This is childish. 

@POTUS has repeatedly made clear he is ready to negotiate to reopen the government. It’s disappointing House Democrats won’t do the same. https://t.co/jIqYZOJaqn This afternoon I’m delivering my first speech on the Senate floor about the most important issue of our time: defending the life of the unborn. 

Watch here: https://t.co/TQ6Ntm2Yyj https://t.co/qaCoYDFhb5 The rising anti-Israel sentiment among the Democrats is unsettling, and needs to be addressed. 

This is not something Democrat leadership should tolerate. https://t.co/CBoJdhO2ct This is very encouraging news. As a new member of the Senate VA Committee, I plan to continue reforms that will make it easier for veterans to find gainful employment. https://t.co/N504WowtRa A vast majority of North Dakotans want the wall. 

It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to quit opposing border security and to work with @POTUS on reopening the government. https://t.co/HHc5wFiX93 Divided government presents the perfect opportunity for Congress to address the energy issues facing our country. Now is the time to act. https://t.co/Ujcg4h1JUS Reminder: @SecretarySonny extended the deadline for ag producers to apply for payments under MFP during the shutdown. 

The administration won’t allow House Democrats to make our farmers collateral in the border security debate. More info--&gt;  https://t.co/kjai7ABLi5 https://t.co/mgP7A4Y4cc After I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, I was so thankful to be joined by wife Kris, my family, my friends, and everyone who made this moment possible.

It’s an honor to serve North Dakota in the Senate. https://t.co/k8uTcUrNLi https://t.co/V31yvifgxu House Democrats may not like them, but facts are facts. It’s time to build the wall. https://t.co/Ns7NXbQjgw RT @WhiteHouse: Congress needs to give our Border Patrol agents the laws, equipment, and barrier they need to fully secure our border. #Sec… .@SpeakerPelosi should listen to what former President Obama’s Border Patrol chief has to say about building the wall.  https://t.co/vdLbAemL2W Great to see @POTUS will once again address the annual @FarmBureau convention. This is a President who truly listens to farmers and ranchers. https://t.co/Tb3NTzRoI5 Looks like CNN just learned why we need to build the wall. https://t.co/X0INY6oLlX This week Senate Dems voted against supporting Israel and sanctioning Syria because of the unrelated shutdown and their own party's rising anti-Semitism. Neither reason is acceptable. 

The bill is back on the floor, and I urge my colleagues to support it. https://t.co/IX47VpZfCA It couldn’t be more clear: the people of North Dakota want us to build the wall, and I’m going to keep fighting for them. https://t.co/5LEeu0SIjx Serving on this Committee is an honor. It allows me to be a voice for our veterans in North Dakota, and I’m ready to get to work for them. https://t.co/RHjgJwuQi0 I’m so thankful for our fine men and women who serve in North Dakota’s law enforcement. They wake up every day willing to risk their lives to provide the safety and security we so easily take for granted. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/tRAMcf48Zl .@POTUS won because POTUS is right. Democrats must stop politicizing human tragedy and start supporting increased border security, including the wall. https://t.co/FoqFaBNzfJ @POTUS made a clear &amp; compelling case for border security including a barrier. Democrats must stop politicizing human tragedy and fund a wall &amp; vote to reopen the rest of the government. Tomorrow is not too soon. https://t.co/q55g7nHvTH Disappointing, but sadly unsurprising. Israel used to have support from both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/pqDraONja0 China accepting these imports is a positive development for our agricultural community, especially North Dakota, where all crops affected by this decision are grown.

I’m encouraged by the progress being made in Beijing, and I hope it continues. https://t.co/d1oM9nMHfz .@SecretarySonny announced important news today that @usdafsa will extend the deadline for farmers to apply for trade-relief payments. 

This Administration always has their back, even as other important issues are being debated. https://t.co/QHIDTmft2w This bill reaffirms this simple truth: our Middle East allies are our friends, and their enemies are our enemies. I urge my fellow senators to join us in standing with them by passing the SASME Act. As my colleague Senator Rubio has noted, the SASME Act’s growing opposition from Senate Democrats may be nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to hide the rising anti-Semitism in their own party. 

Not only is that unacceptable, but it’s also not working. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues seem to be using the unrelated partial shutdown as an excuse to oppose the SASME Act, but their rationale does not add up. 

If we truly are the world’s greatest deliberative body, we should be able to deliberate multiple issues at once. In addition to my colleagues who introduced the bill— @marcorubio, @SenatorRisch, @SenCoryGardner and @senatemajldr— the SASME Act is backed by prominent pro-Israel groups who understand the importance of this legislation. I am signing on as a co-sponsor to S.1, the SASME Act. This bolsters security cooperation with Israel and Jordan, authorizes sanctions against the Syrian dictatorship, and allows our state and local governments to properly counter anti-Israel movements.

My statement—&gt; https://t.co/XmKDxMAnMO Looking forward to @POTUS's address tonight. We need to secure our borders and finally address our broken illegal immigration system, and I believe divided government is the right time to do that. https://t.co/vF4oXjYRak Encouraging news from the EU today. I am optimistic this administration will continue to work with our trading partners to open up markets and deliver better deals for North Dakota’s agricultural community. https://t.co/gLUbm1q5nh This is unacceptable. The United States should stand with Israel, no matter what other issues we are debating. 

I will be voting for the “Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019,” and I urge my colleagues to do the same. https://t.co/3qUgovGAar Congratulations Governor Noem. Kris and I love you and are proud of you! https://t.co/AZHx9gEyPk I chose "Desk IV" as my Senate Chamber desk, the same desk previously occupied by ND Senators William (“Wild Bill”) Langer and Quentin N.

I intend to work with my colleagues about hearing and passing it in the remaining hours of the 115th Congress.  We are rapidly running out of time to approve a bill the Senate took over one year to pass and the House received on December 10. 1 of 2
I appreciate the passion of many constituents on this important issue.  Today, I talked with Acting US Attorney General Matt Whitaker &amp; contacted @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy about #SavannasAct and the hurdles the House must overcome to pass the bill. Judge’s decision to declare #Obamacare unconstitutional presents an opportunity for our divided government to pass #healthcare reform to protect people with #PreExistingConditions &amp; lower health care costs.

It was a great evening of fellowship with new &amp; old friends! https://t.co/XUJ1C5sn2C Like frankincense, myrrh was a resin extracted from a host of small thorny trees in the Middle East.... https://t.co/xTyCdDY3jI Another @NCAA_FCS appearance in @CityOfFriscoTx as @NDSUfootball beat @GoJacksFB in @fdome on @espn #FCSPlayoffs #GoBison @ https://t.co/7EieXhvthZ The integrity of the supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (#SNAP) is significantly strengthened with 30 improvements in the new #FARMBILL.  It increases training opportunities for recipients and helps move them toward self-sufficiency. https://t.co/i6tE4J5Hay We’ve worked long and hard for this big win for ND.  New #FARMBILL removes industrial #hemp from regulation as a controlled substance &amp; legalizes it as an agricultural commodity. It makes it eligible for crop insurance and mandates a streamlined process for developing policies. https://t.co/cVdSyXV0Zs A priority for North Dakota #sugarbeet producers is the new #FARMBILL maintain the no-cost sugar program. I’m pleased this had wide support in Congress.  Another win directs the FDA to not require added sugars declarations for single ingredient foods like sugar and honey. https://t.co/Jdqtwp7UPc The new #FARMBILL increases limits on loan guarantees, and farm ownership and operating loan programs. These new limits better represent the true cost of contemporary agriculture and will help producers buy, build and maintain new or existing farms and ranches. https://t.co/Pxm20OY5dO The new #FARMBILL establishes a common-sense vegetation management pilot program I introduced as a stand-alone bill for federal forest land. This lets utilities do their job to secure the right of way for major transmission lines and helps prevent fires. https://t.co/NyfztyfYFD I heard from many ND producers on including language in the new #FARMBILL to prevent and respond to emerging animal diseases. It reauthorizes the National Animal Health Laboratory Network for rapid disease diagnosis &amp; establishes a U.S.-only vaccine bank to respond to threats. https://t.co/4jun1cPLpz #FARMBILL fixes Agriculture Risk Coverage payment rates requested by Logan and LaMoure county corn growers and is based on my stand-alone bill. Mandates using actual yields &amp; making payments to producers based on the rate in the county with the most farm acres. https://t.co/CagbFSnJjR Joined my fellow conferees this morning to sign the #FarmBill Conference Report.  I hope the #House and #Senate will quickly pass the bill and give our #farmers, #ranchers, and Rural Americans the certainty and stability they deserve. #ndpol https://t.co/SCypF1gx3M It was a great honor to join  North Dakota’s student leaders before heading to DC. You all inspire me! https://t.co/k0WTfpOHWc It’s always good to speak to the ND Association of Telecommunications Cooperatives. We covered the House Rural Broadband Caucus urging the @FCC to increase high-speed connectivity in rural America and the new #FarmBill including language from my Rural Broadband Act. https://t.co/pShxjFH91e RT @MikePenceVP: I'm thankful for every day Hillary Clinton is not President!

Grateful for care providers at EMS, critical access hospitals, &amp; rural health clinics to serve these areas. #PowerofRural Alzheimer’s is a public health crisis in ND. That’s why I support the #BOLDAlzheimersAct, which will address the Alzheimer’s crisis through the @CDCgov and make a difference in the lives of all those affected. #ENDALZ On this #VeteransDay and the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI, we reflect on the freedoms won and express our gratitude for service of all veterans &amp; the North Dakotans who served, fought, and those who died in WWI. https://t.co/MhDV9ojENA Great visiting with the many North Dakotans who attended @ndfb’s annual meeting. https://t.co/TWLql1KxHl 129 years ago, #NorthDakota became the 39th state admitted to the Union. Happy Birthday ND.
