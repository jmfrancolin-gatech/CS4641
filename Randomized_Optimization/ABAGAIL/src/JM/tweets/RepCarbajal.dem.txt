Being a parent should never keep a veteran from accessing the care they need and deserve. As a veteran and a parent myself, I'm glad to see the Veterans Access to Childcare Act pass today. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/WPhoCbMhxG Yesterday marked my first hearing serving as Vice Chair of @TransportDems!

From our roads to our waterways, Americans rely on infrastructure every single day. We can't afford to keep ignoring the trillion-dollar backlog of maintenance &amp; repair needs. https://t.co/ROGZDzFaJr For 6 million veteran parents, obtaining medical treatment can be extremely difficult if they can't access childcare. Vets deserve unobstructed access to the care &amp; treatment they deserve, which is why I voted today to pass the Veteran‚Äôs Access to Childcare Act. #ChildCare4Vets Yesterday, Congress held a long overdue hearing on reforming our campaign finance system &amp; how the #ForThePeople Act helps tilt the balance of power away from special interests &amp; back to the American people.

Read how I'm working to shine a light on dark money in our elections: This week, for the first time in 8 years, we held hearings on some of the biggest issues facing Americans today:

‚úÖ Climate Change
‚úÖ Gun Violence
‚úÖ¬†Campaign Finance Reform

@HouseDemocrats aren't here to waste time. Excited to solve these issues &amp; more in the 116th Congress. Secondary cockpit barriers are a simple &amp; cost-effective solution to prevent hijackings. I support @WeAreALPA's call to protect the safety of our airline pilots &amp; passengers by implementing the 2018 FAA Reauthorization's cockpit barrier standards across all commercial aircraft. https://t.co/UuCiUe5Hu2 17 of the hottest years on record occurred in the past 18 years. House GOP leadership refused to hold hearings on climate change, but we can‚Äôt ignore our üåé any longer. Today @NRDems held their first hearing on climate change. It‚Äôs time to #ActOnClimate in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/KxouYpXOo8 Sporting our avocado apparel today for our meeting with the California Avocado Commission! Had a wonderful discussion about the issues affecting Central Coast avocado growers and our local agricultural industry. https://t.co/LeW3l94Rzm Not one mention of climate change tonight from @POTUS. We cannot afford to ignore increasing threats from wildfires, drought, &amp; hurricanes any longer. People‚Äôs lives depend on our action. #SOTU2019 Far too many lives have been taken at the hands of gun violence. It‚Äôs time to honor the victims with action and pursue common-sense, bipartisan legislation that prevents gun violence and saves lives.#SOTU2EndGunViolence I was heartbroken and sickened by the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. It was a senseless hate crime. Anti-semitism and bigotry have no place in our society. Ensuring women are afforded economic opportunities also means ensuring they have the right to make their own decisions about their own bodies. #SOTU2019 The Administration‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the INF treaty threatens our national security and brings us closer to a nuclear arms race. #SOTU2019 It does not serve our national security interests to ban transgender soldiers from being able to serve the country they have stepped up to protect. #SOTU2019 #ProtectTransTroops. Our nation is strengthened by our relationships with our allies. We should be working with them, not against them. #SOTU2019 One thing @POTUS got right in his #SOTU tonight: more women are serving in Congress than ever before. So honored to be serving alongside them. I stand ready to work with the Administration as the Vice Chair of @TransportDems to secure strategic investment in modern, renewable, &amp; resilient infrastructure projects. #SOTU2019 Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on US agriculture and fruit hit close to home on the #CentralCoast. At a time when CA ranchers and farmers are facing a labor shortage &amp; historic drought, @POTUS used American growers as pawns in a trade war.  https://t.co/NxbGvDMSVI .@POTUS expressed a desire tonight to break through partisan gridlock that all Americans share. Unfortunately, in the same speech, he continued to divide us further. His actions after this TV appearance will speak louder than his words. #SOTU2019 The Central Coast's thriving agricultural industry relies on a steady, legal immigrant workforce. Many local farmers and growers have told me that one of their top concerns is the costly ongoing labor shortage, which is exacerbated by the President‚Äôs immigration policies. #SOTU Fact check: the only crisis at the border is the one @POTUS manufactured himself with his extreme immigration policies. In fact, apprehensions at the US-Mexico border are at a 45 year low. 

#SOTU2019 I met with @CPB agents in Alamogordo, NM two months ago to hear directly about what they need to carry out their duties more effectively. They mentioned advanced tech, including sensors, more personnel &amp; improved infrastructure at ports of entry. 

Not one mentioned a wall. #SOTU We cannot govern under continuous threat of a government shutdown. Instead of using fear-mongering &amp; falsehoods to achieve his political goals, I encourage @POTUS to work with @HouseDemocrats toward smart, bipartisan solutions that meet our border security needs. #SOTU2019 The President should not be attempting to undermine the Special Counsel's investigation during the #SOTU. Mueller's investigation must be allowed to continue without obstruction. When he talks about rolling back ‚Äúburdensome‚Äù regulations, @POTUS is really talking about undermining the environmental protections that ensure we have clean air to breath and clean water to drink. #SOTU2019 The Trump Administration has undermined Americans‚Äô access to affordable health care at every turn. 

Instead of defending the Affordable Care Act, he‚Äôs urging federal courts to strike down it‚Äôs protections for people with pre-existing conditions as unconstitutional. #SOTU2019 .@POTUS tells us "we have launched an unprecedented economic boom"

Meanwhile, he ignores the fact that he shut down the government over a senseless campaign promise. That temper tantrum cost our economy $3 billion in permanent losses. #SOTU2019 .@POTUS took credit for declining unemployment rates, but what he failed to address was the fact that more and more Americans are taking two or three jobs to pay the bills. 

It‚Äôs time we focus on policies that help the middle class, not tax benefits for the wealthiest 1%. #SOTU To really help America's workers @POTUS can

‚úîÔ∏è Support the Raise the Wage Act so every American has a living wage.
‚úîÔ∏è Reform our tax code to benefit the middle-class, not the wealthiest 1%.
‚úîÔ∏è Not hold federal employees‚Äô paychecks hostage to secure a campaign promise.

#SOTU2019 Working families across America are working full time jobs and still struggling to make ends meet. I‚Äôm proud to be a cosponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2024. #SOTU2019 RT @SpecNews1SoCal: .@RepCarbajal hopes Pres. Trump abandons divisive rhetoric &amp; focuses on issues like immigration, healthcare &amp; climate c‚Ä¶ Grateful to have Erik Talkin, the CEO of @FoodBankSBC join me at #SOTU2019 tonight. Erik &amp; the Foodbank worked hard to help federal workers put food on the table during the government shutdown. https://t.co/2uC8NH4vYD Happy Lunar New Year to everyone celebrating on the Central Coast! Wishing you all good fortune and joy in the #YearOfThePig. Tomorrow, @POTUS will address the nation at the #SOTU2019. Over the last two years, the President's actions have spoken far louder than his words, but I'm hoping he will go beyond fear-mongering and offer bipartisanship and compromise.

Here's what I'm watching for tomorrow: https://t.co/Zt6QNSRbt4 Erik &amp; @FoodbankSBC have a long history of working to combat food insecurity in our community. They recently helped feed families of 458 federal workers who had nowhere else to turn during the 35-day shutdown. Grateful he will join me at #SOTU tomorrow. 
https://t.co/23aQETDQXs I recently voted for $1.6 billion in strategic border security measures and as negotiations continue, I will support expanding this funding for smart and effective solutions that do not rely on a costly and ineffective wall. When I visited a @CBP facility in New Mexico earlier this month, I spoke with agents about the need for better technology, more personnel, &amp; improved infrastructure at our ports of entry. They never mentioned a wall, which is a antiquated solution to a modern problem. https://t.co/wohyX4sFXL Erik and the Santa Barbara County Foodbank have a long history of working to combat food insecurity in our community, and they recently stepped up to help feed the families of 458 federal workers who had nowhere else to turn during the 35 day government shutdown.

Today, I gladly joined my colleagues in voting to recognize their dedication &amp; specialized skill set by lifting the federal worker pay freeze to give our federal workforce a long-overdue raise.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm re-introducing the California Clean Coast Act, which prohibits future oil drilling off the coast of California. https://t.co/kbP3nlMsUz 50 years ago today, the Santa Barbara oil spill devastated our coastline‚Äôs vibrant ecosystem and handicapped our local economy for several months. Our coastal community, and communities across California, cannot afford another disastrous oil spill. RT @NRDems: The blatant, corrupt favoritism shown towards oil &amp; gas companies during the #TrumpShutdown makes it clear: the president and h‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad @realDonaldTrump finally agreed to reopen the government until mid-February. It looks just like the deal we passed weeks ago to keep government open through mid-February. 

This was a completely unnecessary shutdown that hurt millions of Americans. This shutdown is an unconscionable threat to our national security. @POTUS and @senatemajldr need to reopen the government and stop negotiating on the backs of those who work every day to keep us safe. This shutdown has left @uscoastguard members w/o paychecks, food allowances, or housing allowances. Last week, I met with Coast Guard servicemembers stationed in Morro Bay to hear their stories firsthand and discuss the resources available to them. https://t.co/v5XsFfu6bk We can no longer afford to ignore our failing infrastructure, which Americans rely on each day. I'm ready to hit the ground running as Vice Chair with @RepPeterDeFazio &amp; @TransportDems to help put Americans back to work by securing robust investments in our infrastructure. I had to reschedule my town hall on the Central Coast this week to stay in Washington DC and keep working to end the senseless #TrumpShutdown. But I still want to hear from you!

Today, and every day, we honor Martin Luther King Jr‚Äôs legacy by standing united against injustice. #MLKDay https://t.co/WGcg6ZF9m4 46 years ago today, #RoevWade made abortion legal in the US and solidified a woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her own body &amp; future on her own terms. 
 
Since then, this right has come under attack, but I promise to keep fighting for reproductive freedom for all. https://t.co/wbvdLf96Ld I urge the President to reopen the government immediately so we can continue negotiating border security funding, without denying hard-working federal employees their paychecks. The latest proposal includes changes to the legal asylum system that would only exacerbate the chaos at the border, keeps his senseless demand for a $5.7 billion border wall &amp; provides only temporary protection for only a fraction of our nation‚Äôs #Dreamers. .@POTUS has talked a big game about ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù negotiations, but his latest proposal is far from a compromise ‚Äì it's a sham. 

You don't have to take it from me üëáhttps://t.co/MX55Nbg2Cd My town hall on the Central Coast was rescheduled this week so I could remain in D.C. &amp; keep working to end the government shutdown, but I still want to hear directly from you. Join me for a Facebook Live Town Hall TOMORROW at 4pm.

The true disgrace is that @POTUS refuses to accept this reality.

In this new Congress, I will continue to work to protect our air and water from attacks under this Administration, as well as promote strategic investments to address the worsening effects of climate change on the Central Coast. The new Democratic House majority stands ready to work. As we begin the 116th Congress, we will vote immediately to end Trump‚Äôs government shutdown which has suspended pay for thousands of hardworking Americans and limited federal services. I‚Äôd like to wish everyone on the Central Coast a wonderful New Year, full of joy and hope for the future.
 
This past year was difficult for many Americans as our country seemed to grow even more divided, but as we look forward to the new year there is so much to be hopeful for. The Coast Guard works around the clock to keep the Central Coast safe &amp; it‚Äôs shameful that the Administration has not worked toward a compromise to pay these hardworking men and women. https://t.co/qvOgJhhdYP Over a week into this irresponsible government shutdown, Republican leadership has not called Congress back to negotiate and pass a spending deal. 

This leaves thousands of federal employees, including some servicemembers, wondering when they will receive their next paycheck. Mandatory health screenings are only a first step. I am demanding a full and thorough investigation by Congress into the failures that led to two children‚Äôs deaths. A second child has died while in federal custody, this time early on Christmas morning. Immigrants who come to the United States in search of a better life for themselves and their families deserve to be treated humanely and compassionately. https://t.co/Ogo3VuoQax Wishing you a healthy &amp; joyous Christmas. With many challenges facing our nation the world can feel overwhelming lately, but I hope this season provides an opportunity to reflect on the important things in our lives, and spend time with those who bring you comfort &amp; peace - Salud The @CHISNPS will remain accessible during the government shutdown, but emergency and rescue services will be limited and the mainland visitor center will be closed. Visitors are advised to use extreme caution during their visit. Read more: https://t.co/kVXAeov0yL With just four days until Christmas, our federal employees deserve assurance that they will not lose pay during the #TrumpShutdown. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve cosponsored @RepDonBeyer‚Äôs legislation to ensure all federal employees will receive retroactive pay. https://t.co/bWgAEdp1vQ Nearly 420,000 federal employees ‚Äì including law enforcement, TSA screeners, Forest Service firefighters &amp; others ‚Äì are forced to go without pay during the holidays as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. Furloughed federal employees may never receive back-pay after the shutdown ends. I voted against wasteful spending for the wall and remain hopeful that Congress and the President can work together on a bipartisan basis to bring forward a clean spending bill to fund the government responsibly before tonight‚Äôs shutdown. The President‚Äôs senseless border wall is nothing more than an archaic solution to a 21st century problem and fails to meet our security needs at the border. The Senate passed a bipartisan spending bill, following an agreement w/ @POTUS, which funded the government through Feb. Instead of bringing that clean bill to a vote, House GOP conspired w/ Trump to add funding for a border wall, leading us toward a partial government shutdown. Everyone should feel safe from sexual harassment in their workplace, including congressional staff. I'm glad to see the critical reforms in the Congressional Accountability Act have passed through the House &amp; Senate on such a bipartisan basis. https://t.co/FCRjbKDiny For too long, corporate spending in campaigns has drowned out the voices of citizens. That's why I introduced the Corporate Political Disclosure Act, which requires publicly traded corporations to disclose political expenditures to the SEC. Read more: https://t.co/xLJq9f2saW Foreign interference &amp; dark money have plagued our elections, weakening the power of voters. I‚Äôm glad the Senate overturned the @USTreasury's move allowing special interests to hide their donors from the IRS &amp; am proud to support the House version of the bill. https://t.co/i3FAw4SeQe .@BetsyDeVosED's School Safety Report refuses to address the role that easily accessible firearms play in school shootings. 

Instead of arming teachers &amp; blaming anti-discrimination guidelines, we need to implement measures that are proven to prevent gun violence &amp; save lives. https://t.co/1CUVFSC0qY Joined @RedCross last week to write letters to our servicemembers stationed in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. I‚Äôm thankful for all the sacrifices our service members &amp; their families make every day, and I‚Äôm thinking of them as they spend their holidays far away from home. #HolidaysforHeroes https://t.co/EBWFAwXQBl Despite repeated attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, access to comprehensive health insurance has brought peace of mind to families across the Central Coast. 

Sign up for coverage by 1/15!

I encourage everyone on the Central Coast to renew their plan or sign up for coverage before the January 15th deadline. Read more about my work to protect and improve the ACA: https://t.co/GhUeFhqrV5 The ACA expanded access to affordable health care for millions of Americans. Despite this, @potus and GOP leadership have sought to undermine the ACA at every turn. While I‚Äôm disappointed in today‚Äôs ruling, I will keep fighting to preserve the ACA &amp; it‚Äôs protections. BREAKING: A federal court judge in Texas has ruled the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions unconstitutional. https://t.co/yPG72ihPvF Six years ago today, 20 elementary school children &amp; 6 staff members were killed at #SandyHook. Sadly, the gun violence epidemic has touched countless more lives since. 
 
Let's honor the victims with action to ensure that no more families lose loved ones far too soon. This tragedy underscores the crisis unfolding between desperate asylum seekers &amp; inhumane immigration policies. I will push Congress &amp; the Inspector General to investigate the unacceptable failures that led to this child dying in CBP custody. We must do better as a nation. https://t.co/Jknh8smqKP Our 1st day in Congress @RepJackyRosen &amp; I bonded over the last bologna sandwich left over after a long day. I caught up w/ Jacky to reminisce and split one last bologna sandwich before she heads over to the big leagues representing the people of Nevada in the US Senate! https://t.co/zrrtmkVpRu TODAY from 5-8pm, @BOEM_DOI is hosting a community meeting in San Luis Obispo to share information about offshore wind developments along the CA coast. üëá

https://t.co/dHGNp6ZyuN While it's disappointing that the GOP majority has refused to address the critical labor shortage, yesterday's #FarmBill offers positive and collaborative assurance to our farmers at a time when escalating trade tensions has created uncertainty in the industry. https://t.co/HhQHZTNRXo I'm proud to support this strong #FarmBill, which includes funding for research and crop insurance programs for specialty crops grown on the Central Coast, provides funding for forest management to help prevent wildfires in CA, and invests in important conservation efforts. https://t.co/zIjOItZLen I voted YES on yesterday's bipartisan #FarmBill, which benefits Central Coast farmers &amp; maintains important nutrition programs like #SNAP which families rely on to put food on the table and keep their families healthy. https://t.co/yg7jBV9V7j When @POTUS abandoned the #ParisAgreement last year, he abdicated the US‚Äôs role as a global leader on #ClimateChange. We need immediate action to ensure our children &amp; communities have a healthy future. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/JB721T88Wf Gave my Republican buddy, @RepDonBacon, his Christmas present today ‚Äì a bottle of Central Coast wine! #HappyHolidays https://t.co/FhNn8e2cud Rolling back the Clean Water Act would mean exposing drinking water sources for millions to pollution, putting our public health at risk. Clean water is vital to a healthy community and prosperous economy &amp; I will continue fighting to #ProtectCleanWater. https://t.co/GvVylcZH0G After facing extinction in the wild more than 30 years ago, the first successfully fledged condor on the Central Coast took flight over the Los Padres National Forest today.

It was a privilege to join residents &amp; veterans for the wreath-laying ceremony at the Freedom Monument Veterans Memorial this weekend. https://t.co/Q8Bc2RAdMZ https://t.co/tJ7bkAUxo6 I wrote to @USOPM and, building on a long community-led campaign, asked that they increase SLO‚Äôs locality pay, so it is on par w/ workers in nearby counties. I‚Äôm happy to announce OPM has granted this request. https://t.co/NLoSvwnnnS It's difficult to attract talented employees to local agencies like @DeptVetAffairs &amp; @SocialSecurity when locality pay on the #CentralCoast is lower than nearby areas. Yesterday, a vet called my office &amp; said staffing shortages have meant longer waits at every VA appt he‚Äôs had. Today, we mourn the 2,403 heroes who lost their lives in the #PearlHarbor attack 77 years ago. We honor all those who served that day and throughout World War II. We will never forget their sacrifice. https://t.co/ljVA4jBqaI Volunteers needed! Join a door-to-door campaign to notify and prepare residents in storm risk areas for possible evacuation.

Sign up here: https://t.co/vx5yzM8kvL https://t.co/14A6LtZ5SP Nearly two years ago, I introduced the California Clean Coast Act to prohibit offshore oil and gas exploration in California. Today, I joined a bipartisan letter opposing offshore drilling and exploration on the Atlantic Coast. https://t.co/tGPvmWLDxP https://t.co/uX8mzOWDrf Seismic testing is not only harmful to local marine life, but also paves the way for oil &amp; gas drilling in the Atlantic. The Central Coast knows first-hand the risk this poses to the environmental and economic well-being of coastal communities.https://t.co/xJkDBWqTwF I‚Äôm thrilled to see four wines produced on the Central Coast among @WineEnthusiast‚Äôs top 100 wines in the world! Congratulations to the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County wineries and vineyards who earned this prestigious honor. https://t.co/pYxtvj49wv Bernard McNamee has a dirty track record of preferential treatment toward the fossil fuel industry &amp; even celebrated Earth Day this year with a pro-fossil fuel op-ed.

He is unfit to serve as the @FERC Commissioner and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject his nomination. https://t.co/EII4AfL3CZ The Central Coast knows that oil spills wreak havoc on surrounding communities. That's why my first bill was the California Clean Coast Act, to prohibit offshore oil &amp; gas exploration in CA. 

I will continue advocating for clean energy &amp; restrictions on harmful offshore drilling .@POTUS is paving the way for oil &amp; gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, reflecting a complete disregard for the refuge‚Äôs fragile ecosystem. https://t.co/isy1oFft1Y Jeeps &amp; Peeps (my family‚Äôs rescue cats) are happy to hear that I received a 100% on the Humane Society‚Äôs Scorecard this year!

My thoughts are with President Bush‚Äôs family and loved ones. Our nation was strengthened by President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs legacy of service, from his deployment overseas in WWII, to his term in the Oval Office, he spent nearly 70 years in service to our country. #ClimateChange could cost us more than $100 billion each year by the end of the century and the White House has tried to bury these findings. Ignoring the reality of climate change jeopardizes the health and wealth of the American people. #ClimateFriday https://t.co/Hx8oDyguV5
