We must NOT support wasting billions on an ineffective wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.

Today, 12 House Republicans voted with us to fund and re-open Transportation and HUD.  10 voted to fund and re-open Agriculture and the SNAP program.

Trump and Senate Republicans should stop holding the health, safety and paychecks of the American people hostage, and re-open government immediately. Reminder that while House Democrats have been totally unified on key votes to fund the government, eight House Republicans voted with us today to re-open the Treasury and IRS.

The Republicans are divided, not us. 67 million. 

That‚Äôs how many women and girls in America live with pre-existing conditions.  

I‚Äôm proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats in ensuring the GOP does not stand in the way of that care. We Democrats support funding smart, effective border security to keep our nation safe.

What we don‚Äôt support is an ineffective and expensive border wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.  

We don‚Äôt need a 5th Century solution to a 21st Century problem. Reminder: all we Democrats are asking for is to re-open the government now, and for Senate Republicans to pass legislation that they already passed before.

Chrissy and I look forward to working with you to keep the California Dream alive and well. https://t.co/3ZuVGw2u9o Trump is creating a mess, literally.

Carbon emissions increased by 3.4% in 2018 marking the second largest annual gain in more than two decades. All we Democrats are asking for is to re-open the government, and for Senate Republicans to pass legislation that they already passed once before. Whether it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúconcrete wall‚Äù or a ‚Äústeel barrier,‚Äù it‚Äôs still ineffective ‚Äî and Mexico still isn‚Äôt paying for it. Don‚Äôt believe anyone who tells you that you can‚Äôt protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time.

In California, we‚Äôve made great progress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while experiencing excellent growth in GDP and per capita income. Trump declaring an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù over his wall would be an unconstitutional abuse of his powers as commander in chief.

He has completely failed to make the case that our national security requires his wall.

The House should repudiate any such emergency declaration immediately. Reminder that while House Democrats were unified on two key votes to fund the government last week, five House Republicans voted with us on one bill and seven supported the other bill.

The Republicans are divided, not us. RT @fred_guttenberg: We finally are getting leadership on gun violence prevention.

https://t.co/Ps6eVIGN3L RT @AdamSchiff: A good man resigns as Defense Secretary,

The acting Attorney General ignores the advice of ethics lawyers,

And the govern‚Ä¶ It is time for a #GreenNewDeal that can help save our planet and create new green jobs across the country. 

Read this summary and call on your elected officials to support bold climate change legislation in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/VdsuL3QKNA Reminder that Democrats have offered Republicans THREE options to keep government open ‚Äî but @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan are deciding to drive our nation into a pointless, destructive #TrumpShutdown over the holidays. Honored to spend some time this afternoon with my friend @tashaboerner, new CA State Assemblymember for #AD76, which overlaps with much of #CA49.  Great to see her new Assembly District office.  Many opportunities to work together for the residents of North County San Diego! https://t.co/rlDgWdPwub Trump really thinks he knows more than the generals do.

No surprise all of the generals surrounding him have had enough. The president‚Äôs decision to move forward with a #TrumpShutdown over his immoral and ineffective wall hurts people all over our country and creates chaos.

@realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan appear incapable of doing the right thing. I‚Äôm proud to have been among the first members of Congress to support the #GreenNewDeal.  There‚Äôs no time to wait.  Excited to work with @sunrisemvmt and my new colleagues to bring these ideas into action.  https://t.co/7f9VyLuRht Reminder that the Attorney General represents the people, not the president.

We must not accept an AG who will use their newfound power to undermine the Mueller investigation. The new Congress must pass a resolution ending US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.  This is a humanitarian disaster and we must reassert Congressional authority under the War Powers Act.  https://t.co/KFgKuiV2eL @AyannaPressley @KatieHill4CA Thank you Ayanna! Anyone who criticizes so-called ‚Äújudicial activism‚Äù or ‚Äúlegislating from the bench‚Äù and then supports the ridiculous decision by a Texas court against the Affordable Care Act is a massive hypocrite. https://t.co/jU9pXstcQX This is awesome.  Honored to be serving soon with both @KatieHill4CA and @AyannaPressley.  https://t.co/UVceofmXya RT @the_dol: Excited to be celebrating @MikeLevinCA‚Äôs win with other folks from the 49th. Still hard to believe we did it. It‚Äôs already so‚Ä¶ I could not be more honored than to have these three members of Congress as my new colleagues.

@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler and @RepCummings are all amazing leaders who will do an incredible job.

It‚Äôs time the American people know the truth.
https://t.co/dFQbP3EVqV RT @SDNorthEDC: A great group of North County employees met with congressman-elect Levin yesterday.  Part of what @SDNorthEDC does is facil‚Ä¶ Honored to sit down today with some of the most important local leaders in North County San Diego‚Äôs economy to discuss innovation and job growth in #CA49. https://t.co/mPKcA78tEm Dear @realDonaldTrump,

Democrats presented you with clear options to keep the government open.

Almost a week later, you still have no response and no plan.

We don‚Äôt want your #TrumpShutdown. I‚Äôm excited to announce some of the talented and experienced individuals who will serve as our key staff members for the new Congress.
 
Can‚Äôt wait to get started with our new chief Kara van Stralen, District Director Francine Busby, and the entire team!
https://t.co/gbzEPFKp12 https://t.co/W53FadNhXu Here in California, we will vigorously defend the Affordable Care Act and continue to fight for affordable and quality health care for all! https://t.co/VruApZC5xP Just 17 days until we‚Äôre sworn in to the 116th Congress.  I‚Äôm honored to be serving along with some of the most talented people I‚Äôve ever met.

We‚Äôve worked very hard to get to this point. But make no mistake ‚Äî the real work starts on January 3rd. Great weekend with my wonderful wife!  So thankful to her for all of her support! https://t.co/CdIGJYRWSk Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is the latest Trump official to exit an administration plagued by a #CultureOfCorruption.

Zinke also will be remembered for his wanton disregard for our environment + public lands.

The American people deserve better than this.  

We‚Äôll be watching. @RL_Miller @katieporteroc @HarleyRouda LOL
