https://t.co/gPBOec8S1Z No, @kyrstensinema won because she ran a good race and had a message that resonated with Arizona's voters. The sooner we Republicans recognize this, the sooner we will we be in a position to win the next contest. https://t.co/iMNwvMWxKJ There should be no place in politics for language like this. Pointing out that the President also speaks crudely is no defense. We should be better. https://t.co/UX5jkPuN2T Honored to escort my friend ⁦@MartinHeinrich⁩ to the Well of the Senate to be sworn in for his second term, and glad that we mutually agreed not to wear our island attire #rivalsurvival https://t.co/90GZSieHov Great to be in the Senate Chamber today as history was made, with @kyrstensinema and @MarthaMcSally being sworn in the two new Senators from Arizona. Our state will be well represented. Ultimately, we're on the same team. There are good people on both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/RnJ6tKqJY8 A thoughtful piece by incoming Senator Romney. https://t.co/pKO0wXgbLw I’ve lived in countries where the Head of State has used the central bank for political purposes. Please respect the Fed’s independence, Mr. President. https://t.co/lVzV8gyf64 Just voted to keep govt funding negotiations open with leaders of both parties agreeing not to call for additional procedural or test votes until a final deal is reached between House, Senate and WHite House. The Senate filibuster is about the only mechanism left in Washington that brings the parties together. Deploying the nuclear option would blow that up. I will not vote to do it. https://t.co/XDL19fuSMP I appreciate the hard work of ⁦@ChrisCoons⁩ and ⁦@CoryBooker⁩ to protect the Special Counsel. I’m sure they will carry on the effort in the new Congress https://t.co/VdgdXk8DDK Republicans need to get serious about climate change. That’s why I introduced a revenue-neutral carbon tax bill in the House several years ago. Today, @ChrisCoons &amp; I have introduced a  bipartisan, revenue-neutral carbon tax bill that provides an honest path to clean energy. Homerun agreement between @MLB, @MLB_PLAYERS and Cuban Baseball Federation. This deal will make life better for Cuban baseball players, who will no longer have to risk unsafe passage to the U.S. to play in the @MLB.
https://t.co/wN5OPoLpww At 2:50pm today, @ChrisCoons, @SenBooker, and I will once again ask the Senate to immediately pass S. 2644, the bipartisan bill to protect the Special Counsel. https://t.co/QqzHM770Gy Tonight in the Senate we passed the First Step Act, the first major overhaul of our criminal justice system in decades. Special thanks go to @chuckgrassley @senatordurbin @senmikelee and @senbooker for their hard work on this big bipartisan victory Congrats to @RepMcSally on her appointment to the U.S. Senate. Arizona will be well served. The Senate Intelligence Committee has, in a bipartisan manner, commissioned a report detailing Russian efforts to undermine the Mueller investigation. We have a bill to protect the investigation from White House interference. The Senate needs to pass it. https://t.co/9DcJonqrJ4 Arizona has been fortunate to have the firm, steady and capable leadership of Senator Jon Kyl for many years, both in and out of public office. This is a good man.  https://t.co/Uji3Ty59c8 Filled with gratitude as I delivered my farewell address today. Special thanks to @senatemajldr, @ChrisCoons, @SenatorCollins, @SenatorDurbin, Sen. Kyl, and all of my friends and colleagues for their kind remarks. https://t.co/k0lgc7RVE7 Hey @TheDailyShow, how can I get one of these blankets? https://t.co/tkvPmsdajA Full of gratitude today as I deliver my farewell address in the Senate Chamber at 11:00 EST Kudos to Time Magazine for highlighting free press  “Guardians” as Person of the Year. Despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. https://t.co/yD1CNr34WO Important words from a bipartisan group of former Senators
https://t.co/moZ7rebMOh Farewell to a wonderful friend and colleague, former Congressman Ed Pastor. Arizona has been blessed for your service https://t.co/Kxlc3ZPgq9 The Senate needs to protect the Special Counsel. https://t.co/079ufYjtzn What a beautiful service for a wonderful man. https://t.co/ByVj3Z7IQq Well said, Mr President. https://t.co/CVQerqotMT What a privilege it has been to visit the Capitol Rotunda over the past two days to see so many Americans willing to wait hours outside in the cold pay tribute to President George H.W. Bush https://t.co/SPAUL1tqC3 I'm grateful today for George H.W. Bush, who helped usher in freedom around the world while yearning for kindler, gentler politics here at home. https://t.co/nkRU3kIZB2 So sorry to hear of the death of George H.W. Bush tonight. We all owe a debt of gratitude for his honorable and humble service to the nation, and for his enduring example of kindness. Heartfelt condolences to the entire Bush family. Cheryl and I send our deepest condolences to the family and colleagues of the US Marshal killed in Tucson last night. This is a tragic loss for Arizona's law enforcement community. https://t.co/p0AuGelybh Nope, just pairing my vote with colleague who couldn’t be here because of a family emergency. I’ll vote no on final passage next week. https://t.co/5M3ivIUQTt So sorry to learn of the passing  of former Rep. Ed Pastor. I had the privilege of serving with Ed for more than a decade. There was no one more capable, hardworking and kind. Arizona is a far better place because of Ed Pastor. Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to finish his investigation. Tomorrow, Sen. @ChrisCoons and I will again call for unanimous consent to bring S. 2644, which will protect the Special Counsel, to the Senate floor for a vote. https://t.co/HgPMo6Iu6X “Great allies” don’t plot the murder of journalists, Mr. President. “Great allies” don’t lure their own citizens into a trap, then kill them.  https://t.co/PY6qOOIOI6 My thoughts on Freedom of the Press, as delivered at last week's Radio and Television Correspondents Association dinner @rtcacaphill https://t.co/ugPb7vkFjf From my window this morning. Winter is coming. https://t.co/lXXN7TlZta I have informed the Majority Leader that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting action on the floor, until the Mueller protection bill is brought to the full Senate for a vote. What a gracious concession speech, @MarthaMcSally. You've done Arizona proud. https://t.co/uZgSYkHdTp Congratulations to @kyrstensinema on a race well run, and won. It’s been a wonderful honor representing Arizona in the Senate. You’ll be great. There is no evidence of election officials "cooking the books" in Arizona. Such careless language undermines confidence in our democratic institutions. https://t.co/cNjYp0yIa1 There is no evidence of "electoral corruption" in Arizona, Mr. President. Thousands of dedicated Arizonans work in a non-partisan fashion every election cycle to ensure that every vote is counted. We appreciate their service. https://t.co/Xtd5Vd0gSu When the Senate convenes next week, @ChrisCoons and I will ask for unanimous consent to bring S.2644, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, to a vote on the Senate floor. After the firing of The AG, it is more important than ever to protect the Special Counsel. Jeff Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself nearly two years ago. He has paid a heavy price for his independence ever since. We owe him a debt of gratitude. Earlier this year, we passed S.2644, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would safeguard Robert Mueller’s investigation. Leader McConnell should bring the bill to the Senate floor as soon as possible Post election thoughts  https://t.co/L0769vqk7r Amidst it all, we visited in AZ tonight with  those who are caring for asylum seekers. I was told “Let the politicians do what they will, just let us be Jesus.”  Thank you, Elizabeth and Magdalena, for a lesson in charity. https://t.co/6OIdNEqknL This is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it. https://t.co/5sftOt57pI I prefer Ronald Reagan's "city on a hill" view, where immigrants are a blessing, not a burden https://t.co/v1hAfMVliP https://t.co/YjiqJOqtTo He can’t do this, and he shouldn’t do this https://t.co/f7QUQrOa2n This is a good first step. https://t.co/YkLl2hgQjD I sent the attached letter to @USAGMgov CEO @JohnLansing today and appreciate his prompt response to the matter: https://t.co/ojdv1RrRd0  I will follow this investigation closely. Anti-semitism can have no place in government. https://t.co/DfWmRIdy8J TV Marti director says its program on George Soros lacked “balance.” Sorry, there is no balance that makes anti-Semitism right. BBG must investigate how such programming was produced and and why it aired. https://t.co/Ia01yuiKcB A TV Marti program that was introduced with the phrase, “George Soros, a multimillionaire Jew,” was paid for by the American taxpayer, and broadcast to Latin America last summer, in our name. This is taxpayer-funded anti-semitism. I don't know that I've ever heard a more callous statement https://t.co/B6bunxDWqv Grateful for FBI and other law enforcement agencies for their effective work and for their professionalism  https://t.co/9aKC1gTgZM We have too many real enemies abroad to be making enemies of our political opponents at home. We’ve got to be better than this.  https://t.co/ayJCTI2Kck A smart and insightful piece from a thoughtful Senator https://t.co/HDZnNAxp5F Body slamming journalists is nothing to be proud of https://t.co/q8NDMZfjYk This is reprehensible https://t.co/TvPEvJvaH5 This is not a close call, Secretary Mnuchin. Don't go to Riyadh https://t.co/MRzRz68rjM The President has it precisely backward. The free press is not the enemy of the people. Despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot's enemy. https://t.co/Tn0Za5h4lY Thoughtful piece by ⁦@MaxBoot⁩ about the plight of conservatives in today’s GOP https://t.co/7R2Qryu8HL Secretary Mnuchin should not be going to Riyadh. I will speak about tomorrow’s hearing on the Senate Floor at 1:15pm One of life’s great days https://t.co/MsQr8ERvFx Your sources are not accurate. I will not be voting "present" https://t.co/EqMGetXmRT Progress on a Judiciary Committee hearing is being made. This is good. https://t.co/spHDMebWgg This is sickening. No one should make light of this situation. https://t.co/G7rlT3IKTQ When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so. I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice. Speaking on the senate floor momentarily on the importance of AG Jeff Sessions holding his job and continuing to assert independence when the President asks him to protect his friends and go after his enemies Remembering those who lost their lives on 9/11, and those who have given their all to keep us safe ever since. So happy to have Senator Kyl back in familiar surroundings. https://t.co/ym0dGapGQl Governor Ducey has selected Senator Jon Kyl as Senator McCain’s replacement. What an excellent choice! There is no one more qualified and Arizona is well served. Kudos to Senator Kyl for his willingness to serve once again. This is not the conduct of a President committed to defending and upholding the constitution, but rather a President looking to use the Department of Justice to settle political scores. https://t.co/E74YmhD4dB I watched them lay my friend to rest today.

We invite everyone to line the route to honor John &amp; the McCain Family https://t.co/iDVqaqyEnj https://t.co/9GaW2yOe6W What a wonderful service at the Arizona State Capitol this morning honoring Senator McCain https://t.co/NzFfvzJkjQ Congratulations to @kyrstensinema and @RepMcSally for winning their respective primary races last night. This seat is now reserved for the first female senator in Arizona's history. How cool is that! Sorry, @realDonaldTrump. I made no endorsement in this race. I think the last endorsement I made was in the Alabama race.

The world has lost a hero and a statesman. Cindy and the McCain family have lost a loving husband and father. I have lost a wonderful friend. God bless and keep this wonderful man and his family @SenJohnMcCain There's a danger in conducting foreign policy by tweet after viewing a single press report. First, land reforms have been proposed in parliament in South Africa, but not yet adopted. Second, there is no "large scale killing of farmers" going on in South Africa. https://t.co/lpdyNIEH7V Pleased to cosponsor this amendment. Granting/revoking security clearances should not be a political exercise. https://t.co/RmOwJtOhAY This kind of language is unbecoming of a President of the United States.

The people of Zimbabwe have endured enough. It’s time for a new era of peace and prosperity. Honored to meet with both major presidential candidates Emmerson Mnangagwa and Nelson Chamisa this morning. We look forward to the results being announced and continued progress toward a democratic and prosperous future for Zimbabwe https://t.co/4OEo4mtEA1 Counting ballots in a tent in rural Zimbabwe by kerosine and candlelight.

I write about it on Medium, under the title "What's right with America" https://t.co/yhMLHzGZyL Speaking on Senate floor in just a couple of minutes on bipartisan resolution regarding Helsinki Summit The Russian ambassador says that "important verbal agreements" were reached at the Helsinki summit.  What are those commitments, Mr. President? Congress needs to know. Just intro’d a resolution with @ChrisCoons reaffirming Senate support for the Intel Community’s assessment of Russian attacks and dismissing the denial of Vladimir Putin. Tomorrow on the Senate floor we will ask for unanimous consent to pass it.  
https://t.co/2b2olRDwbi What am I doing, this pig can’t even read. https://t.co/Bi3PEAG25S I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression. This is shameful. Mr. President, as today’s indictments reaffirm, election interference is not a question to be asked of Vladimir Putin, but a statement to be made to Vladimir Putin: You interfered in our elections. My thoughts on the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin https://t.co/UZD8HCundr At approximate 2:00pm EDT I will deliver a senate floor speech titled Friends, Foes &amp; Peace When we were attacked on 9/11, our NATO allies rushed to our defense. They have remained stedfast ever since, sacrificing thousands of lives in Afghanistan over these many years to keep us safe. I hope they know how much we appreciate their commitment and friendship. By a vote of 88-11, the senate just took the first step to rein in the President’s abuse of trade authority by using national security as justification to levy tariffs. FINALLY, Senate will push back on the President’s abuse of Section 232 to impose tariffs. We will vote Wednesday on a “Motion to Instruct,” a first step toward reasserting Congress’s constitutional role on tariffs. Again, nobody wins trade wars https://t.co/pT8Svz1pQk Our bipartisan, bicameral delegation was greeted warmly by Finland’s President in Turku this morning with homegrown rhubarb juice. We thanked President Niinisto for Finland’s strong and enduring friendship with the United States.

Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.” - Henry Van Dyke Grateful to our NATO allies like Latvia, with whom we share a commitment to security and prosperity. https://t.co/QzOGzsjiJU We shouldn't be picking winners and losers here.
https://t.co/kT9K9neOIA This is so wrong, Mr. President.
