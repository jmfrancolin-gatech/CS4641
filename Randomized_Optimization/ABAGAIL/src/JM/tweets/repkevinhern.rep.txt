Even more alarming is that they don't offer a solid plan on how to pay for these monstrous, socialist plans. 

@HouseDemocrats are out of touch and out of their depth with their plans for the #GreenNewDeal A few of the absurd points are to eliminate air travel completely, upgrade or replace EVERY building in the United States of America, plant "lots" of trees, and put charging stations "everywhere".
#GreenNewDeal This isn't a parody, this is the real text of their proposal.
#GreenNewDeal Don't take my word for it, here are some direct quotes:

"we aren't sure we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast..." 
&amp;
"the question isn't how we'll pay for it, but what we'll do with our new shared prosperity"
#GreenNewDeal This morning, the @HouseDemocrats released the framework for their #GreenNewDeal and it is a travesty.

It's so radical that even @SpeakerPelosi won't touch it.

Instead of staying here and working to reopen the government, @SpeakerPelosi canceled votes for tomorrow and sent Members home early today. How are we supposed to reopen the government when Congress isn't working? Just gave a speech on the House floor calling out @HouseDemocrats for voting against a measure to fund the paychecks for federal employees who have been impacted by the partial #shutdown.

Did you catch the interview? https://t.co/2JvkY8sIrA When will we say enough is enough? More than ever, border security is my priority as we work to reopen the government and take care of the American people. This sad news of a police officer in California killed by an illegal immigrant is just another instance where Democrat policies - like sanctuary cities and open borders - are protecting criminals instead of the American people. Once again, hardworking Americans are put in danger because of our inability to control illegal entry at our borders. 
https://t.co/1nsLRgGkFv I hope this incentivizes my colleagues in Congress to make the safety of Americans their top priority. Members of Congress should not be paid during that time either. If we can’t come to an agreement on government funding and there is a lapse in appropriations, hundreds of thousands of federal employees around the country will be furloughed or working without pay. I’m proud to introduce a bill with my colleagues - in the event of a shutdown, Members of Congress should not get paid.

(2/3) This needless waste of taxpayer dollars must end. The never-ending political circus in Washington has been fueled by this fruitless investigation, deepening the divides between our lawmakers. (1/3) Since Robert Mueller began investigating @realDonaldTrump, it has cost the American taxpayers over $300,000 a week - adding up to $25 million.
After 19 months of this, it's clear the investigation is going nowhere.
