Missing paychecks, vandalized national parks, and a disruption of vital services in Indian Country are the real consequences of Trump's failure to lead. https://t.co/cOYFaEl5U2 The Tohono O'odham tribe in my district in #AZ03 has members on both sides of the border, and Trump's unnecessary wall would cut then off from their sacred sites and their traditional homeland. One of the many reasons I will not support a border wall. https://t.co/nEte9tYHcE Does the Trump administration ever put the needs of everyday Americans before their corporate pals? While 800,000 federal workers aren't getting paid, the Trump administration still has time to help their special interests friends during the shutdown.  https://t.co/8tn7cVGJE6 Under the #TrumpShutdown, critical food security, health programs, and law enforcement on tribal lands are running out of money and imperiling the lives of our Native brothers and sisters. It's time for Senate Republicans and Trump to reopen the govt. https://t.co/u5AqLJRBuh The only crisis at the border is the one created by Donald Trump.

The #TrumpShutdown has to end. #MyShutdownStory https://t.co/L3fMiI8kpW The Senate must act as a coequal branch of government, pass the House spending bills that Senate Republicans previously supported, and reopen the government. AZ Dems are busy working #ForThePeople for the 7000+ federal workers in Arizona who begin missing paychecks today. https://t.co/4AiMmQqAWo As federal employees go without their paychecks today, it is worth reminding that @realDonaldTrump has a long and well-documented history of stiffing American workers for his personal gain. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/B95woV43Dw RT @AppropsDems: Chairman of Natural Resources Committee @RepRaulGrijalva: Trash cans are overflowing.

It's time for Trump to #EndTheShutdown and reopen the government. https://t.co/yg16LzXw6c Trash is piling up, parks are left unstaffed, and our national treasures are being left open to looting and vandalism. The #TrumpShutdown is causing irreparable damage to our national parks and public lands, and they should be closed during the shutdown. https://t.co/I7RtLtcNny RT @NRDems: We‚Äôre fighting to #StopTheShutdown and oppose President Trump‚Äôs harmful border wall. #NoBorderWall #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/‚Ä¶ Plain and simple, a border wall doesn‚Äôt work. If anyone who has visited a hardware store can breach Trump‚Äôs border wall, we should have serious concerns about the President‚Äôs vision for border security. #NoBorderWall https://t.co/GVn5rUqbdU 'Host a garage sale' is an unacceptable response to our nation's Coast Guard employees currently facing missing paychecks due to the #TrumpShutdown. For someone who claims to love the military, Trump is happy to use them as collateral for his useless wall. https://t.co/wjGjtI5Vve The only national emergency that merits immediate attention is the unhinged President who currently occupies the White House and refuses to put forth policy solutions that are grounded in facts. https://t.co/ezNpvuSIFz #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown Millions of Americans are facing hardship due to the #TrumpShutdown and I want to hear your story. Follow the link below and share your story with me. #MyShutdownStory https://t.co/ENzgO0MmXz Trump's monument to his racist policies isn't just a massive waste of money, it's an environmental hazard. It will destroy precious ecosystems, increase flooding in the borderlands, and cause irreparable harm to some of our public lands. #NoBorderWall https://t.co/u5u2Z8RLYU RT @NRDems: This is the same president who threatens to withhold #California #wildfire recovery money unless he gets his way on forest poli‚Ä¶ Border communities don't need a President who only goes to the border for photo ops to tell them what their communities need--especially when it comes to his vanity wall. Border security starts with modernizing our ports of entry, not a border wall. https://t.co/AQgpP44a7L Access to health care is a matter of life and death. It's why I voted to defend the Affordable Care Act today and protect those with preexisting conditions, safeguard essential benefits, and ensure access and affordability for everyone. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/NpycnwwaNw Terrorists are not coming over the Southern border, despite repeated lies peddled by Trump administration officials. Experts and government agencies agree that the Southern border poses no imminent national security threat. #NoBorderWall https://t.co/0oHVzFo2iB More than 800,000 federal workers this week will begin missing paychecks thanks to Trump's billion dollar boondoggle that shut down the government. These are real people, with real bills, and families to provide for. https://t.co/IcxPhTFZgA I tried to fact-check the President during his fear-mongering address, but there were too many lies to keep track of. See for yourself why there's no crisis at our border other than the one Trump has created. https://t.co/VSItHiKTTD Trump chose fear over facts in last night's embarrassing address to the nation to make the case for his ego wall--and the American people aren't buying it. Not a single cent should go to funding Trump's monument to hate. https://t.co/WZar7bUoFS The myth of the insecure border is one of the greatest &amp; most dangerous falsehoods promoted by Trump, and is about as factual as his claims that Mexico will pay for his border wall. 

There are better ways to secure the border that don't involve a wall. My statement: https://t.co/ze3e5iUWhL The President and his cronies traffic in falsehoods when it comes to characterizing our immigration system, asylum seekers, and the borderlands. Immigrants are less likely than the general population to commit crimes. https://t.co/PnE2eN9BxJ #TrumpAddress FACT:  Every member of Congress in the House of Representatives who represents border districts‚Äîboth Republican and Democrat‚Äîoppose Trump‚Äôs plan to build a border wall on our Southern border.  Why? Because it doesn't work. https://t.co/h1b9ClHUt4 #TrumpAddress A border wall will not stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, where smuggling groups often use the legal ports of entry. Any attempt to link a border wall and the opioid crisis is wrong. https://t.co/b5zEhERUGL #TrumpAddress Trump‚Äôs decision to shut down the government over his #BorderWall remains extremely unpopular with the American public. Continuing to secure our border should not come at the expense of hardworking federal employees and their families. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Tng8PHhhu9 I remember the six lives lost from our Tucson community eight years ago to senseless gun violence. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a proud supporter of bipartisan common-sense public safety legislation like #HR8 that will help keep our communities safe. https://t.co/6dcuuooTmI The American people voted to reject the corrupt &amp; hate-filled politics of Trump and endorsed a vision of democracy free from special interests where everyone has an equal vote and and an equal voice. #HR1 will help the govt work #ForThePeople again. https://t.co/D9AoYwEAbD Small businesses across the country are suffering due to the #TrumpShutdown.  With approximately 800,000 furloughed or working without pay, small firms will feel the ripple effect and lose revenue. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/70lBYunoQP RT @NRDems: The American people don‚Äôt want oil rigs on every coastal beach &amp; our economy doesn‚Äôt need them. Today Chair @RepRaulGrijalva pr‚Ä¶ Protecting public lands, clean air &amp; clean water are some of my top priorities as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. No longer will Interior Dept. get away with putting the interests of the extraction industries over those of the American people. https://t.co/Y4ytUIXqbN Eight years ago, six lives were lost and numerous people injured in a vicious attack on the Tucson community. I'm looking forward to cosponsoring this legislation and keeping our communities safe from gun violence. #EndGunViolence #HR8 https://t.co/kJ9cvmVrNh RT @GabbyGiffords: I‚Äôm in Washington today, but my heart is in Tucson. Eight years ago, six lives were stolen outside a Safeway. I was shot‚Ä¶ Arkansas's Medicaid work requirements have upended the lives of nearly 17,000 people who lost health coverage for no good reason. Arizona's families deserve better. CMS should deny Arizona's misguided request to implement work requirements. https://t.co/nIwtWUfpDA The ripple effect of the #TrumpShutdown isn't just affecting federal workers--it's affecting communities across the country. Furloughed workers are spending less in their communities, and that means less for small business owners who depend on that income. https://t.co/biqFOW19lB Did President Trump just realize that the #TrumpShutdown is negatively impacting our public lands? It's time for him to stop holding national park funding hostage for his ridiculous border wall. https://t.co/3b8UyU6J8z #NoBorderWall Border security starts at modernizing our ports of entry--not Trump's useless border wall. By slowing down the asylum process and not focusing on customs staff, Trump has helped create the crisis he loves to complain about.  https://t.co/ciTD4Rt2m9 #NoBorderWall
