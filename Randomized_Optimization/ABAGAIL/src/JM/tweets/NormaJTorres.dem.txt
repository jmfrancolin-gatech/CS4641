For the second week in a row, my Democratic House colleagues and I have voted to reopen the gov‚Äôt--with Republican language that already passed the Senate. Mr. President, let‚Äôs reopen the gov‚Äôt and get the American people back to work. https://t.co/scdxBfAKgq In case you think the #TrumpShutdown doesn‚Äôt affect you, the @US_FDA currently can't inspect our food supply. https://t.co/5Gz4zJdwiP CALIFORNIA: El √∫ltimo d√≠a para inscribirse en la cobertura de salud a trav√©s de @CoveredCA_es es el 15 de enero.

That‚Äôs why our rules are already fulfilling our promise to clean up‚Ä¶ This National #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay. I‚Äôm thankful for the hundreds of officers across the 35th District and across the nation who work tirelessly to make our communities safer. https://t.co/KDrFRELBpm RT @AmerQuarterly: Guatemala is staring down a constitutional crisis. Washington shouldn't stay silent, writes Congresswoman @NormaJTorres,‚Ä¶ Maybe you need a reminder, @realDonaldTrump. California is one of the 50 states that makes up America. 57% of our land is under federal jurisdiction. We pay more in taxes than we get back in federal spending. You don't have the power to deny us aid, like you did with Puerto Rico. https://t.co/fctf5CJW99 Last year, I introduced Savanna‚Äôs Act in the House to address the increasing epidemic of missing and murdered Native American women and girls. I'll keep pressing my Republican colleagues to take action this Congress to finally bring justice to these victims. https://t.co/bSQoiYzdPs Last week, I received a rent increase notice and my heart sunk. I thought about the 800K workers who must have received a similar notice but not a paycheck. I urge @realDonaldTrump, @SenateGOP &amp; @HouseGOP to end the #TrumpShutdown to bring financial stability back to families. https://t.co/Co7ePzugz9 .@CC_Guatemala, Guatemala‚Äôs highest court, has ruled to suspend the Morales administration‚Äôs attempt to expel @CICIGgt. If Guatemala is to remain a democracy, the government must respect the court‚Äôs decision and allow CICIG to finish its mandate. https://t.co/B8KzrzCKtN RT @SBCUSDPOLICE: Today, is  #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay and @SB_CitySchools take time to sport a little #blue and let your #SRO know th‚Ä¶ RT @jclopezcnn: Congresista @NormaJTorres apoya decisi√≥n de la ONU de respetar acuerdo sobre Cicig https://t.co/KFYB6hw6KD via @CNNee The Trump Administration did nothing to stop the erosion of the rule of law in Guatemala. Now it is ‚Äúconcerned.‚Äù Incredibly weak. https://t.co/Fm0ujbp8k5 Once again, the President took to the airwaves to lie to the American people with his message of hatred and division.

We must work together to ensure that we pass a budget that will fund the government and get our federal workers back to work. #TrumpAddress #PresidentialAddress https://t.co/SxLBoLf3X7 The opioid epidemic. Gun violence. The dramatic rise in veteran suicide. These are the real crises in America that the President should be talking about. #PresidentialAddress 800,000 federal workers and countless of families in my district are suffering needlessly. Federal parks are being trashed. All so @realDonaldTrump could throw a temper tantrum. #PresidentialAddress No one has been more focused on fighting drug trafficking and public corruption in the Western Hemisphere than me. But almost all the cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine comes into this country from ports of entry, not through the desert. #PresidentialAddress FACT: @CBP stopped 6 immigrants listed is the terrorism database during the first half of 2018. We should all be concerned about terrorists entering our country, but that is no excuse for lies and exaggeration. #PresidentialAddress https://t.co/kIXUGBvEAx Families who are fleeing violence and poverty are turning themselves in and asking for asylum. We need more immigration judges, more medical personnel, and more staff at ports of entry, not a wall. #PresidentialAddress Let's get this straight: the number of people crossing the southern border is at historic lows. What we have is a humanitarian and administrative crisis‚Äîa pattern of premeditated malice‚Äîof the Trump Administration's own making. #PresidentialAddress https://t.co/IOyoXqLLGW RT @NPR: 'They Conveniently Forgot To Notify Us': EU Diplomat Downgraded In D.C. https://t.co/GMw4QAb2fX Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That‚Äôs not a pattern ‚Äì that‚Äôs an epidemic. Congress has to step up &amp; pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place. #NeverAgain https://t.co/TpguhT3D9D Tune in NOW for the first meeting of the @RulesDemocrats in the #116thCongress! We'll be discussing the need to pass clean funding bills to open the government and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/3xHURiFwxc Sintonic√© a @CNNDUSA @CNNEE a las 5pm ET/2pm PT. Estar√© hablando con @jclopezcnn sobre @CICIGgt y la alocuci√≥n nacional que dar√° @realDonaldTrump esta noche. The first full week of the 116th Congress gets underway today. I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to continue to be the voice of the people of California‚Äôs 35th District in Congress. Let‚Äôs get to work! https://t.co/ptR0qWq3iT Guatemala's Constitutional Court @CC_Guatemala has taken an important step in quickly taking up @CICIGgt case. As this process moves forward, the Government of Guatemala must respect the Court's independence. https://t.co/beEEDHongo Shameful. The Trump Administration is hiding its many crimes, including family separation and the death of children in @CBP custody, from international scrutiny. https://t.co/FYVYEHRqYp RT @RedCross: This #NationalBloodDonorMonth, we're celebrating those who #GiveMoreLife through vital blood &amp; platelet donations. Join them‚Ä¶ Congratulations, Governor @GavinNewsom! You stand on the shoulders of legislators who made hard decisions to dig California out from a $15b wall of debt to create a $30b surplus. May you build on our work to protect education, housing, &amp; public safety for future generations. https://t.co/kUzVLOpiZr Holding 800,000 federal workers hostage is bad enough. Now millions of our nation's most vulnerable and working poor families and children could be robbed of their food security.
 
Last week, I voted to end the #TrumpShutdown. @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump must do the same. https://t.co/xByBIFOIhp Faced with the prospect of criminal investigation, Guatemala‚Äôs president has chosen to destroy the rule of law in order to save himself.
