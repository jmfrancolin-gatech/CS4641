Democratic Congress: we're going to keep following the evidence until the truth comes out. I cannot wait to join my colleagues on @HouseJudiciary this morning to discuss tangible gun violence prevention legislation. It will be the committee's first hearing on the topic in years. Long overdue. Lots to do. Eager to get to it. There is a teleprompter president and a real president, and letting Trump be Trump has meant years of division and discord.

We will hold this administration accountable, and fight for equality, opportunity, and prosperity for all Americans. #SOTU

https://t.co/nyLBl4E15n Tomorrow I will join my colleagues in the House Judiciary Committee to hold the first hearing on gun violence in eight years. Eight years.

Our first goal: closing the background check loopholes.

Every gun purchase should have a background check. Will POTUS support it? #SOTU https://t.co/K3ljdCRXil RT @RepDonBeyer: The President talks about a major mass shooting, in Pittsburgh, but is silent about the problem of gun violence which clai… 11 killed at Tree of Life. 17 at Parkland. 49 at Pulse. 

The common factor is guns. No other country has mass shootings like ours.

I’m tired of moments of silence. Tired of speeches. Let’s DO SOMETHING.

We’re going to pass real reforms. Will the president support them? #SOTU Exactly. Every one of us supports ending HIV transmissions in America.  We can and should do this.

But the administration hasn’t made that goal a priority, in fact they’ve taken us backwards. Listen to @RepBarbaraLee, who has been leading on this issue for decades. https://t.co/vFc9aZbczv RT @MEPFuller: It's actually terrible that we live in a country where a kid would have to raise $40,000 to fund her cancer treatment. The president is talking about reducing the cost of healthcare while standing in front of the woman responsible for passing the Affordable Care Act—a law he has tried to dismantle. 

When it comes to reducing the cost of healthcare, I’ll take @SpeakerPelosi every time. #SOTU Real solutions are needed on the border—humane ones, worthy of a great country. Not tearing children from parents. Not a wall. #SOTU The wall is a public-relations ploy that would not improve our safety, be easy to circumvent, require tens of billions of dollars, damage our reputation and moral authority, and require stealing land from American landowners. It’s yet another scam. A wall is useless without people to guard it. Yet thousands of law enforcement officers were forced to work without pay during the shutdown.

The president shut down the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Coast Guard. Most drugs are smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry. Nearly 90% of the heroin, cocaine, meth, and fentanyl smuggled into the country comes through ports of entry (which are understaffed by the administration). According to the Washington Post, as of July 2017, the State Department said there was “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” The “caravans” discussed by the President are families presenting themselves for asylum (which they have the legal right to do) at ports of entry, not crossing the desert.

More undocumented people are leaving the United States than entering it. The President’s administration has chosen to not spend huge quantities of border security funding already allocated by Congress. There are thousands of officer vacancies at U.S. Ports of Entry. President Trump’s descriptions of the border have completely lost touch with reality. #SOTU

A thread: Congress has already passed bills to fund our government and secure our border. The president wanted a shutdown instead and he got one. I hope he learned his lesson from that mistake. Sorry Mr. President, the investigations into your administration and campaign are a measured and careful response to what may have been illegal activity. This is exactly what Congress is supposed to do: hold the executive branch accountable. #SOTU I’m glad to hear President Trump speak about the middle class but so far we’ve seen little but broken promises—rising healthcare costs, a tax break for the wealthy, and a shutdown that hurt working families. The American people need results, not more promises. #SOTU Nearly 100 years after women earned the right to vote, more than 100 women are serving in Congress. Tonight the @HouseDemWomen are wearing suffragette white to remind the president that we—and the rights our ancestors fought for—aren't going anywhere. #SOTU #SOTU2019 https://t.co/ZkFDdj5YxV Walking with my #SOTU guest Ralph Velez on a beautiful night outside of our nation’s Capitol.

I hope that Congress will pass this bill soon, and restore to us a government for the people, by the people. And so if we're serious about America being the greatest country in the world, then we all should play a role in making it easier for our citizens—regardless of their race, sexual orientation, gender—to exercise their basic right. The men and women who passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 didn't do so because there WASN'T a problem. And when we talk about "that was old" and "that's in the past"—no. That was in my lifetime. And it was in the lifetimes of several of the members of the Judiciary Committee. How long will we have to still—as we sit here in 2019—continue to have to defend a person's right to cast their vote? Let me remind you about black and brown people who simply wanted to exercise their right to vote. Many of them were the victims of hangings, beatings, burnings, bombings, dismemberments, disfigurements—all for wanting to exercise their basic right.
https://t.co/MVjCkD3BZ4 Thank you for your expert testimony @Sifill_LDF. https://t.co/2l6mgelJGC @30piecesofsilve Thank you, and thanks for the good question. PASSED. Final vote: 412 to 12.

We have a choice: #NeverAgain https://t.co/J1Q04ePYhw The Democratic Congress has already voted to extend immediately back-pay to everyone who was denied their paychecks. We must not put them in this position ever again. #ForThePeople This shutdown has proven that our country relies every day on the vital work of our federal employees. They keep our food and skies safe, prevent crime and terrorism, and provide life-and-death services upon which millions of Americans rely. Today’s deal is the short-term extension that Democrats have already passed, and that I have voted for. The Senate unanimously passed the same plan before the President changed his mind and rejected it, saying ‘I’m proud to shut down the government.’ The President just agreed to the same bipartisan deal he originally rejected when he shut down the government. Put simply, he caved. 

This whole reckless shutdown could have been avoided. Now we need to make sure that American families never have to go through this again.

My statement: https://t.co/JPNWiRSFQp https://t.co/INSnG70Gxl "Hold each other accountable regardless of party," he continued. "We deserve leaders that put our country before themselves, and stop the political chessmanship. I served in the @USCG for 30 years for the greater good of our country. Our leaders need to think of their duty." https://t.co/wlPedoihWG Jeff's advice to Congress the President: "America's veterans and public servants hold themselves to a high standard. Congress and the President should follow that example. Intentionally creating an image of national security weakness is never in our country’s best interest." Jeff points out that the @USCG stationed near Mar-a-Lago are working without pay to protect the Commander in Chief’s family. They report for duty, get underway, fly, patrol and put their lives at risk. It is an important mission, but they deserve to be treated fairly. His family is deeply anxious, but he also worries about friends and colleagues. "These are good people trying to do the right thing. If this goes on, it'll be a national security issue. Military and federal families can't do this for much longer." When he was active duty, he patrolled on cutters enforcing federal laws and treaties, performing search and rescue or conducting migrant interdiction —every time as a humanitarian but always helping others. https://t.co/m8c5CiVrEY They're collecting donations for others, even while struggling themselves, for the same reason Jeff joined the @USCG in the first place: he wanted to help people. "The anxiety and stress is crippling." Their mortgage, car, utilities payment are due soon and may not be paid. Jeff is also a @USCG retiree, and may not receive his military pension at the end of month which he uses to pay his mortgage &amp; support his special needs son in college. https://t.co/0Ja40B3d17 My constituent Jeff serves with the @USCG, and initiated a call to action on his social media to collect donations to help fellow furloughed federal families. But he himself is furloughed. "I don't think people can comprehend how stressful this has become," he said. https://t.co/oVq0YoEEZC Proud to be joining the Intelligence Committee. Thank you @RepAdamSchiff for your commitment to our national security, civil liberties, and constitution. Looking forward to the important work ahead. https://t.co/44UGNoSzna Some news:
https://t.co/87wrELSUbC RT @orlandosentinel: Kenya says all gunmen killed in hotel attack; 14 victims perish https://t.co/pHeBlPafzX https://t.co/zFAswHslbl @RichSantos Hi Rich, Democrats in Congress have already voted in support of so much border security funding that the Administration hasn't even spent it all. If he was actually serious about border security he would fill the 2,100 vacancies for officers at our ports of entry. "The economy could easily stall in the first quarter" due to the shutdown.

@HouseDemocrats have voted 7 times to re-open the government. It's time for the Senate GOP to re-pass the bipartisan funding they passed last year, and for Trump to sign it.
https://t.co/JXQHkRIVBI The blight of white supremacy on our great country has tainted our history, taken the lives of our loved ones, and threatens our future. It is, as Dr. King said, a 'thing that matters.' We will not be silent. Not today, not ever.
 
Happy birthday to a true King. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., born 90 years ago today, said that "our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." Today the House voted to formally condemn white nationalism and its resident defender, Steve King. Today is Dr. King's birthday. He called on all of us to "enlist in a crusade finally to make the race question an ugly relic of a dark past." If we are great nation, we all must exercise our power, and take a stand so strong that even the white supremacists can't ignore it. https://t.co/bqXfx0busW RT @RepTimRyan: Number of times the House voted to reopen the government: 6

Number of times the Senate voted to reopen the government: 0… Working families are hurting. It’s vital that we reopen the government and get it back to work #ForThePeople. https://t.co/Lq9tyNpteQ The community has provided help, but it's not enough. Money is running out, and they're starting to worry about what comes next. Hundreds of thousands of families are in the same situation as Ralph's. They all deserve better. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/ve9Njyw4pQ Ralph told my office that their family is triaging bills, delaying whatever they can to protect the essentials – food, water, light. He's reached out to their mortgage company and other creditors to try to ask for delays until he's paid again, but so far everyone has said no. https://t.co/trPHS5K7Gz Ralph is an 11-year @USArmy vet who has spent 5 years keeping us safe at @MCO. Now, because of the #TrumpShutdown, he’s working without pay. They have a son in the 4th grade, one in college, and one with special needs. His family is struggling to make ends meet. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/iegLWhMeO5 Confused about the government shutdown? That's ok! Here are the facts: House Democrats have voted seven times and counting to reopen the government and make sure it works #ForThePeople.

Let's review the timeline of the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/DTuagJgijv The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government. The Senate previously passed bipartisan funding legislation but now @SenateGOP refuses. The problem is Trump. This shutdown is having a real impact on working families, like Brandon's. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/DNH8DiiH8o Here's Doug's message to President Trump and to Congress: "these are safety-related positions, and the added stress has a real impact. Please find a resolution soon. My family is counting on it." https://t.co/jt30if9fl2 Their daughter is going to college soon. They want to throw an 18th birthday party this month, but finances are shaky. If the shutdown drags on and the local training facility remains closed, Doug might be forced to travel for work, forcing him to miss her high school graduation. Doug's mother has schizophrenia, and he helps take care of her. They've also got the same expenses as millions of other families - a mortgage, car payments, and the daily expenses that pile up all too quickly. https://t.co/pgUUCdURxN Doug keeps over 300 pieces of sensitive equipment operational for @MCO, including the auto-pilot landing systems. He's no stranger to stress after five years in the @USMC, but the #TrumpShutdown means he's working without a paycheck, "adding to the stress of an stressful job." https://t.co/78Ack3R8q1 Thank you to the organizers of the Martin Luther King Commission Interfaith Multicultural Celebration for an inspiring evening. Our greatest domestic challenge today is hate. The best weapon we have to overcome that hate is love. I believe that love triumphs over hate. We all have a responsibility to speak out against injustices in society, especially during the critical time that we are in right now. https://t.co/RIgYEPhqSB "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that." - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. https://t.co/62VnpIV3Ra RT @Bgbdee: #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/wadZUDSje1
