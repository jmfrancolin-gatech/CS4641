I am proud to support the @seedspot family in Phoenix + Washington. Congrats on your success in both cities. Your entrepreneurs continue to inspire. #yesPHX https://t.co/dJfUJBxshm RIP to one of the best Congressman in our history, John Dingell. Heaven just got one funniest people in politics. Prayers to his wife, @DebDingell, and family. https://t.co/BmNx1kOlp8 Honored to greet the new Ambassador from India to the US, @HarshShringla. US/India is an essential bilateral relationship. https://t.co/7GOVmaGknC Today’s Judiciary Committee topic: “Preventing Gun Violence: A Call to Action.” First gun safety hearing in Congress in 10 years. Overflow crowd of @AMarch4OurLives young leaders. Thinking of @JenLongdon as I hear the powerful testimony. https://t.co/5t5ZXM2T11 Thank you,@EllePerezPerez, for joining as my guest at #SOTU. Your strength and grit inspire me. I will work for you and all DREAMERers until real immigration reform is a reality. https://t.co/n9nWctwF1e Congrats to my friend @mayorgiles on this morning’s State of the City Address. Your leadership is driving Mesa’s positive growth. And congrats to @MesaDistrict4 (Jen Duff) &amp; @MesaDistrict3 (Francisco Heredia) for chairing Mesa Achieve 60 education initiative. Best wishes to our Chinese community and all those celebrating #LunarNewYear. May the Year of the Pig be filled with luck and prosperity! 
新年快乐 RT @TCHArizona: We were excited and honored to have @gregstantonaz visit us today. Thanks for taking the time to learn about abilities and… Great video. Go Devils! #blackhistorymonth #futurelooksbright https://t.co/oJ824e750R On this day in 1870, the 15th Amendment was ratified, granting African American men the right to vote. However, it has also taken the 19th Amendment and women’s suffrage, the Voting Rights Act, and the soon-to-be-passed #HR1 to better fulfill its promise. #BlackHistoryMonth It’s time to take action against gun violence. On Wed the House Judiciary Committee holds the 1st hearing on gun violence prevention in a decade. Thurs we will vote yes on HR8- Universal Background Checks. We will honor the work of @GabbyGiffords, @lucymcbath and so many others. This is a great bipartisan victory for Arizona and a recognition that climate change is already taking a real toll. So many in our state worked to get this done, and I’ll work to make sure Congress does its part and authorizes these landmark agreements. https://t.co/Lxbb9VoRHO How is @DevinBook not playing in @NBAAllStar? Averages 25 points &amp; 7 assists per game. Lots of great players this year, but our guy deserves a spot. Investing in early childhood education provides the best long term ROI. I’ll always support Head Start! https://t.co/YXS1UqBuwL The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law 10 years ago today, but there is still work to do. I’m proud to continue the fight for equal pay as a co-sponsor of the #PaycheckFairness Act, which will be reintroduced tomorrow. It’s time to get this done and close the wage gap. First public hearing of House Judiciary Commitee concerns HR1 (I’m a cosponsor). The bill helps restore confidence in our democracy through banning dark money, restoring Voting Rights Act, strengthing lobbyist disclosure, requires nonpartisan redistricting, and much more. https://t.co/1w9wIWR9an On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we pause to remember more than six million innocent Jewish lives stolen. The past taught us: When we see hate, don’t look the other way. Together we must challenge, fight and eliminate prejudice. #NeverAgain Great to be home celebrating the 70th #RepublicDay2019 with our friends in the Indo-American community. https://t.co/nulPVgIm6a Each year, 2 million Arizonans struggle to access adequate food. When our federal workers go without pay for 34 days and counting, the effects are real and immediate. Thanks to volunteers from Trevor Browne H.S. and St. Mary's CEO Tom Kertis for prepping meals for local families. https://t.co/EiUwCUdWhY The longer the shutdown goes on, the more it hurts families in our community. Last week, @StMarysFoodBank in Phoenix packed and distributed 100,000+ lbs of food and expects to do the same this week—ensuring federal workers and their families have access to healthy meals. https://t.co/b8H9lbyfqD RT @changinghands: Yesterday we hosted @RepGregStanton for a discussion with federal workers about the impacts of the Trump shutdown. Arizo… @BenMcAdams and I bring a mayor’s mentality to Congress: Just get good things done for the people we represent. Our residents deserve strong results, less rhetoric. https://t.co/SZ7P1fwJcF The public servants I met with yesterday- air traffic controllers, TSA agents, forest management officials- are committed to our safety, despite working 5 weeks without pay. For them, their families and their service, it’s time to #endtheshutdown now. https://t.co/vuyO8sfnaG One of the best things I did as Phoenix mayor was push for a human rights ordinance. My thoughts on today’s Arizona Supreme Court hearing: https://t.co/bnOCZ9ljgH A perfect day in Phoenix for a march to honor Dr. King. Great to welcome to Pilgrim’s Rest Pastor Terry Mackey and his wife, Lynn, and beautiful children to our community. #MLKJrDay https://t.co/8V4gYmGPHV Today marks one year since the passing of Bishop Alexis Thomas of Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church. Our community misses his deep wisdom, compassionate heart and infectious laugh. #OneOfaKind https://t.co/FsJcmPEpkK I can’t wait to get started on the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee. Our country can’t compete successfully without much stronger infrastructure investments: public transportation, roads, aviation, water, technology + more. https://t.co/RkeIejR3Np I’m very excited about this assignment to serve on the House Judiciary Committee and ready to get right to work to help solve important, challenging issues. https://t.co/3MOlQdYUJR A significant census undercount would likely cost AZ hundreds of millions of dollars in federal support—taxes our residents would pay and not get back. It’s essential that we stand strong in a bipartisan way to do what’s best for our state. As mayor, I made sure Phoenix took a stand on the census—and it was the right thing to do. The Administration's blatant attempt to play politics with the census and intimidate minority communities from being counted has been rightfully blocked at a court of law. https://t.co/zXYhRtxbpx Meet Desmond. He’s been my “little”brother for 24 years through @bbbsaz. His mom, Carolyn, has been a public servant at Bureau of Land Management for 40 years. Furloughed for 4 weeks now, she’s set up a GoFundMe just to pay for her basic necessities. #heartbroken #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/S4y7bHvTLz @jwlewis4262 Sending you some positive prayers. Last week in Congress, most of the attention was on our work passing key bills to reopen our government. A little lost in the shuffle: We also voted to enter the fight to protect the Affordable Care Act in the ongoing Texas legal case. Previously, Congress was on the sidelines. A nice gesture from one of #AZ09's great companies, Fox Restaurant Concepts: Flower Child in Rockville, MD is offering a free, healthy meal daily from 2-5pm to federal employees hurt by the #shutdown. But our businesses shouldn't have to step up like this. #openthegovernmentnow Great work by Mayor @theldawilliams and City Council on delivering an important water infrastructure investment win to Phoenix residents. This will help to secure our water future and shows real local leadership. Today’s a special day... the House of Reps Cloakroom will forever be named for @GabbyGiffords and the late Rep. Leo Ryan. And we honor her courage and tenacity even more by passing #HR8, universal background checks. https://t.co/Bi4KgWWTcW RT @GiffordsCourage: The House held a moment of silence tonight honoring victims of the Tucson shooting, including @GabbyGiffords.

Completion of the new 15-gate concourse is a milestone in a critical infrastructure upgrade to our region’s largest economic engine. A big day for @PHXSkyHarbor: In addition to the T3 South Concourse modernization, new signs for the terminal’s namesake Sen. John McCain will make our tribute visible to the world. In Dec. 2017, the City Council unanimously supported the designation—I wish he could see it today. @ChadHGriffin, @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenTinaSmith, @RepStephMurphy, @RepShalala, @RepMarkTakano — proud to stand with such a strong group of advocates. Thanks to @HRC for bringing together so many pro-equality members at last night’s #EqualityWins reception. Chad and his team absolutely killed it in 70+ races across 23 states—and we certainly felt their power in Arizona. Looking forward to the work we’re going to do together. https://t.co/5MO3oHIxUh A few fun, light hearted moments from our first day in Congress before getting down to serious business. https://t.co/7UoAEqy68f (2/2) Today, I’m flying to Washington with my 3rd grade daughter to my swearing in as a US Congressman. We’ve got some challenges, but ours is a great country. #AZ09 https://t.co/XundM00x4e (1/2) In 1978, I was in 3rd grade &amp; my parents took our family on a summer vacation to the nation’s capitol to learn about our government. We couldn’t afford airplane tickets, so we traveled cross country from Phoenix by Trailways bus- 3 days &amp; 2 nights (each way). We loved it. Trump’s latest threat poses a serious risk to our economy and jobs. Arizona-Mexico trade supports more than 100,000 private sector jobs, and 30% of our state’s exports are to Mexico. Playing politics with people’s jobs is dangerous and wrong. https://t.co/H3UnZ1AB0C Celebrated 10 years of light rail today! It has exceeded expectations, but our best days are still ahead. The future of public transportation in our region is brighter and more important than ever. https://t.co/x28v8DflLU RT @valleymetro: "Nothing has brought the Valley cities closer together than light rail." @gregstantonaz @valleymetro https://t.co/Vdjjcn0P… Our Phoenix Non Discrimination Ordinance makes clear we will not tolerate disparate treatment of our LGBTQ residents.

Here’s to more progress in 2019! https://t.co/v0RSPfkyhh A government shutdown now would be an unprecedented failure of leadership and a complete abdication of responsibility - all for what will only be symbolic funding that will do nothing to make our border more secure. And who pays the price? The hardworking American people. Enough. So saddened to hear about the passing of Chief Justice Charles Jones. He was a great jurist and an honorable man, and he had a tremendous impact on @NicoleStantonAZ’s life.

She said Ed was loved by all members of Congress, and he won friends (and votes) with “cigars and tequila.” He will be missed greatly in Arizona and Washington. https://t.co/9KZfm3d7I4 Today was the funeral mass for one of our greatest Arizonans, Congressman Ed Pastor. His leadership helped millions, but his greatest legacy was mentorship. Generations of Arizona leaders have been guided by his wisdom, gentle touch and good humor.
