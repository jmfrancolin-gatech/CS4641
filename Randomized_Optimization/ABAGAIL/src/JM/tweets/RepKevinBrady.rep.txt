- Wages up 3.2% from year ago - best year/year increase in a decade. 
- U.S. economy remains strong. #GOPTaxCuts https://t.co/KCnc6X8NHv GENTLE REMINDER - 2 weeks ago GOP House passed bill to fully fund gov't, build wall &amp; $8.7 billion in crucial disaster aid for CA wildfires, hurricanes/severe storms. Yesterday's "show vote" accomplished nothing, helped no one.     
#WorkTogether   https://t.co/rSwX7j6zIF Our GOP amendment stripped this funding, but was rejected. Whether pro-abortion or strongly pro-life - as I am - should U.S. taxpayers fund abortions in foreign countries?

Thanks, friend, for a lifetime of principled, conservative service to Houston, America and your beloved Texas. And that's just the way it is..... https://t.co/x3r6UMddEc UPDATE: Democrat Majority pushes through new anti-accountability Rules for the 116th Congress.  Makes raising taxes easier. Public can be blocked from knowing how their Representative voted to raise taxes or raise the national debt limit. #MoreTaxesMoreDebtMoreSecrecy https://t.co/avhMtVqfL1 RT @WaysandMeansGOP: Rough start for Dem majority –&gt; 230 @HouseDemocrats voted to reject a proposal to make important tax deductions for mi… Hmmm...who's the "Party-of-the-Rich"? House #Dems defeat 231-197 middle-class tax relief that permanently doubles child tax credit &amp; standard deduction. 

On same day introduces bill to give $140,000+ year tax break to millionaires. 
#HopeVotersWontNotice https://t.co/k9cbiqDm6r On the House floor. Offering amendment to Dem House rules - my amendment will make permanent the doubled child tax credit and the doubled standard deduction from the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act.  Big 4 working families &amp; middle class! #Vote4Workers Everyone knows that our border is not secure. Houston is a hot bed for sex trafficking, for violent gangs, for drug trafficking, much of it from the southern border. We know there are real consequences to not having a secure border. https://t.co/HCzYNpYIAd Proud to cast my vote for Speaker for my friend and GOP nominee #kevinmccarthy. https://t.co/ngocD7scPt This analysis by the respected Douglas Holtz-Eakin @AAF  proves the new tax law has driven investment in the U.S., higher wages and higher growth. 
https://t.co/pEd1xr2fn2 The new House Rules proposed by Democrats today: 
- Keeps secret your Reps vote to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.
- Keeps secret your Reps vote to increase taxes on yr family &amp; biz. 
QUESTION: This the 'open, accountable government' you deserve?
#MoreTaxesMoreDebtMoreSecrecy https://t.co/2rkpRlBMX5 Up and at’em. Honored to be sworn in today for another term representing the Great 8th District of Texas.  Will keep fighting for lower taxes, stronger military and greater opportunities for families and our children. Thank you. #HonoredBlessed https://t.co/Hp2vXGj6al Ready to talk about a New Year, a new Congress with Shara Fryer and Bob Frantz on @ktrhnews Tune in now! On @AM1070TheAnswer with @SamMaloneShow Tune in! Hard to find common ground if you won’t listen. 

Houston region is a hotbed for sex trafficking, violent gangs &amp; drug trafficking. All from southern border. We know border is not secure &amp; innocent lives are hurt because of it.

https://t.co/gXQguEx7TT Wow - you should read House Democrats new rules they’ll rush through tomorrow. No required recorded vote for tax increases on families &amp; local businesses. No recorded vote on raising U.S. debt ceiling. No accountability of Congress. Just #MoreTaxesMoreDebtMoreSecrecy https://t.co/jXFoUUnKaV Following the successful and historic rewrite of our federal tax code, the technical corrections process ensures that the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is consistent with Congressional intent. Click below for my full statement and to read the draft. https://t.co/UDtA6KFJXH What an amazing year - really an amazing #65YearsInService - for the @Springfdtx Our #TX08 families and businesses are safer because of the bravery, hard work and commitment of these heroes. https://t.co/dICPzEHawX Proposed Democratic House rules repeal clause XXI, subsection 5(b) that requires 3/5 vote for income tax hikes - and require automatic recorded vote to ensure public knows how each Representative voted. https://t.co/0DVw58YoRe Tomorrow House Democrats set stage for tax increases. New rules make it easier to raise income taxes, and do it without even a recorded vote by lawmakers. They don’t even protect poor or middle class families.

Welcome to a New Year! https://t.co/J26fZfmLjb This isn’t very encouraging. Fact: If Democrats sincerely want to govern to help America they’ll have to work with GOP.  If they want partisan political games, they’ll do this. #WhyNotWorkTogether 
https://t.co/4MAuoxbeVe Reminder: In June every House Democrat voted against compromise bill that funded the border wall in return for legal status for Dreamers &amp; keeping asylum families together during judicial process. Proof @Democrats want political issue, not a solution. #2Extreme https://t.co/vunhNG02zg RT @HoustonTexans: AFC SOUTH CHAMPIONS‼️

#WeAreTexans https://t.co/lUtGFnT7df Texas mourns the passing of Richard Overton, who was a proud Texan and the nation's oldest WWII veteran. Our thoughts and prayers are with Richard's family at this time, may God bless him and watch over them. Thank you for your service, Richard. https://t.co/y0xhpCFGiR Agree, Sen. Hatch. Religious bigotry has no place in U.S. ...including the Senate. #Shameful https://t.co/ivWJN5wid8 This shutdown unnecessary. House has sent common-sense solution to Senate. Main roadblock: #NancyPelosi CAN’T budge - her extreme members will pull their votes for Speaker.  Preview of #Dem dysfunctional majority? https://t.co/BgicqaXQek Missing facts: 
1) New tax law INCREASES % of $$ contributions deductible, 
2) With xtra $2k, more jobs &amp; higher wages, families can give more, 
3) Stronger economy = more contributions. 2008 fell 2%, 2009 fell 3.7%, took 5 yrs to recover to ‘07 levels. https://t.co/DGk9hNjVP1 If this is not a national day, it should be! Thank you, Cathy, for a wonderful Christmas for the Brady’s, the Patronella’s and the Gieknapp’s (who traveled from Iowa for a Texas Christmas complete with Christmas Eve bbq). https://t.co/n1Q7kvtKKP I’m sure Ray’s family appreciates your kind note.
