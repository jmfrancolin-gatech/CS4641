Throughout this process however, I've had serious concerns that the Trump Administration lacks a coherent strategy to address the threat new Russian cruise missiles pose to the interests of the United States and those of our allies. The Russian Federation brazenly violated the INF treaty &amp; has been unwilling to take the steps necessary to come back into compliance. The Kremlin bears responsibility for the degradation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

https://t.co/rY5moni8zM Today‚Äôs the day workers miss their 2nd paychecks. Today‚Äôs also the day that @senatemajldr can tell POTUS that it's time to end this.

Open the government, release the hostages and then we‚Äôll negotiate.

This shutdown has to end now. Stop holding our air traffic controllers‚Äîincluding @EWRairport and @PHLAirport‚Äîhostage and open the government. https://t.co/oDoBFk0Su7 Only in Donald Trump‚Äôs parallel alternate universe has ISIS been defeated.

And then we should come together to figure out how we're going to govern this co‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also great to hear about hospitals across New Jersey working with patients impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. Thanks to @HorizonBCBSNJ @RWJBarnabas  @RUStudentHealth  @HolyNameMedCtr @CooperHospital @NewBridgeMedCtr @sjh_nj &amp; more! Thanks to @RutgersU for stepping up to help govt workers &amp; their families. @tesu_edu also deferred tuition for over 130 active duty @USCG members facing major disruptions to their education. I hope others follow their lead to ensure the #TrumpShutdown has no impact on education. https://t.co/WqngyaJ1ua Clean bill to reopen the government got more votes than Trump‚Äôs‚Äîin a Senate with a Republican majority.

Mr. President, do you see the writing on the ‚Äúwall‚Äù yet? We can negotiate border security AFTER you give your GOP followers permission to act responsibly and #EndTheShutdown. Workers don't have paychecks. They might miss payments on mortgages, student loans, car loans, &amp; credit cards. @BrianSchatz &amp; I have a message for financial institutions: Please, do EVERYTHING you can to work w/ customers affected by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/KAZ15zUXec It‚Äôs no secret which one I‚Äôm choosing‚Äîoption 2, the bipartisan legislation.

Is @SenateGOP finally going to stand up to Trump and #EndTheShutdown?

We‚Äôre waiting‚Ä¶‚åö We‚Äôre voting on 2 bills to end the #TrumpShutdown today:
1) Trump‚Äôs worse-than-advertised proposal that is just another hostage-taking attempt for his border wall
2) Bipartisan House-passed legislation to reopen the govt that @SenateMajLdr &amp; GOP supported last year How low can you go? When it comes to bending over backwards to protect the worst polluters, it‚Äôs clear the Trump Admin can go LOW. @WashingtonPost is reporting that @EPA penalties for polluting are down 85%!

https://t.co/mpuk5JozzI President Trump might be ignoring the workers impacted by the #TrumpShutdown, but I‚Äôm not. Here are some $0.00 paystubs from NJ‚Äôs air traffic controllers. üëÄ

It's time to stop playing games‚ÄîTrump needs to open the government and pay our workers. https://t.co/qqRrtV61UG Workers shouldn‚Äôt have to decide between paying for gas to get to work and putting food on the table to feed their families. Even after 22 years, this is the worst shutdown Rod has ever seen.

Mr. President, don‚Äôt hold Rod hostage over YOUR campaign promise. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/0oqYwmoxvL ‚ÄúFriday may not be the 13th, but for some federal workers it‚Äôs shaping up to be a frightening day: the 2nd bi-weekly paycheck they won't be getting since the partial government shutdown began December 22.‚Äú

Trump, it's time to ditch your 34 day temper tantrum of a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/qwwIWextr4 Getting unwanted phone calls? Scammers harassing you for money? Well, thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, the officials at the FTC in charge of enforcing the Do Not Call List are not working.

Thanks, Trump. #EndTheShutdown

Congratulations to Coach Delcalzo from Hasbrouck Heights on his nomination for the Don Shula @NFL High School Coach of the Year Award. We‚Äôll be rooting for you, Coach! üèà By erratically pulling US troops out of Syria, the Trump Admin will abandon the Kurds, our closest allies in this fight.

Stop hurting hardworking Americans. The decision by SCOTUS to lift the lower court stay on the transgender ban in the military is a heartbreaking development. This hateful policy implemented by Donald Trump is a stain on our history and a reminder of why elections mater.
