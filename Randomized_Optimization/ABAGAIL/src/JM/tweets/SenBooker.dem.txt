Happy Lunar New Year to all who celebrate. Wishing you and your family a year of great happiness and prosperity! Proud that today New Jersey signed a bill to raise the state's minimum wage to $15/hr. It’s time we do that on the federal level for ALL workers! #FightFor15 https://t.co/XLCh4zYjER A young man once wrote to Rosa Parks: "I wonder, will there ever be a time when all people will be treated equally? I believe that we as a people and the world are divided. I am fearful."

Amen.
https://t.co/FITPtzSvUd https://t.co/Cw4uA846BK Finally – looks like President Trump is agreeing to #EndTheShutdown. It's infuriating that he put 800,000 American workers through over a month of hell for no good reason.
