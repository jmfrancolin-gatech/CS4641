Nadia Murad was my honored guest at the State of the Union. Though she was in DC to raise awareness of the #Yazidi genocide, she gently and profoundly articulated the need to respect human dignity, using the pain in her soul to help heal our broken world. https://t.co/fv5VOKWcMU Important discussion today with the Nebraska Education Association on safety in schools. https://t.co/qnDC9nlsnM Meaningful evening with Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad. #SOTU2019 https://t.co/rkQcUWGhWL So honored to see Maunka Morgan and students of the Little Priest Tribal College.

We all have equal places in the universe.” Thank you to our tribal members for enriching the state of Nebraska with your timeless wisdom. https://t.co/8Wnq3PbOJ3 Nadia endured unspeakable horrors as a prisoner of ISIS.

I appreciate your support for the Yazidi community.… On the wings of the OC-135B replacement, USSSTRATCOM’s new headquarters and now the decision to replace the Offutt runway, those who serve our nation from Offutt Air Force Base will have the facilities, equipment and infrastructure to keep our country safe https://t.co/0dE1TF5th0 Nobel Prize Winner Nadia Murad will be my guest at the State of the Union. Her heartbreaking story of enslavement by ISIS, courageous escape, and ongoing fight for basic human rights for her #Yazidi people is a story the world needs to hear @realDonaldTrump @NadiaMuradBasee #SOTU The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has been an important pillar of global stability for three decades, but the U.S. cannot bind itself to a treaty when the other party is in clear violation. However, let’s not stop trying, let’s not let a new arms race begin. #INF So nice to see my friends Chris, Shane, and Eileen who came to DC to discuss legislative issues affecting the blind.

Daily proceedings in Congress start with what is called a Rule. Yesterday, I appeared amid debates on the shutdown and urged Members to open the government and secure the border. The President has provided a reasonable starting point for negotiations https://t.co/mxrUTHiRVw The media doesn’t ride the wave of tribalism, it creates it. @FrankBruni @nytimes #CovingtonBoys To effectively tackle work before us, Members of Congress are assigned to committees &amp; subcommittees. This allows a closer look at bills before they reach the floor for a vote. I currently serve as Ranking Member of the House Ag Appropriations Subcommittee https://t.co/dWkfKlnH04 A lot of legislation critical to Nebraska was passed by Congress and signed into law in 2018.

Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”—Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. #MLKDay Good deal, Mr. President, let’s go! @realdonaldtrump This week, I was named the Ranking Member of the House Ag Appropriations Subcommittee. To lead in this innovative space, I look to the Nebraska farm community as a model for how to grow our American farm family. https://t.co/TmlpYrJyQY So great to be with nearly 250 young people from schools across Nebraska who came to DC for the March for Life. #MarchForLife2019 https://t.co/PNPAjGj6XC I’m grateful to be named Republican Leader of the House Ag Appropriations Subcommittee. As I was considered for this position, I recalled a time when I was a boy. My grandfather, a county agent, asked me what I wanted to do with my life: I said, 'Papa, I want to be a farmer.’ We ought to rise above the momentary difficulty to find the mutually compatible goals of an operational government and safety for America. What I cannot accept, however, is that the House simply pass the Senate's bills without any negotiated process. https://t.co/FDC0WNGYrd .@SecPompeo, I appreciated your remarks at the American University in Cairo this week about America’s reinvigorated role in the Middle East. As you rightly noted, the U.S. is a liberating force in the region, not an occupying or dominating one https://t.co/r68YP7lBdk @AUC Every two years in America, we experience something almost miraculous in the history of the world: the safe, civil, and dignified transfer of power.

Thank you for the privilege to represent you in Congress. https://t.co/dWkfKlnH04 Good News! This past month, the US economy nearly doubled the number of jobs that economists predicted, with wages outpacing inflation. I just took the oath office. The oath is more than formality: It is the measure of the fullness of intent, of commitment, of duty. It is larger than any one of us; it is about upholding that which is timeless. #swearinginday No one wins in a shutdown; no one wins if the border is not safe. https://t.co/nvOk0Jqp3C This time of year, we pause as Nebraskans, as Americans, to celebrate the origins of an ancient faith tradition and its enduring spiritual beauty: the idea of family, the idea of giving, the idea of #Christmas https://t.co/nQKZoPI326 The House will soon attempt a bill that helps hurricane victims and adds border security.  If it passes, then it is back to the Senate to avoid a shutdown. Thank you Speaker Ryan for your calm, steady navigation of “The People’s House.” You did not seek this position, but you managed it with strength and decorum. We deeply appreciate your humble service to our country. @SpeakerRyan For Nebraskans, the Farm Bill is not just another bill out of Washington.  Like the rhythms of planting and sowing, it is an expected rite of legislative passage essential to who we are as a people. https://t.co/YKXpyBq7P1 I had a very extraordinary engagement this week with Professor Jordan Peterson.

His passion for the institution he lead for 28 years, his scholarly nature and gentlemanly demeanor were a tremendous inspiration to me. I so admired him. May he rest in peace. I wish you a blessed, happy Thanksgiving with your family. As I was thinking about this Fort Report, I thought it would be nice to list some of the good trends happening in our world.

Long way to go but, this is a positive step forward toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula. #NorthKorea I am honored to represent 40,141 veterans and over 5,000 active-duty military personnel. We are working hard to ensure our service members get the pay they deserve, effective and timely VA care, and functional equipment. #vets Hawley Hamlet, a neighborhood garden in Lincoln is on the leading edge of community agriculture. Tim brought in these NE potatoes organically grown in the City right-of-way! #Lincoln #ag https://t.co/l3Ylk09kvF Always great to see FFA leaders. Marie just told me about her family’s farm website. Check it out here: https://t.co/D6wyMIG78p @NebraskaFFA https://t.co/LkGfPcOtf0 Last night, the House passed the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act, which I cosponsored. The bill improves training of health professionals in palliative care and establishes traineeships for individuals preparing for advanced education in palliative care. The House will be considering a number of bills today to bolster nurse education, eliminate taxes on medical devices, and improve our veterans health care. #healthcare Dr. Mark Logan, a science fellow in my office, has spent the last few weekends repairing over 25 fractured diamond-backed turtle shells. 22 patients were saved and released back into the wild. Thank you for your conservation work! #conservation https://t.co/Jy0BqAsEBp In 2016, 120 Nebraskans died from an opioid overdose. In order to combat this crisis, Congress provided $4 million in funding to Nebraska for prevention, treatment, and rehab services. #opioids Lt Gov Mike Foley and Councilwoman Cyndi Lamm: great to see you at the Cornhusker State Games https://t.co/NoagyWhjAa Great to be at the opening of the Cornhusker State Games!  All the best to all the athletes! https://t.co/gx9oNzu5r9 “Ugh, don’t post that. It’s so embarrassing.” https://t.co/NvWopIizK4 "American Pickers" is in Nebraska this week. Tried my best, but I got picked over. @americanpickers #AmericanPickers This week’s events in Helsinki had a certain grayness. Even with the tsunami of analysis dominating this week’s news, key issues have been commingled that need to be unpacked. https://t.co/NISI4YdW8K More and more Americans are finding meaningful, and dutiful, work. The number of jobless claims are at their lowest level since 1969. https://t.co/zePqNx7wKD #Jobs The Nebraska Public Power District estimates that in the next five years 35-40% of Nebraska’s energy will come from wind. @NPPDnews Always fun to see Nebraskan families during their Washington vacations! #Nebraska https://t.co/j0tDTE4HsU Global connection in my Washington office: Ambassador Dina Kawar of Jordan showed Susan Littlefield of Rural Radio Network and me the world’s oldest bread. It was found after 14,400 years in ancient fireplace in Jordan. @AmbKawar @firefighter89 https://t.co/17aOwJGRH0 Good to meet with leaders of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Good discussion on ways to improve agricultural development while reducing aid dependency. #Ag So far this week, the House has passed several bills aimed at improving the readiness and modernization of the Navy and Marines and ending funding uncertainty for the Department of Defense. #Defense Great to meet with the Nebraska Farm Bureau and Young Farmers and Ranchers! Thanks for your valuable input on ways this year’s Farm Bill can best impact our ag family. #Ag https://t.co/B9m8BcwN0U Civility is necessary for productive discourse.  I do not tolerate vulgar or profane language on my social media accounts, regardless of the philosophical opinions of the commentator. #Civility The House is voting on a legislative package of over 30 bills that would improve the ability of businesses and investors to raise capital, as well as support startups, venture capital, and crowdfunding. #Startups Met with RESULTS in Washington this morning. I appreciate our honest discussion on ways we can support health initiatives around the globe. #Health https://t.co/os88G80UZH I spoke before the House of Representatives on my bill, the DELTA Act, a creative approach to conservation. https://t.co/kUS97mYGHz Great to see Shams, a young woman from Lincoln who has family in Iraq. We exchanged stories of our time in the region and what can be done to help those being persecuted. https://t.co/8U5q3gH0nE The House is voting to fund next year’s Interior, Environment, Financial Services, and General Government Appropriations Bill. Important programs funded include the National Park Service, National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Members of the House and Senate will soon meet to finalize the 2018 Farm Bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure my bill, the Rural Health Insurance Act, and amendments to the Farmer to Farmer Program are included in the final legislation. #FarmBill The US-Russia relationship faces many challenges. The complexities surrounding nuclear arms control, cyber security, and international terrorism are too serious to be sidelined even after the clear case of Russia election meddling. https://t.co/TNkHX3xyfy #TrumpPutinSummit Today the House will vote on a measure to ensure disabled veterans who are newly employed by the Federal government will receive appropriate leave for medical treatment. #Veterans On the whole, we have improving economic news of late. The jobless rate and hidden jobless rate are falling, and there is upward pressure on wages. This is welcomed relief from recent times where the story of America’s economic recovery has been uneven. https://t.co/Yo2atfpJMT Challenging Europe to do more for the NATO alliance is only fair. Europeans have advanced economies and capability. You cannot ask young Americans to defend you if you will not fight for yourself.  @POTUS Interested in attending a U.S. Service Academy?
