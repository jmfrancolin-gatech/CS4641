But at this time, these heroes are not eligible for full military honors ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.

Any discussion about border security must be coupled with immigration reform that takes into account the option for our Dreamers, farmworkers, and recipients of TPS to earn their citizenship. However, such serious discussions take time, especially if done in a bipartisan manner I strongly believe in bolstering the security on our borders, not with solutions from the 4th century, but with technology and infrastructure from the 21st century. This week, Congress will vote on and pass legislation that will reopen Treasury and IRS, USDA, EPA and DOI. Last week, Congress passed two bills to reopen government services, ensure workers get the paychecks they have earned, and restore certainty to the lives of the American people.  The bills also included provisions to provide back pay to federal employees. Despite the President proudly prolonging the partial government shut down, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to reopen our government. The ripple effect from this shut down will be felt far and beyond the people who rely on the federal government for employment and benefits, but also will be felt by every day Americans as some basic government services are stopped. Nearly 800,000 federal workers, including 39,000 in California, have been furloughed and may soon not get paychecks.  Money for food stamps and federal housing may soon dry up. .@realDonaldTrump’s decision to single handedly shut down a significant part of our government in order to fulfill a campaign promise by building an expensive and ineffective wall at our southern border is irresponsible, unprincipled, and is actually hurting Americans. Tonight, President Donald Trump again made it clear how proud he is to put his petulance and politics over legitimate policy and the lives of the American people.

Despite the President's rejection of those proposals and his call for this shutdown, Democrats will continue to work with Republicans to come to an agreement to reopen our government. Decisively, Congressional Democrats offered multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which included funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, not an ineffective and expensive wall. Disappointingly, the federal government has partially shut down as of this morning.  Disturbingly, President Donald Trump called for this shutdown more than 25 times and now has gotten what he wanted. Complete withdrawal from Syria. Major drawdown in Afghanistan. Is Korea next? President Trump, what is the strategy? Conducting national security policy without consultation, agreement, buy in, or intent is a danger and damaging to our values.
