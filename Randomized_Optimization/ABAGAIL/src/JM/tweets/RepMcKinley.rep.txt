It was an honor to address NETL Science Bowl this morning in Morgantown. https://t.co/YcniqbTKZG RT @SenateGOP: The radical #GreenNewDeal is a massive plan for the government to takeover and micromanage much of American life.
 
American… Fascinating read from the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board this week. "West Virginia’s revival started in early 2017 as coal and natural-gas production picked up."
  https://t.co/gzbQjXczZ7 We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of John Dingell. John was a giant in Congress for decades and it was an honor to serve with him in the House. Rep. Debbie Dingell and his family are in our thoughts and prayers. https://t.co/nY0G7kNpqL We got our first look today at Democrats’ highly anticipated  Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is a clear call for a socialist  expansion of government. The policies laid out in this resolution are simply unrealistic,  and unaffordable.

They fought against the bitter cold in order to put out the fire at Ziegenfelder Frozen Treat Co. building. https://t.co/5gIbq2jOq0 Coal is playing a vital role during the extreme weather seen throughout the country. The main takeaway is that grid operators like PJM and MISO are continuing to rely more on coal than any other electricity source during the January 30-31 polar vortex. https://t.co/IBZF0wDrHC Thank you to all the crews who continue to battle the fire at the Ziegenfelder Frozen Treat Co. building.https://t.co/1tJGyC466R It was wonderful speaking with the West Virginia United Postmasters and  Managers in the office yesterday about their legislative priorities! https://t.co/5z5TKuA9K4 Mary and I were greatly saddened to hear about the passing of Merry Ann Nehlen, wife of WVU Hall of Fame Football Coach Don Nehlen.

There must be a way to fund the govt and include resources for border security. Senate Dems should stop playing games and let's find a solution that achieves both (2/2) It's disappointing that Senate Democrats are so focused on playing politics they won't vote for anything that includes funding for a wall or fencing. On Thursday, the House voted to keep the government open AND fund the wall.

Huge thanks to @SenJackReed, @SenatorCollins, @LisaMurkowski, and @SenGillibrand in the Senate… The bill now goes to the President's desk for signature. We're glad to honor Lt. Albarati's life with this bill and take a step to ensure safety of correctional officers. #FirstStepAct 2/2 The House just passed the #FirstStepAct bipartisan criminal justice reform. It includes our Lt. Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act which provides for safe storage of personal firearms for corrections officers to protect them going to and leaving work. 1/2 This is good news for our valley: JSW Steel will hire 1,000 workers at its plant across the river in Mingo Junction
https://t.co/NuC6tkb9II Yesterday @POTUS signed into law @SenCapito's bill to name the @NASAIVV facility in Fairmont after trailblazing NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson. As the sponsor of this bill in the House we were pleased to help with this well-deserved recognition! December 7, 1941: "A day which will live in infamy." Each year fewer and fewer Americans are left who actually remember Pearl Harbor. It's up to the rest of us to carry on the memory of the Americans killed there, and the attack that spurred America to action &amp; changed history. https://t.co/NWpWPkvdPy Good news: @USDOT announced a $20 million grant for Corridor H in Tucker Co. Completing Corridor H is essential for economic development in the region. We were glad to support this grant w/ @SecElaineChao! @gordongee West Virginia is lucky to have you. Thank you for your vision and leadership. Mary and I are at the National Cathedral to pay our respects to our 41st President. A beautiful setting to remember him. Today should be a day of mourning but also a celebration of his remarkable life. https://t.co/k5f6qqUq9s Thank you @SecretaryPerry for your leadership and working with us to highlight the potential and need for a ethane storage hub in Appalachia. It is good for the region and good for America. @ENERGY This reports reaffirms what we've been saying for years. We need to capitalize on the resources we have in West Virginia and Appalachia, and use our natural gas liquids to attract manufacturing, investment, &amp; jobs. https://t.co/bf0dTZZqSh We had a productive meeting with leaders from local law enforcement agencies in Mon County this morning. Good discussion focused on countering the drug crisis and criminal justice reform proposals in Congress. https://t.co/e6GrsaFQqV Good luck to all players, coaches and students in Wheeling this weekend for the Super Six high school football championships. Proud to have three schools representing the First District -- Fairmont Senior, Williamstown, @WCCHSFootball.

Good be with my friends from @AmericasPower this morning to talk about the outlook for coal in the next 2 years.

POWER Act (HR 5176) helps reduce repeat overdoses
ALTO Act (HR 5197) encourages alternative pain treatment
Emmett's Law (HR 5695) improves info sharing between providers &amp; families
AIDD Act (HR 5628) increases access to safe Rx disposal Minutes ago @POTUS signed H.R. 6 the comprehensive, bipartisan opioid package into law. The bill will help expand access to treatment, improve prevention programs, and give law enforcement the tools they need. Simply put, this will save lives. https://t.co/TalU3fwT4d This is an important step to help close the skills gap. Glad to be part of it. https://t.co/n8ZOn0XLbs Glad to see the President sign the bipartisan America's Water Infrastructure Act, which will invest in the waterways that our economy depends on and improve access to clean, safe drinking water.

https://t.co/RjEywho4YV Also hosted a roundtable with veterans @AmericanLegion Post 15 in Parkersburg. As always, a lively discussion. This was our 80th meeting in the district with veterans since 2011! https://t.co/4ARRE2wKK7 Busy day in Wood County. Talked about West Virginia's economic resurgence at the monthly legislative breakfast, and had the chance to catch up with some old friends while I was it. https://t.co/oVFCAG3sJk Glad to see President Trump sign these two bills to increase transparency on drug pricing. This is a common sense step to end the "gag clause" that prevents pharmacists from discussing lower cost options with patients.
https://t.co/deis1YZsgm Investing in our water infrastructure is important both for our economy and quality of life. Happy to see this bill one step closer to law. https://t.co/IrX0otTgQK Glad the @nytimes picked up on what many of us already know: communities like Thomas &amp; Davis have a lot to offer, from natural beauty to great craft beer. We hope those of you outside WV will come and see for yourself! cc @WVtourism  #WildandWonderful 
https://t.co/ADWATxP9j6 Mary and I send our condolences to the family of Wood Co. Delegate Frank Deem, who passed away earlier today. I had the honor of serving with Frank in @wvlegislature. Frank was an institution in WV politics and spent his life in service to WV and America. Rest in peace. Protecting access to cancer treatments is exactly why we've led the bipartisan fight to reverse cuts to #340b providers. The drug pricing program helps safety-net hospitals provide important care to people. We will continue to work to undo these cuts.
https://t.co/zniLM2KFy5 Nice to visit with @UAPipeTrades Local 152 in Morgantown this morning. Good discussion about training and workforce issues. They do important work to promote a skilled workforce. https://t.co/4nzjElKNBl Great to work with my friend @DonaldNorcross on this important bill. Vital to ensure a skilled workforce. https://t.co/DC5oVqCYpi Happy to help. https://t.co/z218dorohT Finally, H.R. 5628, the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act was also included. The AIDD Act will improve access to drug disposal programs for leftover Rx medicine. A majority of opioid users become addicted with pills from friends and family. This will reduce the availability. Emmett's Law (H.R. 5695) will educate health professionals about information on substance abuse and overdoses they can share with family members. For the story behind this bill watch this video: https://t.co/g3DMqWgynO H.R. 6 also includes the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) Act (H.R. 5197) that we introduced with @BillPascrell. The ALTO Act builds on a successful model used in NJ to encourage alternative pain management in the ER, where many patients are first prescribed addictive medicine. H.R. 6 includes four bills we have championed. First, the POWER Act (H.R. 5176), which we introduced with @USRepMikeDoyle. It will help reduce repeat overdoses by helping patients get connected with treatment options directly following an overdose. The Senate just passed major bipartisan opioid legislation -- H.R. 6 is now on its way to be signed into law. This is a significant step in the ongoing fight against this epidemic. It will increase access to treatment, improve prevention, and give law enforcement more tools. Good discussion with staff @WVUMedicine Chestnut Ridge Center this am. Increasing &amp; improving access to treatment for opioid addiction comes up often. Dr. Berry and his team are developing new treatment models and training providers across WV. https://t.co/FxMdRVagXf You can check out some coverage of our meetings with small businesses in Moundsville yesterday here:
https://t.co/oGHZdqMSs2 Visited with the McMechen Long Term Recovery committee earlier today. A lot of progress has been made since flooding devastated the town in July 2017, but more work needs to be done to help the families hurt by the flood. https://t.co/Pd0XZudAZ3 Met with a number of local small businesses in Moundsville earlier today. Stopped in Hometown Floral &amp; Gifts, Ruttenberg's, and several others. Small businesses are vital for our economy and our communities. Lot's of optimism about things turning around in WV. https://t.co/Cr6bw3rUxF And Gov. Justice pledged that the additional funds would be allocated to shoring up PEIA and provide for a second round of 5% pay increases.  This is the good news we’ve been working towards. Economic recovery is surging in WV.  Gov. Justice just announced that increases in personal income and severance taxes have provided $120 million in excess of estimates.  Both are byproducts of federal regulatory reform on coal and gas and the cuts in individual taxes. WesBanco Arena in Wheeling was rockin’ tonight for the Trump Rally.  He pledged to continue the reforms to regulations and taxes until everyone benefits and confirmed that pre-existing conditions would be included in any healthcare reform. Proud to support and contribute to this vital legislation. The opioid crisis touches every family and every community. H.R. 6 includes a number of important steps to combat the epidemic. https://t.co/eCUjfnLB08 It was good meeting again with my friends from the @MineWorkers.

They are on the front lines of the crisis -- we can be more effective by listening to their ideas. Expanding access to safe disposal and drug takeback locations will help get pills off our streets. That's why we introduced the bipartisan Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act (H.R. 5628), which will reduce costs associated with takeback programs.
