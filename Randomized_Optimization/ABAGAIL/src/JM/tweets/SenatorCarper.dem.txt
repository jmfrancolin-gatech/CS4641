Some of the lowlights from @EPA‚Äôs 2018 figures:
 
‚¨áÔ∏èLeast civil penalties against polluters since 1994
‚¨áÔ∏è Inspection rates at half the amount of 2010
‚¨áÔ∏è Least civil cases started and completed in 10 years
‚¨áÔ∏è Least criminal defendants charged since 1991
 
https://t.co/DqSqeUlc5j These numbers released by @EPA prove just how dedicated @realdonaldtrump is to letting pollution go unanswered.

What counts is what you do when your feet hit the ground. #SOTU At a time when millions of jobs in this country are going unfilled, it's senseless to demonize those who come here, follow the rules and work hard. Mr. Agui√±aga and his family attend our schools, contribute to our economy and help make the First State an even better place to live There are millions of immigrants in our country, just like Mr. Agui√±aga, who have fled crime, poverty, violence and political unrest and who are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families. What‚Äôs more, they are here helping to make our communities stronger. Over the last two months especially, there has been a great deal of discussion about border security and immigration reforms. Too often, though, both sides go back and forth arguing over specific policy points and lose sight of the very real people at the heart of this debate. For tonight‚Äôs #SOTU, I‚Äôm excited and honored to be joined by Juan Manuel Agui√±aga, a business owner from Newark, Delaware and a newly naturalized United States citizen. https://t.co/qHluI1XxFW RT @SenateDems: At last year‚Äôs #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump promised American workers they would get a $4,000 raise from his tax law.

And, just last week, even @USChamber acknowledged that the way to seriously address migration to our border is to provide aid to the Northern Triangle countries in Central America ‚Äî Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ‚Äî and fully fund the Alliance for Prosperity. There has already been unanimous agreement in the Senate about providing funding for important border security. There is also bipartisan agreement about providing permanent protections and a pathway to legal status for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status recipients. Many of my colleagues and I have been steeped in these issues for years. We know the ins and outs and have had success finding areas of agreement in the past. We can do it again. But we cannot hold federal workers, their families and their paychecks hostage in the meantime. .@realDonaldTrump there is one way to end this shutdown: re-open the government. Once that happens, we can have serious and substantive discussions about securing our borders and fixing our broken immigration system. On emergencies at Superfund sites, EPA says: "...we may be limited in our ability to provide a substantive response depending on the issue involved"

Day after day, the #TrumpShutdown continues to threaten public health and our environment.

For special agents, financial security is national security.‚Äù
 
@realDonaldTrump, the nation's safety is at risk -- end the shutdown now. https://t.co/zwfbbFCsVA With the agency‚Äôs doors shuttered, @EPA is directing some of its few employees to prepare the Acting Administrator for a confirmation hearing instead of monitoring Superfund sites, cleaning up spills, evaluating chemical safety and protecting air and water https://t.co/T2CrOp9XvW .@realDonaldTrump has created his own narrative to suit his political purposes. For the rest of us, facts still matter. And we cannot discuss his trip to the border today without highlighting the truth about border security. If @realDonaldTrump was truly interested in a solution, he would fund the Alliance for Prosperity which helps to create economic growth and opportunities in Central America so that families don‚Äôt have to flee their homeland in search of safety https://t.co/nGxUMYfGde Shamefully, we‚Äôve focused more on ways to keep migrants out of our country rather than helping them address the misery in their homelands ‚Äì misery we‚Äôve helped create and are complicit in due to our appetite for illegal drugs The Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are some of the most dangerous in the world. I've seen firsthand the conditions that force so many to flee for their lives. Instead of a photo-op, @realDonaldTrump should be going to Central America. FACT #11 (and the most important one): The overwhelming majority of migrants arriving at our southern border are not criminals trying to evade border patrol officers. They are families fleeing unspeakable violence in Central America who are surrendering and asking for help. As my friend @LeaderHoyer rightly pointed out, Republicans who are knowledgeable about border security have repeatedly acknowledged that a physical barrier is not an effective or cost-efficient solution https://t.co/qMA7zGnzx9 FACT #10: The notion that a wall is not a smart investment is not just a position held by Democrats and those who work along our border every single day. Republicans think so, too. .@USCG provides helicopters, aircraft, and fast boats for our border that are vital to interdicting drugs headed for our communities. @TSA deploys agents to patrol airports and mass transit hubs for suspicious activity, looking to prevent attacks. They are crucial to our security FACT #9: By shutting down our government and forcing the men and women in the Coast Guard and TSA to work not knowing if or when they‚Äôll get paid, @realDonaldTrump is actually putting our security at risk. FACT #8: Congress has already funded 650 miles of fencing along our southern border in places where it actually makes sense. @realDonaldTrump should listen to experts and those on the frontlines who know that there are many places along our border where a wall won‚Äôt work. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump refused to take yes for an answer and chose, instead, to reject the same funding levels he agreed to last year‚Äîand needlessly shut down our government FACT #7: Democrats and Republicans have provided this administration with border security funding. Over the last 2 years, Congress has appropriated $1.7 billion for border security. In December, the Senate voted 100-0 to provide an ADDITIONAL $1.6 billion https://t.co/s2YiaEcxEb And despite @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs repeated promises that Mexico would pay for it, the cost of his ineffective, 2,000-mile border wall will ultimately fall to American taxpayers. FACT #6: @realDonaldTrump wants $5.7 billion for a wall right now, but that will merely be a down payment. His own @DHSgov estimates that the wall could cost around $21 billion to complete ‚Äì not including maintenance, operations or cost of acquiring land https://t.co/FCAOWpjy0Z According to @realDonaldTrump's own Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come into our country through legal ports of entry. A border wall will not keep deadly drugs like heroin out of our communities https://t.co/ule8lM9qcU FACT #5: @realDonaldTrump keeps repeating a misleading claim that drugs are pouring into our country through the border. Fact check: my report with @senrobportman reveals the deadliest drug in the U.S. is mostly getting in through the U.S. Postal Service. https://t.co/DuffUxz4O5 According to @GAO‚Äôs report, between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, @CBP recorded a total of 9,287 breaches in pedestrian fencing. It is clear that a wall is not a silver bullet for securing our border. FACT #4: Our country‚Äôs independent watchdog could not determine a barrier‚Äôs real security benefit. @GAO made clear that migrants have cut through fencing, burrowed under fencing, used a ramp to drive over fencing, and simply jumped over fencing https://t.co/vx28SOgKF6 FACT #3: For years now, more Mexicans have been leaving the U.S. to return to Mexico than have arrived in our country. https://t.co/YiqqZ3UUlR FACT #2: Despite @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs claim that we have a new crisis at our border, the investments that Democrats and Republicans have made to secure our border over the years have paid off.
 
Apprehensions at the southern border are down 82% since 2000. https://t.co/kTE6PRqR4r These technologies cost a lot less than building a wall‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand, unlike @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs steel barrier, they have actually proven effective. https://t.co/FkCHiUQ4MI Technologies like radar, drones, underground sensors and aircraft are smart investments that help agents perform their mission and get better results along our borders. FACT #1: Border patrol officers have made clear time and time again that technology ‚Äì not a wall ‚Äì is the key to securing our border. David Aguilar, former @CBP deputy told senators ‚ÄúTechnology is going to be the highest need the border patrol has.‚Äù https://t.co/MnVeGAFJQk .@realDonaldTrump is visiting the border today for a photo-op and, if his speech the other night is any indication, we can expect more lies.

It‚Äôs time for @realDonaldTrump to end the tantrum, stop holding American workers‚Äô pay hostage, and take yes for an answer. https://t.co/E2rNxX1kfg Communities in California, West Virginia, and every state in between are paying the price for the Trump administration‚Äôs reckless rollbacks of important environmental protections. A must read from @nytimes: https://t.co/awelFTviBj Wishing all those celebrating today a very #MerryChristmas! Sending best wishes to you and your loved ones today, and hoping that the spirit of this season can help to renew and unite our world in the days and weeks to come Trump wants America to think the #TrumpShutdown is a fight about border security. 

In reality, he‚Äôs used less than 6% of funding already given to him for border security. Some good news in the midst of the #TrumpShutdown: my bipartisan bill that ensures the US will continue to lead in nuclear innovation cleared the House and is on its way to be signed into law. A good step in our fight against climate change. RT @SenWhitehouse: Thanks to my Dem colleagues @SenatorCarper and @CoryBooker, and across the aisle @SenJohnBarrasso and @MikeCrapo for bei‚Ä¶ Now @realDonaldTrump has gotten what he said he wanted ‚Äî a shutdown that puts our economy at risk and forces federal employees to work without pay just days before Christmas. 

The absolute least our government should be able to do is keep the lights on. Americans deserve better. This shutdown could have easily been avoided. Two days ago, the entire Senate ‚Äî 100 Democrats and Republicans ‚Äî voted to fund the government at the exact same levels President Trump agreed to last year. But, once again, @realDonaldTrump refused to take yes for an answer. A #Trumpshutdown means 54,000 Customs and Border Patrol officers ‚Äì the agents who actually work to secure the border ‚Äì will work without pay over Christmas. If @realDonaldTrump was serious about border security, he wouldn‚Äôt shutdown the agency responsible for securing our borders Your own words are very stubborn things, @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Bj8ZtgVs3K .@realDonaldTrump says this fight is about border security. It is not. 
   
Over the last two years, Congress has appropriated $1.7 billion for border security. The Trump Administration has spent less than 6% of that funding. Secretary Mattis is a real leader who understands that partnerships with our allies and principled stands against our adversaries make our country stronger.

His resignation underscores the recklessness of President Trump's agenda, and it should give us all pause. https://t.co/FPCtsT0Kqm My bill with Senator @lisamurkowski incentivizes replacing these old wood heaters with newer, clean-burning ones - protecting public health and creating new jobs in the process https://t.co/39Dn7gVGRA Outdated, inefficient woodstoves are the 2nd biggest source of particulate matter pollution in Delaware ‚Äì increasing asthma attacks, lung damage and other respiratory problems throughout the state The bill - named the Coastal Barrier Resources Act - makes a common sense fix to allow Delaware homeowners to access the flood insurance they should be entitled to.
