We can never let that evil take hold in our great nation.  #SOTU As the founder and co-chair of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, I have long advocated for our children battling cancer.

This shutdown has gone on long enough, has hurt patriotic public servants in the process, and only serves to undermine our credibility abroad. 

It is time to come together. 

It is time to end this shutdown. A full solution to end the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border must include constructing physical barriers, providing the latest technology,  authorizing more boots on the ground, and closing the legal loopholes in our current immigration system. Today’s announcement exhibits the President's leadership &amp; willingness to negotiate a solution to secure our borders &amp; end this government shutdown for the American people. I urge Congressional leaders of both parties to accept the President’s proposal and reopen the government. Happy Birthday to the Leader of @HouseAppropsGOP and fellow Texan, @RepKayGranger. RT @HouseForeignGOP: Ranking Member @RepMcCaul: “#UNSC Resolution 2231 called on the Iranian regime not to undertake ballistic missile laun… I fought passionately for this funding following #Harvey &amp; I remain committed to ensuring it’s used as intended — for Army Corps projects to mitigate future flooding disasters. Texas families shouldn’t have to choose between border security &amp; disaster aid. https://t.co/W0jZ0FRVUz Democrats need to put their dishonest talking points away and take their own advice. The American people have demanded action and it’s time to deliver. Ending the partial shutdown without solving this problem will make the situation worse in the future. Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Chuck Schumer lecture others about putting politics aside and doing what’s best for the country. It was authorized by the Secure Fence Act in 2006 and supported by Chuck Schumer. This kind of flip flop is proof that the Democrats are just playing politics. Where is their counter offer? The President has shown good faith by dropping his funding demand from $25 billion to $5.7 billion and for accepting a steel barrier instead of a concrete wall. A similar barrier already exists along parts of the border. This week, Democratic leaders walked in front of the cameras and said they want border security but refused to compromise at all. This is politics at its worst. In June, every single Democrat in the House voted against my bill to build a barrier, put more boots on the ground, provide advanced technology, close legal loopholes, and create a permanent fix to DACA.  https://t.co/8EnCuG2yPe There is no question that this is a longstanding national security and humanitarian crisis.

Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are simply un-interested in securing our border and the country is suffering because of it. Drugs smugglers, violent gangs like MS-13, human traffickers, and even potential terrorists are overwhelming our southern border and infecting our neighborhoods. Families with small children are making the dangerous trek across hundreds of miles and putting their lives at risk.

My full op-ed on Sen. McCain : https://t.co/R0P17Opb8L Great meeting with @HIDGlobal in Austin about their products, which are some of the best in the world to secure identities. I have always worked to ensure that businesses with the most secure product receive contracts on national security issues. #TX10 https://t.co/6yKn32WaLr I met with officials with the City of Houston to learn about their four-year plan to secure the city from cyber threats. I offered my assistance to the city to help streamline the project as it prepares to host major upcoming events city-wide. #CyberSecurity https://t.co/ZRPJ8WlUsi I met with @AJCGlobal of Houston about our foreign policy &amp; the importance of defending human rights. Specifically we discussed Assad’s humanitarian crisis in Syria &amp; HR 380, the legislation I introduced to hold those who conduct or facilitate business with the IRGC accountable. https://t.co/rK0VF5sA5s My prayers are with @SenJohnMcCain and his family. As the true example of an American hero, he was the embodiment of patriotism. I know I join the nation in missing his spirit, determination, and love of our armed forces and our nation. Our country is at loss. After #HurricaneHarvey I led @HouseHomeland hearings in Washington and in #TX10 about the lessons learned and how we can be better prepared. I also testified before the @Transport committee about the importance of expiditing critical funding for recovery efforts. https://t.co/mgdxylC9dn In the year since #Harvey we have made tremendous strides in our recovery, but more needs to be done. I stand by willing to help however my office can as we continue to move forward, further recover, and push for infrastructure solutions to mitigate future flooding. #TexasStrong! https://t.co/D84Z38f4mI One year ago today, #HurricaneHarvey landed on our shores. Following the dreadful days on unprecedented rain and historic flooding, I was on the ground to witness the resolve of my fellow Texans and hear the stories of heroic acts that saved thousands of lives. https://t.co/nxRkF3TDaX Happy birthday to a great #Texan, Congressman John Culberson.

This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild our nation’s military. We need to ensure that at a moment’s notice, our brave men and women have the tools they need to defend our nation. https://t.co/pjWm6ui69w Great to have @SecretaryPerry in #TX10 today! https://t.co/UiqpWHXMtV Congratulations to Carla Provost on being selected as the 18th @USBPChief and the first woman to ever lead the U.S. Border Patrol. Best of luck, Chief! I applaud the administration for taking action to hold Russia accountable for its continued trampling of international law. I have led efforts in the House to pass bipartisan bills that will protect our digital networks from cyber intruders—nation states, hackers, &amp; cybercriminals—relentless in their pursuit to target our election and other critical infrastructure. https://t.co/8Ha1sTJXec According to a recent study by the @taxfoundation on job creation throughout the U.S, a projected 1.4+ million jobs will be created over the next ten years thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. https://t.co/KWtP4nnYn7 .@ICEgov’s mission is critical to protecting our national security. Ron Vitiello will continue to lead the men and women of ICE as they protect Americans from dangerous people—criminals, drug dealers, and potential terrorists. For #PurpleHeartDay, let us remember and thank the 1.8 million Purple Heart recipients for their service. I strongly support the renewed sanctions against the terror sponsoring dictatorship in Tehran. We must continue to maximize pressure and stand with the Iranian people until the regime is no longer a threat to world peace.

This innovative approach serves as a force multiplier to enhance our cybersecurity workforce. https://t.co/KiUvUrIUON I applaud @SecNielsen for taking another important step to protect U.S. critical infrastructure. DHS's new center will work with industry, agencies, &amp; other stakeholders like banks, telecom, and energy to combat cyberattacks from foreign adversaries. https://t.co/VREcFMs104 As I have continually said, Russia is working to sow discord in our democracy and we must remain vigilant of their efforts. https://t.co/sd1JHsK6JZ Very pleased @TSA announced its plan for deploying additional CT scanners throughout our nation’s airports. We must ensure that this technology is in our airports and last points of departure for inbound flights to the United States as soon as possible. https://t.co/v0FjWSLgPU I'm proud to introduce the Bipartisan ChiPACC Act with my Childhood Cancer Caucus co-chairs &amp; @RepDianaDeGette.
