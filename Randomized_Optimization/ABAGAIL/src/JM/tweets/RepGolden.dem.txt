Great meeting business owners and other folks in Bangor last week! https://t.co/jABUmYRrCS .@MEHealthEquity showed us their space in Bangor last weekend. HEAL supports our state's LGBTQ+ community, Maine people living with HIV/AIDS, &amp; those suffering from substance use disorder. We‚Äôre working with HEAL to help make sure all Mainers have access to the care they need. https://t.co/3zBAO6aCE9 RT @MEFairTradeCamp: ‚ÄúI agree with the president that #NAFTA has failed working Americans, but his NAFTA 2.0 proposal is more of the same,‚Äù‚Ä¶ Great to be in my old elementary school classroom in Leeds Monday, where I got grilled by some constituents with tough questions like:

- What's your favorite üê∂? (Border Collie/Aus Shepherd mix)
- What do your parents do? (run a small biz)
- Did you go snowshoeing for PE? (yep!) https://t.co/wN9TiLvW3C Maine‚Äôs older &amp; more rural than most of the country, which makes it hard for many Maine people to access affordable healthcare. 

We rode along with Androscoggin Home Healthcare &amp; Hospice to learn how we can help them provide quality, affordable care to Maine seniors &amp; others. https://t.co/LiRKzhMOKN Heidi Gerding‚Äôs small biz took a $100,000+ hit from the gov't shutdown. Losses that big would cripple some family businesses in Maine.

In @HouseSmallBiz today, we focused on helping small biz who haven‚Äôt recovered from the shutdown. 

Watch more here: https://t.co/CYzeAAW2aX We were in Machias last weekend, so we stopped into Helen‚Äôs restaurant and talked with folks there about what‚Äôs going on in Washington County. I‚Äôm committed to being open &amp; accessible to Maine people. It‚Äôs what we should expect from our elected officials. https://t.co/5I8p800R1m ‚ÄúThe promise behind renegotiating [NAFTA] was that we were going to see an end to the jobs going away &amp; an increase in wages for working people. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm concerned that NAFTA 2.0 falls short in a big way...‚Äù

- me &amp; @MEAFLCIO's Cynthia Phinney to @wagmtv8 https://t.co/MYWRkUP8E5 Heading into tonight's #SOTU2019, I was looking for areas where I could work with the president to get things done for Maine people. 

Here's what I took from the speech: https://t.co/aiZBndInrh 

#MEpolitics We‚Äôre hearing the president will call for both parties to put aside their differences &amp; come together. I welcome that message, but he has to back it up with leadership. We need to see concrete proposals from @POTUS and willingness to work with both parties to get this done 11/ That‚Äôs why Maine needs strong federal funding to build infrastructure that grows our economy, creates good jobs, &amp; connects our businesses and homes. I‚Äôll be listening for @POTUS to seize the moment, work across the aisle, and outline a real infrastructure plan. #mepolitics 10/ Here‚Äôs the thing: Maine isn‚Äôt NY or CA and we‚Äôre more than 90% small biz. An infrastructure plan that requires private investment and lots of state and local gov‚Äôt $$$ won‚Äôt work here. #mepolitics 9/ Investing in infrastructure is huge for #ME02. We‚Äôre 1 of the most rural districts in the US, &amp; we‚Äôre the biggest east of the Mississippi. Bad roads, bridges, rail, &amp; poor broadband internet access quite literally hold our families, workers, &amp; businesses back. #mepolitics 8/ Here‚Äôs another area where I want to work with the president: INFRASTRUCTURE. There‚Äôs a real opportunity here for both parties to work together with @POTUS and get something done for Mainers. Few states would benefit more from better roads, bridges, etc than Maine. #mepolitics 7/ I‚Äôll work with @POTUS when his policies help Mainers, but I‚Äôll fight back when his policies hurt our state. I‚Äôll work with the president to overhaul NAFTA if he's serious about protecting Maine jobs, but this deal comes up short. 6/ #mepolitics #replaceNAFTA https://t.co/41aiZiIWpA .@POTUS' NAFTA 2.0 must be changed to do more to keep good jobs in Maine and increase wages. And trade deals aren‚Äôt worth the paper they‚Äôre written on if other countries don‚Äôt play by the rules, so we need stronger enforcement provisions. #mepolitics 5/ The president‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 proposal appears to be more of the same. It looks like a new paint job on the old NAFTA, not the meaningful change we need. Too many Maine communities know where this path leads: closed mills, outsourcing, and low wage jobs. #mepolitics 4/ One thing Cynthia &amp; I have been talking about: the president's #NAFTA plans. We agree with @POTUS that NAFTA's a bad deal for American workers.

NAFTA's been a disaster for Maine's working folks. It needs a full overhaul that addresses the agreement‚Äôs root problems #mepolitics 3/ First off, thanks to Cynthia Phinney for coming all the way from Livermore Falls to be my guest tonight! Cynthia fights for working Mainers every day and she‚Äôs the first woman to be elected president of the @MEAFLCIO. 2/ #mepolitics https://t.co/XcP9Vzqgf5 THREAD: Tonight, we‚Äôll hear the president deliver his #SOTU2019 address. Here are a few things I‚Äôll be listening for during the speech: 1/ #mepolitics I‚Äôm proud to have Cynthia Phinney as my guest at #SOTU2019 tonight. Cynthia is president of @MEAFLCIO, where she fights for Maine's working people and good-paying jobs in our state. 

https://t.co/COKit1st9U Last week, we introduced the #solidarityinsalaryact to withhold pay for Congress, @potus, and @vp during government shutdowns.

Our bill's gaining momentum. Thanks to @chelliepingree, @repjimcooper, @RepTjCox, @teammoulton, @RepAGonzalez, &amp; @RepMarkMeadows for signing on! https://t.co/YMFvItS6ky Team Golden is all in for the Pats! #everythingwegot #SBLIII https://t.co/Tej0IdyPI4 In case you were wondering where @chelliepingree and I stand on #SBLIII: 

Let‚Äôs go @Patriots! #GoPats https://t.co/Mf10L2i7gm Proud to join the men and women of @GDBIW, @senatorcollins, @senangusking, @chelliepingree, and @secnav76 for the keel-laying of the future USS Carl Levin on Friday. https://t.co/i8uJBiWchX RT @Claritybear: Had a great time meeting with @RepGolden last night along with some of our @cityofbangor council &amp; staff. Grateful to have‚Ä¶ RT @chelliepingree: Great meeting this morning with @RepGolden and the machinists union Local S6 at Bath Iron Works. As we work in Washingt‚Ä¶ Over 220k Maine seniors depend on Social Security. They‚Äôve paid into the system and earned their benefits.

#SocialSecurity works. I‚Äôve cosponsored #SECURE2100 Act b/c it strengthens the program for grandparents now AND preserves it for their grandkids. 
https://t.co/lrpFIQUe1g I‚Äôm proud to support the #PayCheckFairness Act. Maine women should get equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/H9uHCVO7B5 We were all around Ellsworth last weekend meeting with folks and learning more about what Maine people in this area need to get ahead. Thanks to Gretchen Wilson from the Ellsworth Chamber for showing us around! https://t.co/ujaKzpLWXi Good leaders take care of other people before stopping to think about themselves. That‚Äôs the idea behind our Solidarity in Salary Act. 

Our bill withholds pay for Congress and the president during government shutdowns. More here from @WABI_TV5 #mepolitics https://t.co/rlG1b1rAdQ We met with @FogtownB to learn more about their thriving small business. Fogtown is helping grow Ellsworth‚Äôs economy &amp; making great beer with many ingredients grown here in Maine. On @HouseSmallBiz committee, I'm working with small businesses like this to grow &amp; create Maine jobs https://t.co/jC6IgIy5fb We joined the American Legion last weekend in Southwest Harbor for a potluck to help raise money for Maine's Coast Guardsmen &amp; their families. 

The shutdown is over, but many servicemembers will continue to feel the effects. Those who serve &amp; protect us deserve better than this. https://t.co/ICxsmzCWCd The shutdown is over and the gov't is now back open, but many Maine people will continue to feel the impact. 

Our staff is here to help folks in our district solve any problems they‚Äôre facing with federal agencies. Contact one of our offices here: https://t.co/Qa8JkSoSzl For the past 5 years, @wnsxradio has hosted a Re-Gift-a-Thon to help homeless families in the Ellsworth area. We stopped by the Hannafords last weekend to drop off some kitchen tools, talk with 97.7, and meet local folks contributing to a great cause. https://t.co/UfIbVpxWNP ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something I love about Maine. If your neighbor needs help, you help them.‚Äù - Albert Sionni

Maine communities struggled &amp; persevered through this crisis. Now Congress needs to use common sense and reach a long-term deal to keep the gov't open.
https://t.co/3TFbMXMaRg RT @RepMaxRose: Only in a town as broken as Washington do you still get paid when you don‚Äôt do your job. That‚Äôs wrong, and it‚Äôs past time t‚Ä¶ 800,000 federal workers and their families were denied their pay during the shutdown. It‚Äôs time lawmakers faced the same consequences. 

Today, I introduced a bill to withhold pay for Congress during a shutdown. Learn more about our legislation here: https://t.co/CadwEhOviQ Federal workers don‚Äôt get paid during a gov't shutdown. Neither should Congress. It‚Äôs just common sense. 

I'm introducing the bipartisan Solidarity in Salary Act today with @RepDanCrenshaw and @RepMaxRose to withhold pay from Congress, @POTUS,  &amp; @vp during a shutdown. https://t.co/Cjb5xcIAPy Excited to lead the Subcommittee on Contracting and Infrastructure and put it to work for small businesses in Maine and across the country! #mepolitics https://t.co/iSTuPuvqCe I joined the Jay-Livermore-Livermore Falls Chamber of Commerce this past weekend for their annual meeting. We had some great conversations about what businesses in Franklin County need to create more jobs in the area. #mepolitics https://t.co/aN53oMRlc2 We joined the American Legion this weekend in Southwest Harbor for a potluck to help raise money for Maine's Coast Guardsmen. 

The shutdown is over, but many servicemembers &amp; their families will continue to feel the effects. The people who serve and protect us deserve better. https://t.co/O1LjzSP93a Small, family businesses are key to our economy and part of what makes us Maine people. Small businesses support over 280,000 good jobs in our state.

On @HouseSmallBiz, I'll help ensure Maine small biz can grow, look out for their workers, and create more good jobs for Mainers. https://t.co/uJf06gZqxl I'm honored to join the Seapower &amp; Projection Forces Subcommittee, where I'll fight for our shipyard jobs and work across the aisle to strengthen our national defense.
https://t.co/QwLt6dC3yr We need to lower the cost of healthcare for Maine people across the state. It‚Äôs especially important in rural communities. 

This grant will help Pines Health Services improve affordable care to Maine people across Aroostook County.

https://t.co/4ONsuJS1Vw This deal lasts for just 3 wks. Both parties agree we need an open, functioning government, both parties agree we need strong borders, and both parties agree we need to work together. Now, it's time for Congress to do its job and put action behind its words. (2/2) #mepolitics Today, the president finally accepted a bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown. This isn't about 1 side winning and 1 side losing. It's about getting our gov't workers paid, stopping families‚Äô suffering, &amp; putting politics aside to get things done for Maine &amp; our country. (1/2) @CraigErskine3 We're sorry this is happening Mr. Erskine, and we'll help however we can. Our staff tried to call and email you earlier but unfortunately the contact information you provided hasn't worked. We'll send you a direct message to find the best way to get in touch. - staff We have the raw ingredients for a deal. Both parties believe we need to open the government &amp; pay gov't employees. Both parties believe we need to secure our border. It's time for party leaders to put actions behind their words &amp; work together to end the shutdown (4/4) Today, the President‚Äôs proposal failed in the Senate. So did the clean funding bill Democrats and some Republicans passed through the House. These failures should shake the leaders of both parties awake. It‚Äôs time to stop talking past each other and get to work. (3/4) Last weekend, I was in Presque Isle, Caribou, Littleton, Millinocket, Mapleton, Bangor, &amp; Lewiston talking with Maine people. They were very clear: they want our nation‚Äôs leaders to come to the negotiating table and end this shutdown. (2/4) There are over 1,000 federal workers in Maine affected by the shutdown. Most of them will miss their second paycheck this week. Credit card, mortgage, and heating bills are due. People who choose to public service deserve better from our gov‚Äôt. (1/4) #mepolitics I believe anyone who loves America and has the courage to serve should be given that opportunity and respected for it.

The Administration is wrong about this. I'll use my seat on the Armed Services Committee to fight for ALL our servicemembers.
https://t.co/wGU8LYf49g Looking forward to working with Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis. It was honor to be there for his induction this weekend. https://t.co/nhq5lxvIyI As we reflect on Dr. King over #MLKDay, let's aim to live up to his example of service. Opportunities to serve our community, our state, and our country are everywhere. It's up to each of us to act on them. https://t.co/Y0NdQefL7p Had some great conversations with snowmobilers in Littleton and East Millinocket this weekend. Snowmobiling is big for local economies in Maine and clubs like these help make it all possible. 

Next time, I‚Äôm driving. https://t.co/z6D9zIOwY2 Our newsletter is up and running! Click the link to receive updates on what we‚Äôre getting done for Mainers. 
https://t.co/nvEzDVNqp1 Forcing Coast Guardsmen to go without pay and allowing their families to suffer is unacceptable. All servicemembers must be paid for their service, plain and simple. @chelliepingree and I are backing a bill to pay these Mainers. 
https://t.co/vFiHzggynH We headed up to the County this weekend, where I had a chance to sit down with members of the Maine Potato Board. I look forward to working with them and their family businesses to promote and grow Maine‚Äôs agriculture economy. @saypotato https://t.co/PcLfVFlv2H Federal employees, including over 1,000 Mainers, have been hit hard by the shutdown. But they still love their jobs and they believe in service. 

Their commitment to service is something I've been thinking about a lot in the last few weeks. My thoughts:

https://t.co/CIzUjkLilm Glad @senangusking is upbeat, still working hard, and always committed to his Instagram feed!
https://t.co/TpgdLaV4TC Coming next month: Our office in Bangor! https://t.co/ZvjfsGcCQf I‚Äôll be taking my experience serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to the House Armed Services Committee. I‚Äôm honored to fight for Maine‚Äôs working people and our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. https://t.co/aH0smGKkhx Both parties have been talking past each other &amp; it has to stop. The best way to end the gov't shutdown is for the president and leaders of both parties to come to the table. They must find a way to open the gov't and secure the border with strategies that actually work. (3/3) https://t.co/4g2pOiOF7n We need gov't employees working &amp; we need effective border security. The president's wall is ineffective and unrealistic, but investing in more border agents, resources to stop drugs &amp; trafficking at ports of entry, and physical barriers where they're effective makes sense. (2/3) Maine people need solutions that get our federal employees back to work and get them paid. Now. (1/3) https://t.co/DDN84xad6x This shutdown has been brutal on working people in Maine. I just spoke on the House floor to share Mainers' stories and call for solutions that get Maine‚Äôs federal employees back to work and get them paid. We‚Äôre open in the County! We‚Äôre here to listen to and work for you, so come on by. 

7 Hatch Drive in Caribou. https://t.co/scpf9WOX0g Especially during a gov't shutdown, your elected leaders should be open &amp; accessible. I'm here to listen &amp; work with you. It's what Mainers want &amp; it's necessary for democracy to work.

We welcomed Mainers into our open house in Lewiston this weekend. It's just the beginning! https://t.co/CL3sre6zMl Come join me for coffee tomorrow from 9-10 AM at 179 Lisbon St. in Lewiston.

I'll be there to meet folks, listen, and talk about the work we're doing to end the shutdown and open the government. It‚Äôs unacceptable for Coast Guardsmen and their families to go through hard times because of a manufactured shutdown crisis. We need real, effective solutions to open the gov't and secure the border. We can do that without an unrealistic, ineffective wall
https://t.co/LT3tQgafN9 Yesterday, my staff and I opened the doors of our Lewiston office and talked with whoever walked in. It was great. 

One thing I heard loud and clear: we need to open the gov't. I'm working to find solutions that end the shutdown and pay our Coast Guardsmen and federal workers. https://t.co/HdzEd4xgxJ During the shutdown, many @EPA workers aren‚Äôt on the job to ensure Maine‚Äôs air and water are clean and Mainers are safe from harmful chemicals.

Yesterday, I voted to fund the EPA and put its inspectors back to work. We need to open the government now. https://t.co/JPTfl9YDUO I voted today to restore services at @acadianps and fund @Interior. Our bill: 

- puts our park employees back to work and pays them
- helps the park boost our state‚Äôs economy and support businesses in our district
- allows Mainers to fully enjoy the best nat‚Äôl park in the USA https://t.co/KJKLIg7y3Q Thanks to @chelliepingree, @senatorcollins, and @senangusking for working with me on this important issue. (2/2) I introduced my first bill to get things done for Mainers. 

Our bill, HR 459, puts control back in the hands of local folks in Hancock County so they can continue the clamming and worming tradition and adds iconic coastline to @acadianps. #mepolitics (1/2) https://t.co/sAqN916rsF It‚Äôs not too late to get your flu shot! I got mine today. 

This season‚Äôs flu is hitting Maine hard, so it‚Äôs especially important to get a shot this year. 

Find out where to get a free flu shot here ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
https://t.co/iZ38MyWJsp https://t.co/QZqgevZA4p A great Maine tradition stretching from Cornville to Skowhegan!
https://t.co/CQsEuCXXWG I‚Äôm focused on solutions, which is why we're passing bills in the House this week to open the gov't as soon as we can. (2/2)
https://t.co/LaiIWLCYUF The men and women of @USCGNortheast are worried about mortgages, rent, and putting food on the table because of the shutdown. Mainers are not political props. Real people are being hurt. (1/2) https://t.co/GLWxgnw1AB The Smiths from Madison can't close on a house during the shutdown because @USDA is closed. This shutdown is real for Mainers.

I‚Äôm helping pass bipartisan bills this week to open the government as soon as possible. It's what's best for Maine. 
https://t.co/kD5SSBpUEr That's why I voted today for H.Res 6. The legislation defends Mainers' care from a Republican lawsuit that would dismantle the ACA. It's time to put up or shut up about protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Maine people want:

‚òëÔ∏è Protections for pre-existing conditions
‚òëÔ∏è Medicaid coverage for 70,000 Maine people
‚òëÔ∏è Mainers under 26 to have access to their parents' plans (1/2) Today is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Maine's law enforcement officers are deeply committed to serving the people of our district. 

I'll work closely with our police officers to keep Mainers safe in our communities. The opioid crisis hurts Mainers every day, all over our state. Our communities need help.

@chelliepingree and I are calling for increased resources and new solutions to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic in Maine.

https://t.co/xmGkA1WMww I talked with @MainePublic this morning about the government shutdown. Party leaders are missing an opportunity to come together and show the American people we can work together to get things done.

https://t.co/GyJ5eT0ihA The closure of Barclaycard in Wilton will hurt a lot of people. We're learning more about the situation and we're going to work hard to help these workers however we can. https://t.co/D1hEjxGbaU When I ran for Congress, I told Mainers I would work to restore faith in our democracy by helping remove big money and special interests from politics. 

#HR1 is the first step to following through on that commitment. #forthepeople 
https://t.co/bPrgiFDIaJ We need to strengthen our borders. But shutting down the gov't to demand more money for the president's unrealistic, irresponsible wall hurts Maine &amp; doesn‚Äôt get us closer to a secure border. I‚Äôm working with both parties to get the gov't working again and put people first (3/3) I voted with Republicans &amp; Democrats to reopen the government last week. The bills we passed strengthen the border &amp; build physical barriers where they're effective. Just as important for Maine, the bills fund infrastructure projects, open nat'l parks, &amp; pay gov't employees (2/3) The gov‚Äôt shutdown means many Maine people aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks, many Maine small businesses and their workers are hurting, and services Mainers rely on aren‚Äôt functioning. This is bad for people in our state, and it‚Äôs only going to get worse (1/3) We opened our offices in Lewiston and Caribou this week! 
We're here to listen to and work for Maine people. If you need assistance with federal programs like Medicare, Social Security, and the VA, we're here to help.

Lewiston: 179 Lisbon St. 

Caribou: 7 Hatch Drive, Suite 230 https://t.co/1kXSEtm7TM Late last night, I voted for a bipartisan plan to re-open the government. Here's my statement: https://t.co/xHn2w9rA29 Just finished my first day as a Congressman. I am honored and proud to represent Maine's second district. 

Today, we took a critical step to end the partial government shutdown. But that's just the beginning. We're ready to listen, get to work, and put people first. https://t.co/AG4OEJdC6B
