#SOTU There’s room for common ground to deliver results for the American people when it comes to: 

Maintaining military readiness
Rebuilding our infrastructure
Lowering health care costs.

Let’s’ get to work. #SOTU I agree that in this political moment we face a critical choice-- will resistance and retribution define the next two years or will we work together to deliver a strong, safe, and prosperous America? I choose the latter. #SOTU The past 2 yrs of defense spending allowed our military to grow, strengthen &amp; prosper. Funding levels should be continued in FY20 and enabled by a budget cap deal to stem the effects of sequestration. Our military depends on it. Our country’s security depends on it #SOTU We have made such strides towards rebuilding our military, including finally delivering a full year of appropriations for the first time in a decade. We must not lose the momentum that we have worked so hard to build. #SOTU Thank you @POTUS for affirming the right to life. I know this means a lot to the countless constituents I’ve had call in about late-term abortion this past week. #SOTU We need a health care system that protects individuals w/ pre-existing conditions and empowers individuals and families to make decisions for themselves based on what best fits their needs, wants, and budget. #SOTU Other #VA01 projects I’ll be working to include address this Congress: 
Replacing Norris Bridge
Widening &amp; depending Virginia port
Extending I-95 Express Lanes
Lane expansion of Route 301
Addressing I-66 tolls
Resolving the Coleman Bridge toll

#SOTU .@POTUS is emphasizing how an infrastructure package will unleash economic growth. Broadband investment must be a priority. Rural Broadband will play a critical role in bringing health care costs down, connecting rural economies, &amp; unleashing untapped economic growth. #SOTU I’ve been waiting for my colleagues to come to the negotiation table and finally recognize the crisis at our border for the true threat to our national security and sovereignty that it is. Can’t delay any longer. #SOTU Our immigration system is broken. It’s very clear border security is national security, and without strong, serious changes we are putting our entire country at risk. #SOTU Success from reg rollback &amp; tax reform is unmatched. To sustain the growth we’ve got to think long term. That means preparing our workforce to meet the needs of a 21st century economy. A lot gets lost between headlines &amp; partisan bickering. But the fact is our economy is producing record job numbers, creating opportunities for Americans from every single walk of life. 

That's worth celebrating! #SOTU Yes, Mr. President! Nothing in the world can compete with America! 🇺🇸#SOTU Here we go! Ready to hear what @POTUS priorities are. #SOTU Coming up on @FOX5DC to chat about what I hope to hear in tonight’s #SOTU. Tune in at 5:00PM! RT @MDSeaGrant: "For me, it's a labor of love. It's the reason I got into politics." U.S. Rep. Rob @RobWittman on what drives his advocacy… We’ll be hearing @POTUS priorities &amp; a call for Congress to work together at #SOTU tonight.

But we can’t move forward when we’re headed for more shutdowns. Congress needs to step up &amp; change the status quo of shutdown politics. Here’s how:

https://t.co/IYLnw2QXCg We're in the middle of a shutdown &amp; members rushed out of DC for a 3-day wknd.

This is why Americans don’t trust Congress with their money. If Members are using taxpayer money to fly, they should fly like most taxpayers. 3 times now House Dems voted NO to paying federal employees while we work towards a solution to reopen government &amp; fund border security.

3 times. 

When will Speaker Pelosi stop prioritizing resistance over finding common ground?

While I’m encouraged that these new tankers were finally delivered to the USAF, I remain concerned that both the remote vision system and the centerline drogue system are not fully ready for operational use. Today the Air Force accepted its first KC-46 aerial refueling tanker – roughly 17 months later than contractually agreed upon – with significant deficiencies that still need to be remedied. https://t.co/cWrs96jixx We can’t delay a solution to this national security and humanitarian crisis any longer.

I’m joining my colleagues in Congress by signing a letter to the President requesting a briefing on the strategic reasons for the Syrian withdrawal. ISIS still has an estimated 20-30k fighters in Iraq and Syria. Allied Kurds fighting against the Syrian regime are abruptly abandoned. Russia retains a stranglehold on the Syrian regime and can expand its malign influence in the Middle East.
