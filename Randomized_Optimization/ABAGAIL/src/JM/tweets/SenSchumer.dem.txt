RT @MarkWeinerDC: .@SenSchumer on #FreePress: ‘President Trump can’t handle it’ (video) https://t.co/BEPLx3f2RU I just spoke to @FreedomForumIns. Here's what I said:

A #FreePress has always kept government in check

We rely on a free press to:
Inform
Shine light on injustice
Establish fact
Hold elected officials like me accountable

A free press is how we discern democracy from autocracy https://t.co/y0lBZGy27M Saddened to hear of the passing of Frank Robinson.

He was one of the greatest ball players of my lifetime—an elite Hall of Famer.

The 1st African American manager in @MLB history, he fulfilled Jackie Robinson’s dream, and earned a place in the history of American civil rights. The Supreme Court made the right decision to stay a Louisiana law that would cripple women’s reproductive freedom.

This law is just one of many attempts by states to undermine those freedoms.

It is vital for the Court to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. Rep. @JohnDingell was a giant. A master legislator and someone who loved the House, loved Michigan, and loved the country. 

It was a privilege to get know John and work with him. My thoughts are with his family and his wife, @RepDebDingell. Kudos to @IBM for doing the smart thing:

Investing in AI and doing it in New York. https://t.co/Dq44ptcMgg The more we learn about Trump’s family separation policy, the more calamity and cruelty we see.

Now @realDonaldTrump's administration says it doesn’t know how many children were separated and that it’s too hard to reunite them.

Appalling. https://t.co/uUdBah1BIO We need an Attorney General who can assure the Senate and the public that he will stand up to a president who believes the Justice Department exists to do his personal bidding and to protect his personal interests.

I will oppose William Barr’s nomination. https://t.co/YYJHZxBaff How can the Department of Homeland Security really be considering taking land from a Catholic church to build President @realDonaldTrump’s wall?

I’m continuing my call for @DHSgov to stop this suppression of their right to freely exercise their religion. https://t.co/fDrdQE0csd RT @GNYHA: GNYHA thanks @SenSchumer for his strong support of the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act.

#NGWSD #SheBel… This is @realDonaldTrump's Treasury Secretary saying it’s not “productive” for corporations to invest in workers and communities?!

He is dead wrong.

Read my op-ed with @SenSanders on how corporations should invest in workers before wealthy shareholders: https://t.co/7AQthdUjJr https://t.co/o7iv8PlIim RT @AGBecerra: .@SenSchumer, it was my great honor. As I've always seen it, the state of our union decides destinies... Here's to opening t… The contrast between the President’s speech &amp; Stacey Abrams’ speech was stunning.

The President was political, divisive, and at times even nasty.

Stacey was compelling, warm, uplifting, with compassion for the plights of our people but filled with hope. https://t.co/mQvlzNYyU0 Last night, @StaceyAbrams showed President Trump what real leadership looks like.
 
She was compelling, warm and caring about people and their plights, but filled with the hope and promise of the American dream. She knocked it out of the park. “The America I know is ready to fight to keep its healthcare, to root out public corruption, and treat everyone in our nation with respect.”

I’m so proud Xavier Becerra, California’s Attorney General, just gave the Democratic Response to the State of the Union in Spanish. #SOTU https://t.co/eOpzeYPSAy I want to thank President @realDonaldTrump for being the warm up act.

Now we have the real show:

The great Stacey Abrams from the State of Georgia. #SOTU https://t.co/rLTSTEWCT7 I invited Governor @RicardoRossello to the #SOTU to remind President @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans of our duty to our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico still working to rebuild their lives and communities, 16 months later. https://t.co/XEoYW6F4EI I’m here with Ronan Byrne and his wife Stefanie.

A Long Island air traffic controller, Ronan is the definition of a dedicated federal worker. He and his family were put through the wringer by the #TrumpShutdown for no reason.

I couldn’t be more proud to bring Ronan to #SOTU. https://t.co/IgwCqpGQjb Tengo el honor de haber invitado a @ricardorossello al #SOTU.
 
La presencia del Gob. Rossello será un recordatorio importante para @realDonaldTrump y los Republicanos que aún falta mucho por hacer para completar la recuperación de Puerto Rico. https://t.co/PDsPiEgbGE I'm so honored to have invited the Governor of Puerto Rico @RicardoRossello to tonight's #SOTU.

Governor Rossello's attendance serves as a reminder to @realDonaldTrump and Republicans that our work in Puerto Rico is far from over. https://t.co/3xj0upWad8 Every president uses the State of the Union to set goals, but few have done it so cheaply and indifferently.

Many of the promises from President @realDonaldTrump's last #SOTU were discarded mere weeks after they were made. https://t.co/B9O4LWHUXG Meet Ronan Byrne.

He’s a Long Island air traffic controller &amp; father of 4 sons under 5 years old.

Even uncertain when they’d receive their paychecks, federal employees like Ronan showed up for work every day of the #TrumpShutdown.

I'm so proud to bring Ronan with me to #SOTU. https://t.co/aaW0G9S6B9 Thanks for watching my speech but you must have missed this line:

“Even more empty than his policy promises are President Trump’s calls each year for unity”

#SOTU https://t.co/dtKUKBnNlK President Trump will report tonight on the state of our union.

But, the state of the Trump economy is failing America’s middle class.

The state of the Trump healthcare system is failing American families.

The state of the Trump Administration is chaos. https://t.co/TFZmaoD2Jw With detective work &amp; federal government cooperation, this alleged killer is no longer on the run.

Since the tragic day when the Tolstykh family learned of Vladimir's death, his wife Rita &amp; children worked tirelessly with NYPD.

David Bernhardt might be the most special-interest-driven nominee President @realDonaldTrump could have selected to be the U.S. Interior Secretary. 
 
And that’s saying something considering he would be following former Secretary Ryan Zinke. RT @SenSanders: .@SenSchumer and I are here to say: corporations must address the needs of workers before the interests of wealthy stockhol… RIGHT NOW: I’m sitting down with @SenSanders.

The past two years have been extremely disappointing for millions of workers. 

We’re pushing legislation that demands that corporations address the needs of their workers before their wealthy stockholders. https://t.co/jk98j7m5JW At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions to boost their stock’s value to further enrich the wealthy few.
 
My @NYTimes op-ed with @SenSanders: https://t.co/7AQthdUjJr Whether the state of the Trump economy,

the state of our healthcare system,

or the state of the Trump Administration,

the state of our union is in need of drastic repair.

Democrats will fight for workers, healthcare, and government accountability. https://t.co/McjEwLluJm I am old enough to remember when Republicans and the WSJ claimed the Trump tax scam would lead to a huge boost in worker wages and a “miracle” for the middle class.

But then corporations used tax cuts for stock buybacks and this happened... https://t.co/SvSW3ULcCx https://t.co/m5sUHMNgId In this Congress, @SenSanders and I will push legislation that demands that corporations commit to addressing the needs of their workers and communities before wealthy stockholders.

Our @NYTimes op-ed on limiting corporate stock buybacks: https://t.co/7AQthdUjJr I agree. It’s past time. Governor Northam should resign so Virginia can move forward. https://t.co/QLZgnhdwCI We have called the Bureau of Prisons and Con Ed to demand answers, demand heat, and demand power immediately. 

We will keep pushing until this problem is solved. This has to end. Now. 

The Bureau of Prisons cannot simply allow this to continue any longer. https://t.co/zMgd9HtsF0 They pretend they want to protect your healthcare.

But they are still suing to end protections for pre-existing conditions.

READ: @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are STILL trying to “terminate” protections pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/QK9p5pVFws RT @WhipClyburn: As we begin #BlackHistoryMonth, I am proud to share the dialogue I had with @RepRichmond where we explored our past as wel… A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.

Jackie Robinson's life impacted millions.

The example he set on and off the field in Brooklyn and across the country has always been a source of pride and inspiration to me.

Happy 100th, #JackieRobinson. The president’s Buy America executive order is as worthless to American workers as the president’s empty promise to create Foxconn manufacturing jobs.
 
For two years, President @realDonaldTrump has talked the talk but he never walks the walk when it comes to #BuyAmerica. https://t.co/AeqHztDhtE It’s past time for U.S. Intelligence Community leaders to stage an intervention with @realDonaldTrump.

My letter to Dan Coats, the Director of National Intelligence: https://t.co/RVC2WvVcj7 Joe Hynes was Brooklyn's District Attorney for more than a decade. He dedicated his life to justice. He made his legacy increasing our focus on domestic violence, prosecution of hate crimes, and institution of alternative sentencing.
 
Rest in peace, Joe. Fred Korematsu defied unjust internment for Japanese Americans in WWII.

After arrest, he fought to the Supreme Court.

When Korematsu v US upheld the arrest, that terrible decision didn't stop him fighting for truth &amp; justice for all.

Today he would have been 100. Godspeed Fred We must make sure that everyone is counted.

I’m so proud to introduce legislation with @SenatorMenendez, @SenBooker, and @MazieHirono that fights to stop the U.S. census from being subverted by @realDonaldTrump’s administration for political purposes.

https://t.co/qTEQtPdtP2 Why are Republicans always afraid of making it easier for Americans to vote? 🤔 https://t.co/ZhwTipIW6A Stanley Hill was a powerful warrior for working families.

He led NYC's largest public employees union @DistCouncil37 for more than a decade.

And his work left an indelible mark on New York.

My prayers go to his family and everyone who knew &amp; loved him. https://t.co/wFjAPnYqP0 Cold temperatures and lots of snow is nothing Western New Yorkers can’t handle, but please use caution. Bundle up and stay safe! https://t.co/ArPmKVlJng Next Tuesday night, @realDonaldTrump will be the warm-up act for the real deal:

Stacey Abrams.

https://t.co/pCxnefFJr2 I am proud to announce that @AGBecerra will deliver the Spanish response to the State of the Union.

Xavier Becerra embodies the promise of America and his moral and vigilant leadership is a critical marker for all who believe that our country’s best days are still ahead of us. Estoy orgulloso de anunciar que @AGBecerra dará la respuesta en español al #EstadodelaUnión.

El encarna la promesa de los Estados Unidos y su liderazgo moral y vigilante es un marcador crítico para todos los que creen que los mejores días de nuestro país aún están por venir. Stacey Abrams is a great spokesperson, incredible leader

She has led the charge for voting rights

She knows what working class &amp; middle class people go through

@SpeakerPelosi &amp; I are excited she’s agreed to give the Democratic response to @realDonaldTrump’s State of the Union https://t.co/wketlkrg1e Our economy suffered an $11 billion loss in the shutdown.

Individual costs are harder to see. Who knows how many fed workers missed a doctor’s appointment, fell behind on payments.

And @realDonaldTrump still must explain how he'll pay fed contractors. https://t.co/LPnIf8l3zv What @TheJusticeDept did with Huawei is right on.

I know it’s tempting, President @realDonaldTrump, but when China calls and begs you to back off, don’t do it (like when you backed off with ZTE). https://t.co/Z7ho0i6tky But for TWO Senate Republicans, the U.S. Senate could have prevented: 

- Sanctions relief on 3 Russian companies.

- Purportedly a billion dollars of debt relief for Oleg Deripaska, an individual reportedly under investigation by the special counsel.

https://t.co/XqW2odtao5 This shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, including $3 billion in economic activity that can't be recovered.

Let me repeat: The #TrumpShutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion.

What a devastating &amp; pointless exercise this has been.

@realDonaldTrump: No more shutdowns. https://t.co/MbVungM051 President @realDonaldTrump's shutdown caused serious damage to our economy.

If he didn’t appreciate the error of his ways after seeing federal workers suffering from his needless shutdown, maybe this economic damage he inflicted will set him straight.

No more Trump Shutdowns. https://t.co/lF75bLXvGv Republicans promised that their tax giveaway to corporate America and the wealthiest few was going to be a ‘middle class miracle.’

That was a lie. 

American workers were promised a $4,000 raise. Many got a pink slip instead.

They have to fix this. Now. https://t.co/G1X1pika74 74 years ago today, Auschwitz was liberated.

We must remember. And we must teach our children about the Holocaust to make sure such evil is never revisited on the Jewish people or on any other people.

#WeRemember #HolocaustRemembranceDay I’m so proud of this Brooklyn baby as he keeps exploring his new world. https://t.co/fz0o0ALES0 It’s hard to believe my grandson Noah is 2 months old. https://t.co/NoVOGK65lm I hope that President @realDonaldTrump has heard our federal workers and their families. I hope he's heard Democrats in Congress.

No more Trump shutdowns.

No more holding federal workers hostage. As Democrats have said all along, the solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security. This agreement endorses that position.

I’m about to talk to the press with @SpeakerPelosi. Watch: https://t.co/nX1TuDpEJP The longest shutdown in American history will finally end. The president has agreed to our request to open the government then debate border security. This is great news for 800,000 federal workers &amp; millions of Americans who depend on government services. https://t.co/lXuepIC2kJ We need to end this #TrumpShutdown.

This afternoon for the 1st time since @realDonaldTrump shut government down, the Senate will have a chance to vote on a clean bill to re-open government &amp; provide disaster aid.

I hope the Senate rises to the occasion.  https://t.co/SDrJGAEFIu Wilbur Ross is @realDonaldTrump’s Secretary of Commerce.

Wilbur Ross is a billionaire.

And this is billionaire Wilbur Ross saying he doesn’t understand why federal workers not getting paid during the #TrumpShutdown don’t just take out loans *to feed their families*.

Unreal. https://t.co/YHHZqKa8sx This is President @realDonaldTrump’s former Chief of Staff.
Who left just recently.
Calling for the President to re-open the government.
Without the wall. https://t.co/YSTQRqCYW0 Our uninsured rate just hit a 4-year high.

Why? Years of GOP sabotage to our health care system.

AND @realDonaldTrump's admin just proposed decreasing tax credits that help Americans pay for health care.

Enough. Stop sabotaging Americans’ health care. https://t.co/7JQbBDjXmP First, @realDonaldTrump shut down the government.
Then, he rejected offers to reopen it.
Now, he’s demanding his that the government stay closed unless he gets his way.

Mr. President: Stop holding federal workers hostage and re-open the government. https://t.co/1WBF3k7NOC The Senate will have a chance to vote on a clean proposal to reopen the government.

It is a way to reopen the government while we resolve our differences.

If you're worried about federal employees going without pay in the #TrumpShutdown, this is the way. https://t.co/98gZPOCoS0 Moose. Mike Mussina. It’s an amazing night for @Yankees pitchers.

1. @realDonaldTrump’s plan. Not reasonable. Not a compromise. Never intended to pass. It’s merely an attempt to save face.

2. A clean bill to re-open government &amp; provide disaster aid.

Will @SenateGOP finally join us? https://t.co/RsO9w42N5O The #TrumpShutdown is now in its thirty-second day.

Essential government services are straining under the lack of resources.

And 800,000 public servants continue to languish without pay. https://t.co/98gZPOCoS0 More than five decades after Dr. King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and declared “I have a dream,” we are still struggling to overcome injustice and truly make his dream a reality.

It’s our great unfinished business. #MLKDay https://t.co/DicCmWmFed The #TrumpShutdown, which hurts the well-being of 800,000 federal workers, has disproportionately harmed African Americans.

The best way for @realDonaldTrump to honor Dr. King’s legacy would be to open the government.

#MLKDay https://t.co/cXlFAUXxfi Today, we all remember what Dr. King went through, the immense obstacles he overcame.

He never lost his faith, his conviction to make America a better place.

By ceaselessly fighting against the worst impulses in our country, he inspired the better angels of our nature.

#MLKDay https://t.co/LHWJwHEKH9 The #TrumpShutdown is just another example of this administration’s failure to fulfill the trust responsibility to Native Nations.

5 of 6 agencies serving Native Nations are shut down, including health care, law enforcement, and social services. It is day 30 of the #TrumpShutdown. We must protect the 800,000 federal workers—thousands in NY—from losing their homes, facing eviction, or falling behind on bills.

We’re fighting for new legislation to guarantee protections now &amp; in any future shutdown. https://t.co/XDvLP2bQlU It was President @realDonaldTrump who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place—offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies.

There’s only way out: open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions. With his statement on the #TrumpShutdown, it’s clear President @realDonaldTrump realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. https://t.co/u1XsWb4KBt RT @McClatchyDC: Democrats press Trump on plans to seize border wall land from unwilling churches https://t.co/Z4EbQyNLt7 To @SecNielsen:

The Trump Administration’s lawsuit against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brownsville, Texas, raises important questions on the exercise of eminent domain to build a border wall.

We ask you to respond to these questions by January 31: https://t.co/MXcfoQib9E Allegations like Buzzfeed’s make it all the more important the Special Counsel’s investigation go forward unimpeded.

AG Nominee Barr must be far more explicit &amp; unequivocal about not interfering in the investigation and pledge to make the whole Special Counsel’s report public. Shannon Kent from Pine Plains, NY was a Naval Chief Petty Officer.

She was killed 1/16 in the attack in Syria with 3 other Americans.

To Shannon's family &amp; the families of these brave members of our Armed Forces: I salute your selflessness. We owe you a debt we can never repay. President Trump failed Americans in Puerto Rico with his response to Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria.
 
Now he’s blocking aid to disaster-impacted communities in part as it would provide American children and families in Puerto Rico with food security.
 
Shameful. https://t.co/9ZPaLJ50Eg President @realDonaldTrump’s admin wants to relax sanctions on Putin &amp; his cronies.

Today, Democrats &amp; Republicans in the House voted 362-53 to stop them.

But @SenateMajLdr McConnell objected. Listen: https://t.co/U3qyNPpIiP 800,000 federal employees are without pay.

Why is President @realDonaldTrump holding them hostage? https://t.co/IE2yyUPlPU How could the Trump administration not know how many children they separated from parents? Their incompetence is truly astonishing. 
 
We must hold @realDonaldTrump accountable, and we must reunite these families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/TfPcRzDx5r We here in Congress are representatives of the people.

When will they listen? https://t.co/fJ0uLAqKVh We should all applaud the Democrats and Republicans in the House who voted 362-53 to stop @realDonaldTrump’s Administration from relaxing sanctions on Putin and his cronies.

If Leader McConnell or Republicans object, thousands of federal workers—and the families who rely on them—will go without a paycheck. President @realDonaldTrump’s priorities when he shuts down the government over a temper tantrum:

↑ Make sure oil drilling doesn’t stop
↓ Make sure federal workers don’t miss a paycheck

This is not how government is supposed to function. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/LjZGXjCYC4 Stop throwing a temper tantrum and re-open the government.

#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/yxZ6GURT0m President @realDonaldTrump wants you to forget he shut down the U.S. government until American taxpayers fund a wall he insisted Mexico would pay for. Here are a few dozen examples. https://t.co/G0xvsBO6gH More than TWENTY-FIVE TIMES, President @realDonaldTrump demanded a government shutdown in an attempt to force the American people to fund an expensive, ineffective border wall he promised Mexico would pay for. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/mxUlUHbndo Después de uno de los peores desastres en la historia de los Estados Unidos, estamos exigiendo respuestas. 

Merecemos saber la verdad sobre la preparación y respuesta inadecuada del gobierno de Trump a los huracanes Irma y María. https://t.co/4iz5agGYJX After one of the worst disasters in U.S. history, we’re demanding answers.
 
America deserves to know the truth about the Trump administration’s inadequate preparedness and response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria so we can ensure it does not happen again. https://t.co/fFUNx5sDsY Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime.

My statement with @SpeakerPelosi: https://t.co/KIQPrdXEeg We woke up today to the awful news that @FDNY firefighter Steven Pollard died in the line of duty in Brooklyn last night. May God bless him, his family, and his fellow firefighters. Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, a Lieutenant Commander in the @Navy_Reserve, is departing for a tour of duty in the Middle East.

Steve, I salute you. Thank you for your service to New York and our nation. Enough with the memes. Just quit hurting innocent people and re-open the government. https://t.co/7cW20gFriH In 2019, the Trump administration is trying to undo the progress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?????

If true, I will do everything in my power to stop this, including introducing a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn it. https://t.co/Eq2br8Tr0M Heading to the White House to hear @realDonaldTrump explain why he wants to keep the government shut down until American taxpayers pay for the wall instead of Mexico. https://t.co/IQ20W63E1H To my Republican friends: Let’s re-open the government and start paying our food safety inspectors, park rangers, border patrol agents, air traffic controllers, and federal courts. 

Take up legislation that Senate Republicans already support. https://t.co/kc5igXMINh I know @realDonaldTrump wants the government shut down, but last night, the House passed two bi-partisan, GOP-drafted, and GOP-supported bills which would open the government.

He should support these bills. https://t.co/pbGshK7cqr The House just passed—with bi-partisan support—two bills to re-open government. Both have now earned GOP support in the Senate and the House.

@realDonaldTrump should support passage of these bills immediately and finally end the #TrumpShutdown. At the White House yesterday, I asked President @realDonaldTrump to give me one good reason why he should keep large portions of the government shut down while we had a separate debate about the border. He couldn't name one.
 
My interview with @AprilDRyan: https://t.co/JooUA7EkY9 @LauraLitvan He called for a shutdown over
And over
And over
And over
And… I don’t have enough characters to write this more than 20 times.
 
Is anyone surprised that @realDonaldTrump wants to keep the government shut down? https://t.co/KMWevDWd7e Amazing to have you with us, @SenJackyRosen. The Senate needs your voice. https://t.co/DCIMJJCsyF Welcome to the Senate, @SenatorSinema. We're so proud you're joining us. https://t.co/3Lt0UVgZeC Allow me to welcome all of the new members who were just sworn in for the first time as senators and my friends who were re-elected to this body.

We are entrusted with an awesome responsibility:

To conduct the vital business of this country we all love. https://t.co/1HjImNp4nJ Congratulations to @NancyPelosi on being elected Speaker of the House and reclaiming the gavel. I can’t wait to continue working with my friend to fight to make life better for Americans across the country. #SpeakerPelosi RT @mikiebarb: On today’s Daily: I went to @SenSchumer’s office hours after he met with Trump to talk about The Wall, the shutdown, his par… After leaving the White House yesterday, I sat down with @MikieBarb to talk about why we told @realDonaldTrump that Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess with two bills to reopen government services.
 
Listen to The Daily: https://t.co/6SBlTWvbW5 RT @CNBC: "To use the shutdown as hostage... Is wrong," Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi speak outside the White House after a meeting with T… You know, this comic isn’t far off.

President @realDonaldTrump has dragged us into #TrumpShutdown Week 2 without offering any plan that can pass the House and Senate.

Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess with 2 bills to reopen government services. https://t.co/FVVOljnvz7 RT @schumersglasses: https://t.co/HX6oF94GRo I’m so proud I got to ring in 2019 with my grandson Noah. I’m going to spend it fighting for him, and all children and families. 

From my family to yours, happy New Year. https://t.co/1EY0EXJIYh From my family to yours, Happy New Year! I’m always so proud to see how everyone celebrates in Times Square, in New York, and across the country. We’re ready for the year ahead. Once the Senate passes this legislation and puts us on a path to reopening government, President @realDonaldTrump must come to his senses and immediately sign it into law. #TrumpShutdown It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they supported two weeks ago. #TrumpShutdown If @SenateMajLdr McConnell and Senate Republicans refuse to support the first bill, then they are complicit with President @realDonaldTrump in continuing the #TrumpShutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers’ paychecks hostage over the wall. The second bill would extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding through February 8th, which Republicans already supported in recent weeks. #TrumpShutdown The first bill would reopen all government agencies except for the Department of Homeland Security—not taking a position on the President’s wall. It would simply continue the funding levels and language that both parties have already supported. #TrumpShutdown The President is using the government shutdown to try and force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown. #TrumpShutdown The Democrats’ legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown reopens government services, ensures workers get the paychecks they’ve earned, and restores certainty to the lives of the American people. While President @realDonaldTrump drags the nation into Week Two of the #TrumpShutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess. https://t.co/velSjEBxyj President @realDonaldTrump claims he cares about federal workers one day, but then he freezes their pay the next.

Actions speak louder than words. Congrats to @CuseFootball on winning the Camping World Bowl. Ending the season 10-3 with a top 20 ranking. You did New York proud! Go Cuse! To everyone and every family celebrating in New York, America, and around the world, Merry Christmas. The President wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it. As long as the President is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it’s hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his #TrumpShutdown. Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the President would accept or not accept to end his #TrumpShutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment. Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, he’s continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts. It's Christmas Eve and President @realDonaldTrump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the President is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve—after he just fired the Secretary of Defense. Now he’s firing Mattis—a man who has spent a lifetime in public service—by January 1? 

What did Mattis say no to this time? https://t.co/rwGyF1nFS1 President @realDonaldTrump is calling respected diplomat Brett McGurk a grandstander? 

Oh, 𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦. https://t.co/x91EUZs9xQ At midnight last night, roughly twenty five percent of the government shut down because of one person and one person alone: President @realDonaldTrump.

We arrived at this moment because President Trump has been on a remarkable two-week temper tantrum. https://t.co/f69bgRxfep Regrettably, America has now entered a #TrumpShutdown. My statement with @NancyPelosi: https://t.co/Z2ZIbTY72W RT @ChrisVanHollen: On the Senate floor with @SenatorCardin to ask McConnell to bring our bill to guarantee back pay for furloughed federal… President Trump has thrown a temper tantrum and has us careening towards a Christmas #TrumpShutdown. He called for a shutdown no less than 25 times.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

We've offered 2 alternatives. @SenateMajLdr should consider them today.  https://t.co/juYDNRdYmg You own the shutdown—your own words, @realDonaldTrump. The Senate UNANIMOUSLY passed a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown. Then you threw another temper tantrum and convinced the House to ignore that compromise. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/h4R7Qk6E1i President Trump is plunging us into chaos.

The stock market is down 500 points. Secretary Mattis is leaving. We know he had serious disagreements with President Trump over Syria and the wall.

And now, another temper tantrum and a Trump shutdown over Christmas is nearly upon us. https://t.co/6rCQmEjSKd The Senate agreed to pass a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open. With 36 hours left to avoid a shutdown, the House must pass this continuing resolution and President Trump must sign it. https://t.co/sxa4bbUhqX Hey @realDonaldTrump, we were promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. 100%. https://t.co/tEtOdMeNDT Since Mr. Barr hasn’t been formally nominated yet, the president must immediately reconsider and find another nominee who is free of conflicts and will carry out the duties of the office impartially. The fact that he holds these deeply misguided views and chose to launch them in an unprovoked written attack on the Special Counsel unquestionably disqualifies Mr. Barr from serving as Attorney General again. Mr. Barr believes presidents in general—and more frighteningly, President Trump, who has shown less respect for rule of law than any president—are above the law. William Barr’s memo to the Department of Justice criticizing the Special Counsel investigation reveals that he is fatally conflicted from being able to oversee the Special Counsel’s investigation and he should not be nominated to be Attorney General. The American people know the president’s wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters—certainly not worth a government shutdown. It’s good that our Republican colleagues in the Senate finally realized that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country. RT @nytimes: “The presence of hate has become taken for granted,” says Steven Spielberg. “We are not doing enough to counter it.” https://t… BREAKING: Every member of the @SenateDems just told @realDonaldTrump to uphold the rule of law and defend health care protections for millions of Americans. https://t.co/ouOSPljwiB You're going to want to make sure your friends see this:

Senators Booker, Coons, and Flake just asked for the Senate's unanimous consent to pass a bill protecting the Mueller investigation from President Trump.

But they didn’t get it.

Because @SenateMajLdr McConnell objected. This morning, @realDonaldTrump also tweeted that Mexico could somehow pay for the wall through a new trade deal. 

Of course, there have been multiple fact checks that show a new NAFTA could not possibly fund a wall, directly or indirectly.  https://t.co/y5hQ1Mpgm1 The #FirstStepAct provides:

Judges more discretion in sentencing low-level nonviolent drug offenders

More support for programming to better prepare prisoners to return to society

Effective end to juvenile solitary confinement &amp; shackling pregnant prisoners https://t.co/KdRTkbbf1B The Senate will likely vote soon on the bipartisan #FirstStepAct.

I support this bill and intend to vote yes on final passage.

The bill makes smart changes to our criminal justice system to make it fairer, more humane, more just. https://t.co/FcQ8UfsKia Penny Marshall was a Bronx native. She made us all laugh. She made us all cry. She paved the way for so many women in television. And, she was in a league of her own.

We will miss you, Penny. Godspeed. THEN:
Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico. Mexico. Mexico.

NOW:
Who is going to pay for the wall? American taxpayers.
And if I don’t get $5 billion from them, I’m going to shut down the government.

President @realDonaldTrump, no temper tantrum is going to get you the wall. https://t.co/pK7pXcYwzk With only a few days to go, @realDonaldTrump needs to come out of hiding and accept one of our proposals to keep the government open.

If he throws a temper tantrum, he will not get a wall, but he will cause a #TrumpShutdown over Christmas. https://t.co/5TpFd0MfxA I’m so proud of my friend @CPeoplesStokes. She will now officially become the first African American woman to hold the title of Majority Leader in the New York State Assembly. I cannot wait to see all of her hard work on behalf of the caucus and New Yorkers. https://t.co/c9gFERIYVb
