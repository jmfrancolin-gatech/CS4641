Read this week’s Long’s Short Report about my work protecting innocent lives ➡️ https://t.co/eAsGIZWPwp #ProLife Had a great meeting with @marceloclaure, Executive Chairman of @sprint, this morning! With their headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas, they employ a lot of folks that live in #Missouri. https://t.co/l1HWjlRd3B "The Left really has only one idea: control." #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/i3wJq7ohqi Today, my colleague and good friend, @RepAnnWagner, asked for unanimous consent to bring up the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. But once again, my liberal colleagues rejected it. Like I've said before, this should NOT be a partisan issue. #ProLife It's absolutely appalling that Democrats refuse to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This should not be a partisan issue. #ProLife https://t.co/0LDDIPWfqm In the words of @SpeakerPelosi, it's the green dream. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/7zcjEut3cF Medicare for all is just another liberal idea that will cost hardworking Americans trillions of dollars. If Democrats think it's such a great plan, they should have no issue holding a hearing and answering the hard questions. https://t.co/jlmDbNKzQM Yes, yes we are. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/zaZevc7njO #GreenNewDeal highlights: 

➡️ Costs trillions of dollars 

➡️ Eliminates air travel 

➡️ Requires EVERY SINGLE building in the U.S. to be upgraded or replaced 

➡️ Provides economic security for those UNWILLING to work??

How is this a win for the American people? When the leader of your own party is throwing shade at your “green dream” you know you have problems #GreenNewDeal ⬇️ https://t.co/wihtkMHPoc .@TMobile folks came by today to talk Springfield Call Center improvements, 5G for all and investing in and closing the digital divide in rural communities in #MO7 https://t.co/oL49ttpU5i Enjoyed meeting with @CMHBolivar and @ruralhealth folks in my DC office this afternoon.
