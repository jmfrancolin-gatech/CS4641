We should all support diplomacy. But we can't be naive, gullible or weak.

North Korea HAS NOT:

-Eliminated a single nuclear weapon
-Eliminated a single missile
-Eliminated any chem weapons

North Korea HAS:

-Increased nuclear fuel output
-Hidden its missile bases

Have a nice day. https://t.co/Ikp0mASWzZ Tonight when the cameras show the House Floor during the #StateOfTheUnion, the American people will see the most diverse Congress in US history. 

And as the cameras focus in on @POTUS, sitting behind him looking down at him will be @SpeakerPelosi.

You are right there is no AUMF for Iran. Or Venezuela. Good question @sam_vinograd. One reason could be that Congress has authorized military operations in Iraq.

His medieval wall is so easily defeatable. https://t.co/FkDgJeTmCC This is what I was trying to say in my long-winded prior tweet condemning the @realDonaldTrump Administration for refusing to find kids they separated from parents, but @pattonoswalt says it much more succinctly. https://t.co/gXtWGdgWQ1 @RogueNASA Good point. 49 years ago our federal government sent a human being to the moon and brought him back.

-Congress passes bill without wall funding.
-Trump signs bill &amp; tells his base the Wall is being built (since #MAGA folks, other than @AnnCoulter, will believe anything Trump says).

Easy.

What does that mean? No more stupid hearings on Hillary's emails.

First hearing in @HouseJudiciary is on HR1. This legislation #ForThePeople protects voting rights, reforms campaign finance law &amp; prevents corruption. https://t.co/k3MkSTEpg7 Dems ran on health care, infrastructure &amp; rooting out corruption. Dems won.

This #TuesdayMorning, @RepAnnaEshoo @RepCicilline @RepLindaSanchez @RepRubenGallego &amp; I reintroduced the Public Trust Act to stop corruption.

#PromisesMadePromisesKept

https://t.co/aOPuRfKFz0 Thank you @realDonaldTrump. I had never heard of Cliff Sims. But based on your official statement below, I'm going to go buy his book.

#TuesdayMotivation https://t.co/BZLSI0Jb4Z Why hasn't @realDonaldTrump declared a "National Emergency" on the southern border yet? Because he knows he will lose in court. There is no emergency. Below are Trump's own words last year.

Even a conservative Supreme Court would not ignore actual facts.

#TuesdayThoughts https://t.co/JmO1wTliwY New Post-ABC poll shows public sentiment is against @realDonaldTrump, bigly. The middle option in the poll that most voters rejected was "would you consider" voting for Trump.

As the author states: "these numbers can’t be described as anything except bad" for @POTUS. https://t.co/QjlxfcwRnF Dear Acting AG @MattWhitaker46: See you on February 8 in the @HouseJudiciary Committee. 

In front of the American people. 

Under oath. https://t.co/mPL2pKljZm @Tom4CongressNY6 @KamalaHarris Um, did you watch the town hall? Kamala answered the questions with grace, substance and strength. If this was actually true, @realDonaldTrump would not have caved last week. https://t.co/2FA4D7kH6N @Ryan_VanSickle Thank you for reading my tweets. I never disclose what happens in internal Steering and Policy Committee discussions. But I make one exception today.

We just gave @SpeakerPelosi a standing ovation. Because Nancy Pelosi is a badass.

#NoMoreShutdowns No https://t.co/ZDQJztf4nT Why is AG Whitaker commenting on an ongoing investigation? This seems inappropriate.

What if Mueller finds additional leads and evidence from Roger Stone? 

@MattWhitaker46 should not be rushing Mueller. The investigation must be done right, without political interference. https://t.co/ONcYgxQ68y Tomorrow at 10 am PT @HouseJudiciary will hear HR1 by @RepSarbanes. This landmark bill #ForThePeople will protect voting rights; reform our campaign finance laws; and help stop corruption. 

Dems campaigned on anti-corruption last Nov. Now we deliver.

#PromisesMadePromisesKept Oh https://t.co/I1CjotMyYF RT @HuffPost: California Rep. Ted Lieu endorsed Kamala Harris, saying she "is the person we need to move America forward." https://t.co/w6b… RT @CNNPolitics: Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu endorses Kamala Harris' 2020 bid https://t.co/2QyR1S3Lvd https://t.co/CuGeNpK7k5 RT @thehill: Kamala Harris endorsed by Dem lawmaker one day after launching campaign: "She embraces the future" https://t.co/jri3iOvVSF htt… RT @FridaGhitis: Wow. Important early boost for @KamalaHarris. This is going to energize and accelerate the race https://t.co/TjVAB45sBQ RT @djrothkopf: This matters a lot to me.  @tedlieu is one of the very best.  And his support for @KamalaHarris is therefore really meaning… @chrisdonovan I just followed you even though you are a Patriots fan. I endorse @KamalaHarris for President. 

Known Kamala for many years &amp; worked together on various issues. She embraces the future, not the past, and is the person we need to move America forward.

Watch the #HarrisTownHall tonight at 7 pm PT / 10 pm ET to learn more about Kamala. https://t.co/P4ywl9U3Op Dear @realDonaldTrump: Mick Mulvaney said you are threatening to shut down the government again in 3 weeks if you don't get your way. You may want to read the report from the Congressional Budget Office, or get briefed on it.

There is no education in the second kick of the mule. https://t.co/E5hYdqNm13 Why hasn't @POTUS declared a national emergency?

1. The facts don't support it
2. Unconstitutional to bypass House
3. Future appropriations bills will explicitly say no wall funding

Even if Trump overcomes 1 &amp; 2, he can only build 1/9th of $60b wall this way.

#MondayThoughts https://t.co/OeWoeZw6hb RT @RubenGallego: .@tombrokaw I assimilated pretty well. https://t.co/8nDmzDxR7E Dear @realDonaldTrump: Under the United States Constitution, you don't get to decide if you can build your wall. Congress does. That's why you threw a temper tantrum and shut down government for 35 days. Remember? https://t.co/5wh6U0AW80 A rich businessman with no government experience has wrecked America as @POTUS the past 2 years. Howard Schultz thinks the solution is another rich businessman with no government experience.

Quoting McConnell again: There is no education in the second kick of the mule. https://t.co/olvuQhnNj8 Dear @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy: If you are going to lie, at least come up with more believable ones. We read and see the same statements by @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Administration that you do.

You disrespect the American people by treating us like we are stupid. We are not stupid. https://t.co/pQi4ZA2pVl Today is #HolocaustMemorialDay. We honor all the victims of the Holocaust killed by the Nazis. 

There are no words that can adequately depict the horror of what can happen when a government &amp; country lets hate get out of control. This harrowing video serves as a stark reminder. https://t.co/5aSchZU4dV Insane that Mick Mulvaney said this. The @realDonaldTrump Administration is THREATENING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AGAIN. 

No President should ever threaten harming Americans as a negotiating tactic. Ever.

Also, to quote McConnell: There is no education in the second kick of a mule https://t.co/DmSrqfgWEX If the below article is correct, it makes us ask the question:

Why would both Russia and @realDonaldTrump fear the Steele Dossier?

(Also, over time more and more parts of the Dossier have been corroborated).

#SundayThoughts https://t.co/AG8gbmEjqN MOST SUCCESSFUL WITCH HUNT IN US HISTORY 

MAYBE EVEN THE WORLD My weekly recommendations for Freshman Members of Congress to follow. Below all served in the Executive Branch:

@AndyKimNJ, National Security Council Official
