Thanks to all the elected officials &amp; community members who joined me today in calling on @epa to shut down Sterigenics. EPA knows we’re not backing down in our mission to protect the health of our citizens. https://t.co/3xInaaylez RT @SenatorDurbin: My statement with @SenDuckworth, @RepBillFoster, @RepLipinski, @RepSchneider, and @RepCasten on the latest with Sterigen… I’m saddened by the passing of Congressman John Dingell, a legendary statesman &amp; public servant. My deepest condolences to my friend &amp; colleague Debbie Dingell, his loving wife, &amp; the many Dingell staff alumni who worked for him over his illustrious, monumental &amp; historic career. https://t.co/lOaDADciIU Talked infrastructure w/ @morningsmaria before officially taking over as chair of the House Transpo &amp; Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines &amp; Hazmat. Look forward to working on bipartisan solutions to address our massive infrastructure investment needs. https://t.co/BgWt7fOiRZ I repeat. @epa, shut @sterigenics1 down now. https://t.co/TXznqLOPGy It’s time to open up the market for Rx drug prices. We need more pricing transparency to drive down the cost of Rx drugs for seniors &amp; families across America. I’m proud to co-sponsor legislation to allow Medicare to finally negotiate on behalf of Americans. #EndRxMonopolyPrices First panel of first House Transportation &amp; #Infrastructure Committee hearing. 2 of the witnesses are good friends, @GovTimWalz (MN) &amp; former US Transpo Sec. @RayLaHood. Both know how critical a big federal investment is to fix our transportation infrastructure #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/bOXcoLQ4mw First hearing of House Transportation Committee is called to order! Welcome new Committee Chair @RepPeterDeFazio. #infrastructure #TheCostofInaction https://t.co/V0vgPMrGIH I'll be on @MorningsMaria tomorrow discussing the #sotu, infrastructure, and other topics. Tune in to @foxbusiness at 8 a.m. ET. My call to shutdown @sterigenics1 was mentioned in this ABC7 story. We need to keep the pressure on @epa. I'm glad the chorus of state &amp; federal officials joining me calling for the shutdown is growing. The more data we see, the worse the situation looks. https://t.co/Gj1BmKW1fE "We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them." Let's hope the president and all in Washington together live and work by these words for the good of all the American people. It would be a welcome change. #sotu I appreciated the stories about Americans liberating Jewish prisoners from concentration camps. That is America at its best! #sotu My view from the gallery. #sotu https://t.co/N8olhL6sft On Thurs, the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee, which I serve on as Rail Subcommittee chairman, will hold a hearing on the cost of doing nothing and why investing in our trillion-dollar infrastructure backlog cannot wait. #sotu I appreciate #potus calling on Congress to produce an infrastructure package that invests in vital national projects. However, we need more than lip service. We need funding so we can ease congestion on roads, improve public transportation, &amp; fix crumbling infrastructure. #sotu Both parties in Congress SHOULD be working for effective, nonpartisan oversight and investigations. That hasn’t been happening, but that’s the way our government is supposed to work. Checks and balances. #sotu If only the president would follow his grandiose words with action working together for the American people. #sotu Hanging out in the House gallery with my #sotu guest CPD Officer Gino Garcia. Gino’s seat is on the aisle in the exact middle of the gallery directly facing the president. https://t.co/YjR88l3W3U Today’s @EPA data shows that the EtO levels around the Sterigenics facilities in Willowbrook are well over the EPA action threshold for cancer risk. One result was 350 times the threshold. It is time for EPA to immediately shut the facilities down. https://t.co/rIVL7ofp7Z My #SOTU guest tomorrow is @Chicago_Police officer Gino Garcia. Gino was 6 when domestic violence tragically ended his mother’s life. The experience made him the man he is today: an advocate for victims &amp; an upstanding public servant. #enddomesticviolence https://t.co/HXnp1frhNj I base this call on the air testing EPA has already conducted and made this clear to Sterigenics executives when we met last week. This story makes several allegations that, if confirmed, are incredibly disturbing. I will continue to hold @Sterigenics1 accountable and will not relent in calling for the @EPA to shut down the plant unless they can prove that it is not a health threat. https://t.co/BlKyWN2lWW @AlexParker I’ve reached out to Metra for an explanation. Like you, I am beyond frustrated. Watching the big game at St. James at Sag Bridge in Lemont.

That’s why I’m proud to again co-sponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act. #EqualPay https://t.co/jOcB8y8Fr7 The only way I’ll back off calling for an EPA shut down is if such testing is conducted and it backs their claim.  They have not moved forward on this. Today I reiterated this. 4 of 4 Six weeks ago I told Sterigenics they should begin perimeter testing as the only way to prove their claim they are not emitting a significant amount of EtO into the community. 3 of 4 . @epa has not heeded my request to shut down Sterigenics based on EPA air tests that indicated high level of ethylene oxide in Willowbrook. 2 of 4 Today I met w @Sterigenics1’s CEO &amp; president &amp; requested that they host a public meeting w/ impacted residents ASAP. They did not indicate a willingness to do so at this time. 1 of 4 https://t.co/X51pXMof9u I signed on to cosponsor legislation to enact an automatic continuing resolution at the previous year’s funding levels in the event Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. No more shutdowns. Federal employees and their families deserve better. https://t.co/ai0wzHUVAD @LOYURGRL @N4EJchicago @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL I completely understand. I should have provided more context in my original tweet. I am very sorry for what everyone who lives near Sterigenics has been going through and can assure you I am on your side. Sterigenics continues to make the claim that the high EtO readings in Willowbrook are not caused by their plants. That’s why I challenged Sterigenics to back up their claim with real data that could come from perimeter testing. So far they’ve done nothing. @mr_sj_stanczak @Sterigenics1 Give us the data to convince EPA to shut it down @N4EJchicago @LOYURGRL @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL Please see my clarifying response to initial tweet. I will provide more info after today’s meeting @jen_mcconahy @Sterigenics1 @EPA @CleanAirIL @StopSterigenics @StopEtOLC Still calling for the shutdown. See my clarifying response to initial tweet Perimeter testing could provide even more evidence that Sterigenics is not safe, and perhaps finally convince EPA to shut it down. That is why I’m calling for it. I want to clarify that my call for Sterigenics to test the air around their perimeter does not change my position that they need to shut down unless and until they can demonstrate that they are safe. Seeing lots of ‘dibs’ around the district tonight. Where do we stand on dibs? Pro or con? I’m a sweat equity guy so I lean pro dibs. Sound off ⬇️. No judgment here. https://t.co/8o2DDpdWTp Tomorrow during meeting w/ @Sterigenics1’s CEO I’ll be calling on him to implement perimeter air quality monitoring so we can have a better sense of how much EtO is coming out of Willowbrook plants. This is something I asked for weeks ago &amp; they’ve dragged their feet. Time to act https://t.co/0cSyBFOr68 How cool was this! Congrats to Palos Park native and @SandburgHS alum Kendall Coyne Schofield for killing it at the the NHL All Star Skills Competition.

My colleagues &amp; I in the House have voted 9 times to reopen government &amp; end the shutdown. Our communities demand action. @senatemajldr must act now. https://t.co/us7qfy9roM Voted w/ 362 of my House colleagues yesterday to disapprove lifting sanctions on companies connected with Putin cronies.

I continue to be a strong voice for climate leadership in Congress today, pursuing multi efforts to enact bipartisan legislation, including cosponsoring the Energy Innovation Carbon Dividend Act I agree with 45 leading economists, former fed chairs, &amp; cabinet secretaries that climate change is a serious problem &amp; a carbon fee is the most cost-effective way to address it w/ necessary speed &amp; scale. https://t.co/YLxwyjfZ1i The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act I worked on w/ @RepWebster, @RepEBJ, &amp; @RepFrankLucas has been reintroduced.

I encourage residents of #IL03 impacted by the shutdown to share your stories on https://t.co/B7MgOq0BSw. Make your voice heard. Proud to join my House colleagues in support of @whipclyburn’s H. Res. 41 denouncing Rep. King’s remarks &amp; rejecting white nationalism &amp; supremacy. Rep.

Another way the shutdown is impacting our health, safety, and welfare. We must re-open govt. Glad to cosponsor HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, a bill requiring a background check to buy a gun. Common-sense policy supported by 85% of Americans &amp; something I've long advocated. Just makes sense to deny weapons to domestic abusers &amp; those with criminal history Border security is critical, but @POTUS failed to make case last night that govt should be shut down over the fight for $5.7 billion for wall which would not impact most of border issues he talked about 2/2 The govt #shutdown is having real-world impacts not just on federal employees but the many who depend on services. Ridiculous that we are on path towards longest shutdown ever 1/2 A TX judge struck down the entire #ACA &amp; @POTUS is failing to defend the law in court. I voted today in favor of House of Reps defending the ACA in court so we can maintain coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions &amp; rein in insurers Here's an interview I did last month about the rules changes my colleagues &amp; I in the Problems Solvers Caucus fought for to break the gridlock in #DC.

I look forward to working in the new Democratic House majority to make life better for my constituents &amp; all Americans, especially middle class families &amp; seniors. https://t.co/cPb6VKvgCF The model should also be considered for all drug purchases through Medicare.  I am hopeful that the new Democratic House majority will make progress in reining in sky-high prescription drug prices for all Americans. This law would require the government to negotiate w drug manufacturers for lower prices. I also support Medicare's move to institute the IPI Model to lower costs for MD-administered drugs by resetting Medicare payments based on international prices and introducing competition. An article in today’s WSJ shows that price increases on prescription drugs, including generics, continue to outpace inflation. That’s why I continue to fight for lower drug prices. In the new Congress I will help introduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act https://t.co/i2OSsjoYLP Happy New Year! Wishing everyone a healthy and prosperous 2019.

I continue to stand by my statement that Sterigenics should close until we’re assured it’s not a public health threat. Because EPA won't shut Sterigenics (which they have the authority to do), &amp; because the company won't shut itself down, I'm calling for new EtO testing methods We learned from today's @EPA webinar that new results for EtO testing conducted on 11/23 in Willowbrook differ from previous results, but only raise more questions &amp; cannot be said to demonstrate that @Sterigenics1 is not a public health threat. https://t.co/L3JV4SrFtR Please take a moment today to honor @chicago_police officers Conrad Gary and Eduardo Marmolejo, who lost their lives in the line of duty in a tragic train accident. The officers’ heroic actions pursuing an armed suspect cost them their lives. My condolences to their families. RIP The @EPA is hosting a webinar tomorrow at 1 p.m. CST to share the latest info on EtO monitoring at @Sterigenics1 in Willowbrook. As I work to protect public health and safety, I’ll continue to provide updates.  https://t.co/zDuLl8DqS0 The #ACA needs to be improved, not eliminated. I will continue to work in this new Congress to give Americans better access to affordable health care. Congress must act to counter the judicial elimination of the #ACA.

I’ve cosponsored legislation so the House can defend the ACA in court appeals since #POTUS refused to do so.

Bush is eulogized today, we remember a man who demonstrated dignity and respect for others in life and in death. I hope this inspires more Americans, especially those in public life, to live the same way. #NationalDayOfMourning #Remebering41 https://t.co/uiRhskDixz I rode @metraBNSF in to today’s Restoring Illinois’ Infrastructure Committee meeting. The committee is focused on IL transportation issues of all forms, including problems on Metra lines. Learn more at the meeting I’m hosting w @Metra &amp; @BNSFRailway Monday, 7pm at McClure Jr High https://t.co/WQOqL8ZoJ0 Illinois’ infrastructure is in desperate need of improvements &amp; I look forward to utilizing my experience as the senior IL member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to help rebuild our state and create jobs. https://t.co/Maf4goD4dM I’m honored to be a co-chair on Governor-elect @JBPritzker’s &amp; Lieutenant Governor-elect @JulianaforLG’s Restoring Illinois Infrastructure Committee. #twill https://t.co/iHiJ2ONGFD Happy 200th Birthday Illinois! History buffs will like the historical Land of Lincoln maps available online at The Library of Congress. There are commercial maps, topographical maps &amp; more covering our state’s rich history. See them: https://t.co/fthf51pd50 #Illinoisbicentennial Very sorry to hear about the passing of President George H.W. Bush, a student-athlete, WWII pilot, intelligence chief, diplomat, statesman, and true original. He lived life to the fullest. RIP #Bush41 10 gigatons of CO2 are emitted each year - a rate unseen in the last 50 million years. Congress must act on climate change before it’s too late. Here’s a look at the potential impact on IL if nothing is done. #ClimateFriday https://t.co/kz96bnYvX9 ...He’s just looking to #BreaktheGridlock and wants elected officials who support good policy, not just a party. That's exactly what we're doing with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. https://t.co/7X8G1a4vGs On today's Slocum In The Morning show on @WJOL, I talked about my recent op-ed in the @DVNNews, where I describe a chat I had at my favorite local brewery with a voter who said he voted for Obama, Trump, &amp; recently for Dems... ICYMI: Had a great time on the @CochranShow yesterday talking about House rules reforms, infrastructure, and the upcoming 116th Congress. My segment begins at the 31:45 mark. https://t.co/Qo6YX2Bp6U Proud of the concessions the Problem Solvers Caucus got from Leader Pelosi to move forward on reforming House rules and breaking the gridlock in DC. For the first time in decades, power is shifting to individual members of Congress. https://t.co/cEsfTVTt4O I’m glad to help shed light on @EPA’s misguided decision years ago to relax clean air regulations. @RepSchneider @RepBillFoster @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth &amp; I introduced legislation this week to address this problem. https://t.co/NugCkgeJKP REMINDER: @epa is hosting an open house &amp; community forum today on EtO and @Sterigenics1 at Ashton Place Banquets in Willowbrook. Open house goes from 3-6 &amp; forum goes from 7-10. Email questions in advance to eto@epa.gov. I plan to attend &amp; offer remarks. https://t.co/topr3CcvNj I’ll be talking more about this tomorrow on the @CochranShow on @WGNRadio at 7 a.m. @NoLabelsOrg 

https://t.co/9iHK3UdhRb Today, members of Problem Solvers Caucus &amp; I announced an agreement was reached w Democratic Leaders to accept some of the House rules reforms we’ve been pursuing in our #BreakTheGridlock proposal. While we didn’t get all that we asked for, I’m pleased to be able to make progress “Congress has really lost, unfortunately, a lot of the ability that we have to get good information, good advice when making policy.” I provided some insight for @OswaldRachel's must-read CQ Mag story about how Congress has lost its capacity to push through complex legislation. https://t.co/o0Fzaf1ZZR Today I met with officials from @metra &amp; @BNSFRailway to discuss service disruptions &amp; delays on the @metraBNSF line. They’ll be available to answer your questions at a public meeting I’m hosting Monday, 12/10 at 7 pm at McClure Jr High in Western Springs.

The proposals I outlined in this @chicagotribune op-ed work toward that goal https://t.co/N9z47Z6EtQ Great win by @Nazarethlgp in the 7A title game! Congrats on getting it done after coming so close last year. High schools in my district are 2 for 2 in today’s championships. One more to go! #IHSAfootball Congratulations to the 2018 5A State Champs Joliet Catholic Hilltoppers! Job well done! @JCAonline #IHSAfootball https://t.co/NocC1UmifC Please take time out today to support your neighborhood small businesses on #SmallBusinessSaturday. I’m grateful for all the small business owners in my district who create jobs and boost the economy. https://t.co/WnWqXWqxbS #shopsmall https://t.co/YZoi1q1ccZ The #NCA4 report released today is a sobering account of drastic repercussions we likely face if we don’t immediately address global climate change. It highlights the devastating impact on health &amp; the economy we can expect if we do nothing. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/qi7xKCPXz3 I signed a statement today w/ 8 other Dem members of the #ProblemSolversCaucus re: how we won’t be supporting Nancy Pelosi for Speaker until we get a commitment to change some House rules and #BreakTheGridlock in DC. All we’re asking for is a commitment to common sense governing https://t.co/YEel7XPSmS Happy Thanksgiving! My wife &amp; I had a great time today at the @pilgrimpierun in La Grange. We hope you have a wonderful holiday with your friends and family. https://t.co/hXrFowrnAZ I introduced legislation this week that would force the @EPA to update EtO emissions standards to conform with the current science showing EtO is much more dangerous than used to be understood. Details are available on my website. https://t.co/2wiXXcN9Rg #SayNoToEto The rules of the House are rigged in a way that makes legislating a top-down process. The next Speaker must agree to rules changes that restore the 'People's House' and restore power to the American people. I discussed this last week on @WGNTV. https://t.co/o9izmDhHhL https://t.co/PZyrA5Dbo4 RT @MaryAnnAhernNBC: Procession underway for 28 year old ChIcago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez #CPD https://t.co/Njy40NflEG https://t.co/TaabMoacZE I'm deeply saddened by the news of today’s tragic shootings at #MercyHospital. My heart goes out the victims - a doctor, a pharmacy assistant &amp; Chicago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez, who was killed in the line of duty. Please keep the victims &amp; their families in your prayers. Congrats to Champaign-bound Joliet Catholic for an impressive win over top seed Hillcrest in the #IHSA 5A semis. To be playing for the championship as a 14 seed is remarkable. Go @HilltoppersFB! @JCAonline Great win for Coach Racki and the Nazareth Roadrunners on Saturday over Batavia. I’ll be rooting for you in the 7A finals! #IHSA @FootballNaz Congrats to undefeated @BrotherRice on their hard-fought win over Marist in the #IHSA 8A semis. The Crusaders ran the table in arguably the state’s toughest division - an impressive feat. Good luck in the finals this weekend. Bring home the title! @Rice_Pride RT @NazBCast: The Roadrunners are going back to the state championship! See you next Saturday on Champaign!!! https://t.co/XphX4DU8C8 The Endangered Species Act says science, not politics, must guide decisions on protecting vulnerable species. That's why I voted against the Manage our Wolves Act, which would remove gray wolves from the endangered species list in the lower 48. #HR6784 https://t.co/08qumx95ol I will be introducing legislation to address this and will continue to hold both @Sterigenics1 and @EPA's feet to the fire. 2 of 2. Thanks to the @chicagotribune editorial board for recognizing the work I've been doing to hold @EPA accountable for not updating clean air standards at commercial sterilizer facilities like @Sterigenics1. 1 of 2 https://t.co/3m8xQl2r7g Enjoyed taking some time out tonight in DC to speak with a group of political science students from @Pepperdine University, including a constituent, Colin Kubacki, from Western Springs. I always love talking to students and remembering my days teaching American Government. https://t.co/UbB4xJsI1o I told the @BNSFRailway VP and @metra that they need to hold a public meeting so they can hear firsthand from frustrated commuters and explain how they will fix the delays. Both RRs must be accountable to passengers. Stay tuned for details. 2 of 2. In a follow-up to Tuesday's problems on @metraBNSF line, I had a call yesterday with @BNSFRailway's VP of Passenger Operations to tell him the continued failure to provide on-time rail service to @metra riders must end. I have already called in the federal regulator. 1 of 2 I’ve made it clear for several months now that the next speaker must support the House rules reforms endorsed  by my colleagues and I in the Problems Solvers Caucus. We need to fix the rigged rules to #breakthegridlock  @NoLabelsOrg https://t.co/5cMfYjQaXT War Powers Resolution of 1973 checked the President’s power to commit the US to armed conflicts. House leaders’ actions today undermine the rule of law and Congressional oversight. I voted against this ploy &amp; demand debate on this critical issue. #HConRes138 #YemenCantWait (2 of 2)Testing started yesterday and will continue for three months. For more details, visit https://t.co/vqbydMQGDn. However, more must be done. I’m awaiting further regulatory action from @epa and working on separate legislation. .@epa just announced its plan for conducting air testing for carcinogenic ethylene oxide around the @Sterigenics1 facility in Willowbrook, as I have demanded for months. This is an important first step toward letting residents know whether the air they breathe is safe. (1 of 2) Congress should not give up its powers to any President. Individual representatives should not give up their powers to congressional leadership. The House is scheduled to do that today on Yemen and the War Powers Resolution of 1973.  #HConRes138 #YemenCantWait House Republican leaders today are using a procedural trick to prevent a debate on whether the US should be involved in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is wrong. Congress should debate H.Con.Res. 138 as required by the War Powers Resolution of 1973. #HConRes138 #YemenCantWait I’m proud to be part of a group of Dems working to enact House rules changes to break the gridlock in Washington. As I said in July, rules are rigged in a way that diminishes the ability of reps to represent our constituents. The American people deserve better. @NoLabelsOrg https://t.co/UZYwFYxmxu RT @healthylakes: .@RepLipinski thanks for signing on to support #GLRI at $300M in FY20! The letter asks the Office of Management and Budge… It's appalling &amp; dangerous that it's been 12 years since emissions standards for hazardous pollutants like ETO have been updated for sterilization facilities like @Sterigenics1. The Clean Air Act requires these standards to be updated every 8 years. @EPA needs to take action now. https://t.co/3Q3m2soqqv @AmyRutledgeWGN @BNSFRailway @Metra @metraBNSF 2 of 2 Glad to know Gov-elect Pritzker has made this a priority right out of the gate. @JBPritzker @irtba @acecillinois @ilchamber @tficillinois @AmyRutledgeWGN @BNSFRailway @Metra @metraBNSF 1 of 2 This problem with Metra and BNSF is a management, accountability, and funding issue. That’s why I’ve gotten the Surface Transportation Board - the federal railroad regulator - involved. Transportation is underfunded and that’s why a state capital bill is sorely needed. .@BNSFRailway &amp; @metra need to figure out these continued service delays. Yes, we're Chicagoans &amp; can handle some cold weather (thought we shouldn't have to), but we absolutely can't be 75 minutes late to work. This is a pattern with BNSF &amp; Metra and it has to stop. @metraBNSF https://t.co/w3eIK6A5w8 I'm accepting nomination request letters from young women and men in the district who want to enter one of the U.S. Service Academies in 2019 until November 26.
