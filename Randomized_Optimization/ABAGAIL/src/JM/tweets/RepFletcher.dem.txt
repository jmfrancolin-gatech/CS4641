Houston Police Chief @ArtAcevedo is a force of nature &amp; incredible advocate.  I'm so glad to have this Houston representative in Washington this week to speak to Congress about preventing gun violence. https://t.co/dLFKNms12H Investing in clean water infrastructure should not be controversial. For every $1 billion invested in America’s water infrastructure, 27,000 jobs are created or sustained while improving public health and the environment—all at the same time. #TheCostOfInaction Houston's legacy of exploration is best exemplified by the people who have set a course for outer space, to learn more about the universe and our place in it. Today, #NASARemembers, and we honor the sacrifice of those astronauts who lost their lives in this pursuit. https://t.co/9R2Fu0YM3w It is critical that we get the funding Congress approved to rebuild more resilient infrastructure after #Harvey. That’s why @RepPeteOlson &amp; I &amp; our colleagues wrote to OMB asking to finalize the rules and release the funds. Our future depends on it.

https://t.co/RJ4QNHVcg6 https://t.co/1JaTdZIBNb America’s infrastructure was once the envy of the world, but today it is losing its battle against time, growth, and a changing climate. We need to take a bold and new approach that includes tackling these issues head-on and developing real solutions. #TheCostOfInaction This morning, my colleagues and I on the @TransportDems will be hearing from experts on infrastructure and the urgency to address our nation's necessary repairs and upgrades. You can watch it live here: https://t.co/Rvc3IzAftv Another look at priorities of this fabulous freshman class. So much to work on together, and so much energy to do so. https://t.co/ZspCDDf00F All the women in white remind me of Ann Richards, when asked what she would have done differently in her term, said, “I would probably have raised more hell.” With more than 100 women in the House, you can be sure we’re taking her advice—and thanking the women who came before us. https://t.co/s1dLrud33e To all those in our community who are celebrating, Happy #LunarNewYear! 春节快乐! 恭喜发财！ https://t.co/SfodbKIAlk What a privilege to meet with #TX07 constituents in Washington &amp; Houston about issues that matter &amp; solutions that might help. Thanks to those who have made time to share their thoughts with me recently on issues that affect our community. https://t.co/2LgFzUmPw3 Recognize that chair? My first time there—serving as Speaker Pro Tempore during debate on the House floor—is definitely the highlight of the last week. https://t.co/9SIYTCJqqs @RepPeteOlson @GovAbbott @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz The American people showed up to help us through Congress, directing more than $4 billion to our recovery alone, now we need the money to show up. Today, @RepPeteOlson and I led @GovAbbott, Senator @JohnCornyn &amp; @SenTedCruz, and our Houston colleagues in a letter to the OMB asking them to release the disaster recovery funds we need to rebuild after #Harvey. https://t.co/TNPKGe3Ukz https://t.co/kOJ7dGUDFH RT @HoustonPubMedia: .@RepFletcher wants to use her new seat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to back @METROHouston… Today is the birthday of #RosaParks, a woman who faced discrimination with courage and determination, and inspired Americans with her bravery. It is on us all to follow her example to speak out against injustice and fight for equality. We still have work to do. https://t.co/KnBgB3OhiF I'll be live on @HoustonMatters today, so tune in at 12:15PM to 88.7FM (or listen to the show's rebroadcast at 7PM). Looking forward to checking back in with the team at @HoustonPubMedia for the first time since being sworn in! As we begin to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, the @nytimes has published an incredible series of profiles of African Americans who have shaped our history. Their stories are vital to understanding who we are today. See them here: https://t.co/AQF4LWVYW6 Glad to have Rhonda Hart as my guest at next week's State of the Union. Her daughter Kimberly was a victim of the shooting at SFHS last year. She fights for gun violence prevention, and I'm proud to bring that fight to Washington. https://t.co/bF0GH0g4Qp I'm excited to join my @HouseNewDems colleagues, @RepRonKind, @RepRickLarsen and @RepGregoryMeeks on the Trade Task Force to find common sense solutions to some of our country's most pressing challenges. https://t.co/Ju7RYL80XP Ready to work #forthepeople on some of the most pressing challenges of our time. https://t.co/3ccgwY07xB Had a great meeting today with Senator @JohnCornyn.  Appreciate the warm welcome to the Texas delegation and the conversation about working together and finding common ground. https://t.co/VPV0lu4wyY The House has passed the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act today, recognizing the much-needed pay raise for the hardworking public servants who deserve our appreciation and respect. https://t.co/sb4eOprG2t The @Lilly_Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law 10 years ago. Yet a woman is still, on average, paid 80 cents to a man’s dollar. I am proud to join my colleagues in co-sponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act to close the gap. #EqualPay for equal work. https://t.co/fTlh9XXwAh We have many federal civil servants in our community, more than 3,000 of them working at @NASA_Johnson. As the representative for our community, I want to make sure they are all included and recognized for their valuable work. Thanks to my colleagues for passing my amendment to the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act to ensure that employees at @NASA are included equally in this bill. https://t.co/KmoyIWhI5b My thoughts are with our brave law enforcement officers who were injured tonight in Houston. Thank you for protecting our community. Houston stands with you. https://t.co/Ctceuz7K05 I’m glad to see the President agree to end the shutdown.  We’ve got a lot of ideas to improve border security, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the House to do so while keeping the government funded and functioning.
https://t.co/oD6PqzNs4j Thanks for coming to our office, @RepJenniffer. Looking forward to working together! https://t.co/sQ5yVZI4db I loved meeting with the students from Katy who came to Washington with @CloseUp_DC. We talked about what a member of Congress does each day and today's vote to re-open the government. https://t.co/58PkHeI5yP I represent a district that believes in science, innovation, and facts.  I am honored to serve on a committee that is dedicated to advancing progress in those critical areas https://t.co/W5qy0YVmAp 46 years ago today, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling that further recognized the fundamental right to privacy and autonomy that is essential to women’s equality: #RoeVWade. It is essential that we do all we can to protect this right, and I remain committed to doing so. https://t.co/kHXa0exuyt This week the House will vote to re-open the government for a 10th time. Now it's the Senate's job to take up this bill so we can open the government and address smart border security &amp; immigration solutions. We cannot shut down the government in order to govern. #EndtheShutdown It was wonderful to participate in today’s parade in honor of Dr. King, as Houstonians march in unity and hope. And it is a particular joy to follow Grand Marshall @RepJohnLewis who inspires me every day with his wisdom, his courage, his commitment, &amp; his belief in this country. https://t.co/XzieE2LMri There is much work to be done.  And we can do it together.  As Dr. King said, “the time is always right to do what is right.” Today, we remember &amp; honor Dr. Martin Luther King for his belief in an America as good as its promise for all Americans, and his courage to make it so. As we reflect on his life, we have the opportunity to reflect on what we can do right now to ensure equality &amp; justice for all. Loved welcoming my first @CloseUp_DC group from #TX07’s Episcopal High School. It brought back memories of my own Close Up trip back in 1991, when I visited my then Congressman who represented what is now part of #TX07. https://t.co/feuUrc9bd8 This is my first year to watch #houmarathon from the finish line.  What a sight!  Congratulations to all the runners — those who crossed this finish line, and all who took on the challenge.  My hat is off to y’all. @HoustonMarathon. https://t.co/FdjVdl7ENG When I lived on University Blvd years ago, the #HouMarathon course went right past my front door.  Glad to be back on University to cheer on the runners.  Thank you Mayor Sample for inviting me to watch from West U City Hall! https://t.co/IFJkrxv9E4 Each January, I look forward to waking up early on this day and heading out to cheer on the #houmarathon runners.  I am so inspired by the diverse group of people of all ages who make the commitment to run these 26.2 miles. @HoustonMarathon https://t.co/2g9IezwUFS It is time to discuss these matters with the seriousness they deserve. Time to #endtheshutdown and get to work #forthepeople. Democrats have made clear we support smart, effective border security solutions: increased infrastructure investments, advanced technology to scan for contraband, more customs personnel, and more immigration judges. There is much to discuss on border security matters but this is not the way to do it. We cannot run our government by shutting it down.  And we cannot protect our country by hurting the very people who have made it their life’s work to work for us. The President’s statement today was truly a disappointment. There was nothing new, and no compromise, just another attempt to pit people in difficult situations against one another. That’s not a solution. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from local @AFGE leaders in Houston today about the real world impact of this shutdown for those working in our airports, prisons, @NASA_Johnson, &amp; elsewhere.  It’s time to #callthevote and #endtheshutdown. https://t.co/B3k8j8q2ty Thank you to @womensmarchHOU organizers and the awesome women who marched to City Hall today.  Amazing energy and commitment to make women’s voices heard.  We will keep making them heard in D.C. https://t.co/8sN7SWDIPr Meeting with @TXDOT was especially useful as I prepare for Committee work with @TransportDems. Bad—but not surprising—news: Texas’ most congested freeway is in #TX07. Good news: They’re working on it! https://t.co/GFFU3NU7v9 It is a privilege and a pleasure to represent #TX07 in Congress.  I was delighted to visit with so many constituents in D.C. this week about important issues. https://t.co/MxaT5NCeLN So glad to be a part of this groundbreaking freshman class. https://t.co/QCI31gOqeF Thank you! Excited and ready to work together on the committee's important work. https://t.co/byv3AfZLrZ Service members and their families sacrifice every day for our freedoms. Today, we remember the four Americans servicemen who were senselessly murdered yesterday in Syria. We are indebted to them and their families for their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/VtzYSGMo4R I joined with my Texas colleagues in a bi-partisan letter expressing our strong opposition to any proposal that would divert disaster relief funds appropriated after Harvey and use them for any other purpose. https://t.co/gJMbxIEvdo This Congress will not allow the President to grant himself extraordinary powers to divert desperately needed funding for relief, recovery, and rebuilding. I will continue to fight for the additional resources that our region needs to rebuild and restore after Harvey. All Americans impacted by these natural disasters deserve to know that their government will be with them now and throughout the road to recovery. Today, I joined my colleagues to pass a $12.4 billion disaster relief bill to provide recovery funds for Americans devastated by hurricanes, wildfires, &amp; other disasters, including some for us in Houston as we continue to recover from Harvey. I am so inspired by my colleagues, and love how this series captures the women of the 116th Congress.  These photos are incredible.   These women are, too. https://t.co/HOy1qZpYNH I want to hear from you about how the shutdown is affecting you.  Share your shutdown story here. And these are just a few examples of the many heartbreaking stories we are seeing and hearing across the country.  I’m glad they took the time to talk with me. I spoke with people with cases in court that are now delayed, and justice denied indefinitely. I talked with TSA agents working hard and without pay – putting their neighbors’ needs ahead of their own. I met with air traffic controllers in Washington and Houston to hear the impacts this shutdown has on them – now and in the future. https://t.co/slsnVkXFU6 One of the best ways to know how to do that is to hear from you. But I do.  And I will work with my colleagues to end the shutdown and mitigate the damage in #TX07 and across the country – and we are already working on ways to do that. The impacts of this shutdown are real, and lasting. And it appears that the Senate and the White House do not care. There may be reasons, but they are not good reasons.  They are political reasons.  They are partisan reasons.  They are exactly the reasons I and so many others sought to join this Congress and do things differently. Since then, we have continued to act to re-open government, passing multiple individual Senate Republican appropriations bills to re-open all government agencies. There is no good reason that the Senate has not done the same. And, to be clear, the new Democratic House passed Senate Republican legislation to end the shutdown, re-open government and secure our borders the day we were sworn in. The House has passed the legislation to re-open the government.  It is past time for the Senate to do the same. Today, for the 26th day in a row, they are doing so without pay.  This is unconscionable. I came to Washington to work #forthepeople, and am grateful for the federal government employees who spend their days working for the people in myriad ways every single day. At @iah today and grateful for the @TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and others who put the rest of us and our safety first. We must do the same for them. It's time to #EndTheShutdown. My office is aware of the situation and working to help. I will keep you updated. https://t.co/iVNdxRUtIv As I told the @HoustonChron, the mere suggestion of diverting disaster relief funding is unacceptable. I am working with colleagues across Texas and across the aisle to make sure that doesn’t happen.

https://t.co/63wgTrJyig It remains the mission of the majority of the House to reopen the government, and we will keep passing legislation this week to do exactly that — and keep working for the people. On day one of this new Congress, the House passed Republican bills to end the shutdown and reopen government – meeting the needs of the American people, protecting our borders, and respecting our workers. I came to Congress to work #forthepeople of #TX07 and the United States. I was honored to join my colleagues for the announcement of #HR1, and appreciate the leadership of @RepSarbanes and @HouseDemocrats in bringing us together on these important reforms. https://t.co/iJHZDSfIxI I am proud to co-sponsor #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, as my first co-sponsored bill in Congress. It is a bold set of reforms to make sure that our government is of, by, and for the people. Ready to work #forthepeople. https://t.co/lpwK1R7a01 You can find us here https://t.co/hDzlGoAkaa. Our doors are open.  Come see us today until 2, or any day, at 1429 Longworth. Y'all are welcome here. #TX07 https://t.co/HWtw0brKsn Honored, grateful, &amp; proud to represent #TX07 in the 116th Congress.
