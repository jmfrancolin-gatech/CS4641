Our future success as a nation depends on ensuring all our students can receive a quality education. #HBCUs across the country share that goal, &amp; I'm proud to join @SenatorTimScott in intro'ing a bill to support this critical mission.

https://t.co/ofSirxCnuP As former Sen. Weicker says, “It isn’t enough for the special counsel to complete his investigation and then have his report buried in a drawer at the Justice Department, or censored by those appointed by the subject of the investigation.” I am grateful to @LindseyGrahamSC @SenThomTillis and @CoryBooker for working together with me on the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, which would ensure that the Special Counsel’s report goes to Congress. A must-read op-ed from former Republican Senator Lowell Weicker, who served on the Senate Watergate Committee. His words from 1973 are just as timely today: “The gut question for the committee and country alike is and was how much truth do we want?”

https://t.co/kGdq3BR6lR The #GlobalGagRule limits efforts to reduce maternal deaths, combat diseases like Zika &amp; provide life-saving HIV treatment. Limiting the care foreign NGOs can offer threatens women’s health around the world. The #GlobalGagRule unacceptably compromises the health and safety of women around the world. That’s why I’m cosponsoring legislation with @SenatorShaheen, @LisaMurkowski and @NitaLowey to permanently repeal it. Ok @JohnCarneyDE I’m impressed (cc @TheStateNews) https://t.co/DaeX6yP9Di And sometimes, even when it's difficult, it means joining hands in prayer or reflection to remind ourselves that as public servants, we share the same obligations to do what's best for the country we all love. Sometimes, it means fighting with everything I've got to stop the President or the Administration from doing something I believe is wrong. Sometimes, that means working together on bipartisan legislation. Look, I know that many Delawareans dislike and disagree with the President and that many others support him passionately. My commitment - and my prayer - is to try my best each day to work with Democrats, Republicans, &amp; the President to get things done for the people we represent In front of thousands of people at the event and many more watching at home, I prayed that God would grant President Trump wisdom, grace, and peace I don’t have 1000 words for this photo (credit to @AP photographer @evanvucci) but I do have some.

At a time when Washington &amp; our nation are deeply divided, this event is an opportunity to set aside political differences &amp; unite around our shared values. I believe it is my responsibility to protect the Special Counsel investigation and to safeguard the rule of law, &amp; I'm not convinced that Mr. Barr will uphold the AG's important role in ensuring the integrity of our democratic institutions. My statement: https://t.co/wnRboKyzp3 However, on other issues, he failed to give simple, clear commitments—that he would follow the guidance of career DOJ ethics officials on whether he should recuse himself from the investigation, defer to Special Counsel Mueller’s investigative decisions, or make the report public At his nomination hearing, I sought assurances from Mr. Barr that he would give the Special Counsel’s investigation the independence &amp; separation from politics that it deserves. I was glad to hear that he would not fire Mueller without cause &amp; would resign rather than do so.

So, that’s what I’m going to continue to focus on: finding real, achievable, bipartisan solutions to the challenges we all face as a country, because we have to solve them *together* I believe there are people of good will on both sides of the aisle who want to get things done, from rebuilding our roads and bridges to reducing health care costs and more. I was disappointed that the President dedicated most of his time during #SOTU last night to a few very divisive issues. He did make a number of intriguing proposals, but offered absolutely no details for turning them into a reality. RT @1a: Tune in now for our interview with @SenatorLankford and @ChrisCoons.

I helped lead a bipartisan effort in the Senate to urge President Trump to re-open the government for three weeks and allow Congress to debate appropriate border security and immigration policies. I’m encouraged the President has realized he cannot get what he wants by recklessly shutting down the government. For the last 35 days, Americans have faced increasing threats to our health and safety and federal employees have endured significant hardships simply because Pres Trump refused to accept a bipartisan agreement to fund the govt and negotiate investments in border security. Our brand as a country is that we're a democracy -- we solve problems in a peaceful and rational way. 

To have most of our government shut down for 35 days exposes us to both greater risk and really harms our reputation as a global leader. https://t.co/KNoyEyhoTN Briefing the President and monitoring delays does exactly zero to keep people safe and let planes fly safely.

Tonight on the Senate floor, members from both parties voted to re-open the government, but not enough. Even fewer voted for the President’s demand for a wall. Is it going to take a breakdown in food security or airline security? 

Is it going to take an increase in crime or terrorism, an accident, or thousands more Americans struggling to feed their families, losing housing or electricity?

Thank you to our citizen soldiers for their service to our state and our nation. https://t.co/thUWgOjlZO Mr. President, it’s time for you to end this senseless shutdown.
https://t.co/ZbgXJjvHLz RT @FoxNewsSunday: On @nytimes story, @ChrisCoons tells Chris: "That was a concerning even an alarming report and it suggest to me that the… .@SenatorCarper, @RepLBR, and I agree: President Trump needs to come to the table, work with Democrats to reopen the federal government, and end this senseless government shutdown. We wrote about it in today’s News Journal @delawareonline 

https://t.co/YH3wLYYbK5 Joining @foxnewssunday in just a few minutes - tune in! RT @SenatorCarper: The #TrumpShutdown is hurting Delaware’s families, businesses, and our economy and the President must end it now. Read m… A great evening in Rehoboth to help get the word out about Delaware’s own Inland Bays oysters. We’re taking advantage of some small, targeted federal grants to help put Delaware oysters on the map, support local jobs, &amp; give folks another great reason to visit Delaware’s beaches. https://t.co/49ttq3fnd8 Surprised Daniel Kaminski, my principal nominee for an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy, at Polytech High School today.

Congratulations, Daniel -- you have worked hard to achieve this honor and I know you will make our state proud. https://t.co/s6F6YEXlrL RT @FoxNewsSunday: EXCLUSIVE: Chris Coons (D), Delaware Senator will be on Fox News Sunday #FoxNews #FNS https://t.co/X8A8YsXuB0 The bad news – because of this senseless government shutdown, the National Science Foundation (@NSF) is shut down, meaning that important work like this isn’t happening all around the country.

We can do better, and we must do better to support important projects like this one. This funding will support critical research focused on keeping Delaware’s water safe and protecting our coastal environment from the effects of climate change. Great news for Delaware today! We announced nearly $20 million in federal funds for research at @UDelaware @DelStateUniv @WesleyCollegeDE &amp; @delawaretech from the National Science Foundation (@NSF). https://t.co/LPzGYtwMYW I’m grateful to DE law enforcement and service providers for their efforts to identify and protect victims of trafficking in Delaware, and will continue working to support federal efforts to combat trafficking both at home and abroad. Today is National #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. An estimated 40 million people are in modern slavery around the world, including in the United States. “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex." Soon, those long overdue words will be added to Delaware’s constitution. A proud day for our state! https://t.co/QfEPtuKhk3 “Because of the federal government shutdown, 10 new crashes in which 22 people died have not been investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.”

Mr. President, it’s past time to end this ridiculous shutdown.

https://t.co/zOeoLhnnWe Contract workers and their families should not suffer the consequences of a shutdown they didn’t cause. 

Read our letter: https://t.co/vvmbajN59c Today, @SenatorCarper and I joined other Dem senators in urging the Trump Administration to work with contractors to provide back pay to employees for wages lost during this shutdown. Air traffic controllers are highly skilled workers who perform a job that is critical to public safety, and they are already short-staffed. 

They deserve the President’s support and assurance that they will get paid for their work. Mr. President, it’s time for you to end this ridiculous shutdown.

https://t.co/oI3JoWpHZc RT @SenatorCarper: The #TrumpShutdown is preventing some Delawareans from getting their USDA-backed home loans. It doesn’t need to be this… RT @JohnCarneyDE: Thank you to all #Delaware law enforcement officers for the sacrifices you and your families make to keep our communities… RT @CoryBooker: Results of Mueller’s investigation, so far:
☑️ 4 people sentenced
☑️ 1 person convicted at trial
☑️ 7 people pleaded guilty… Listen to the story of Ms. Keller. 

Listen to the stories of the 800,000 other federal workers who aren’t receiving paychecks this week. 

We must help our constituents, not make their lives harder. 

https://t.co/ffdm4LIQTH “The loss of officers, while we're already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we don't have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires.” 

There is no excuse for this. 

https://t.co/GelMVyk0q2 There is bipartisan support to re-open the government today. 

Our President needs to understand the widespread impacts of continuing to prolong this shutdown and how the uncertainty he created is impacting a wide range of projects, including highway construction. https://t.co/g0C2eKxWUM Pell grants, student loans, parent PLUS loans, and other forms of federal financial aid could be blocked. 

Students could be prevented from enrolling in spring classes or the upcoming academic year. 

Enough is enough – it’s past time the President ends this senseless shutdown. https://t.co/x90n7mYNEu Rather than threatening to withhold disaster aid to help Americans recover from the devastating Camp &amp; Woolsey Fires, Pres. Trump should ensure that the federal government is taking steps to prepare for future disasters &amp; to address the increased risks we face from climate change https://t.co/P6wYrlehfl This makes the hearing next week for Pres Trump’s Attorney General nominee, Bill Barr, even more important. It’s critical that he make clear during his hearing that he is committed to the rule of law &amp; that he will not allow Pres Trump to interfere with the Mueller investigation. https://t.co/3VSb34zy7N It is my hope that he will understand in the coming days that he needs to accept one of the bipartisan options available to him to re-open the government and make sensible, robust investments in border security that we can all agree on The President’s continued insistence on building a wall along our southern border, which he justifies with misleading and even false information, is not productive and only serves to further divide our country. I am willing to vote to invest in effective border security that will address the problems we face. I am not going to support a costly &amp;  ineffective wall that will do nothing to stop the majority of drugs &amp; criminals that enter our country through airports or land ports of entry
