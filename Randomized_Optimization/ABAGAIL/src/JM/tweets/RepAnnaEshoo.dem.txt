I thought I was voting on a suspension bill, and I have since submitted a statement for the Congressional Record reflecting that I intended to vote against the rule.

The PREEMIE Act, my legislation that became law in 2006, expanded research, education and intervention efforts to reduce preterm births and improve treatment for premature infants and their mothers. This important law was allowed to expire last September. Today, one in ten babies are born prematurely which puts them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems. November is Prematurity Awareness Month, a national initiative to raise awareness about the crisis of preterm births in our country. For the first time in almost a decade, the rate of preterm births began rising in the United States in 2015. To all who celebrate this joyous festival in my Congressional District and around the world, may your Diwali be filled with light, happiness and hope for the future. Today is the first day of Diwali, the Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist “Festival of Lights.” During Diwali, families and friends come together to light oil lamps called diyas which represent the triumph of good over evil. https://t.co/fhEZxnTNHV I’ve introduced the Election Day Holiday Act with @RepMcEachin to make Election Day a federal holiday so more Americans have the time they need to vote and participate in our democracy.

Congress should pass my legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act to require the President to release his tax returns, ensuring that the highest office in the land is held to the highest standard of transparency. The American people have no way of knowing the magnitude this loophole represents to the President without the release of his tax returns. President Trump has more conflicts of interest than any president in our history. According to his candidate filing w/ the @FEC, he has 564 financial positions in companies in the US &amp; around the world, including relationships w/ state-affiliated businesses in several countries. A new report from the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) shows that a loophole in the Republican tax law could make some of the President’s foreign income from his businesses around the world virtually tax-free. https://t.co/PtGoBYf42n We must end discrimination against LGBTQ individuals in employment, housing and education.

We must enact policies to protect our planet from the existential threat of climate change, including putting a price on carbon, recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement, increasing fuel efficiency standards, and investing in clean energy. In it they warned that by 2040, 50 million people will be displaced by rising sea levels, 350 million people will endure severe drought, and more than a billion people will experience extreme heat waves unless we act now to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

https://t.co/mpCZTaLcqI The Treasury Dept just reported that the federal budget deficit grew to an astounding $779 billion in FY2018, an increase of almost 17%. The massive increase in the deficit is a direct result of the massive tax cut legislation that Republicans rushed through Congress last year.

I’m proud that the Know the Cost Act, legislation I introduced with 9 colleagues to eliminate gag clauses was signed into law last week. By lifting these outrageous restrictions, this legislation will help families in my District &amp; across the country to save costs of medications. ‘Gag clauses’ prohibit pharmacists from telling patients when they can pay less for their prescriptions by paying out of pocket, contributing to the rising cost of prescription drugs. 

https://t.co/77rXizxckP Our country’s immigration policies should reflect our values. Instead, this rule punishes those who are trying to pursue the American dream. The rule is designed to clearly disallow immigrants from seeking the health care &amp; food assistance they &amp; their families may have an urgent need for. The Trump Administration has proposed yet another cruel rule that restricts immigrants’ access to green cards if they have used Medicaid and SNAP.

To read more about the Social Security 2100 Act, click here: https://t.co/rKZDnUSDN8 I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Social Security 2100 Act which cuts taxes on middle class beneficiaries and strengthens the Social Security Trust Fund for today’s beneficiaries and future generations. Social Security has provided an unbroken promise of financial security to millions of Americans,including more than 100,000 beneficiaries in our District. For seniors,there’s a monthly check. For widows, children&amp;the disabled...they’re kept out of poverty &amp; America is kept whole. 83 years ago today, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, creating our nation’s most popular and successful government insurance program. https://t.co/apKwXxOkaf In a democracy, there should be many voices to the many, not fewer and I'm glad that this mega-merger is dead. https://t.co/yyHalksnPv The collapse of this merger is a huge win for consumers. If approved, Sinclair would have controlled 73 percent of the market in the U.S., the largest broadcast company in the country. It would have had damaging effects on the integrity and diversity of our broadcast media. https://t.co/ntIkotamB3 As other countries focus on increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the President is surrendering American leadership on progress made. I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of a resolution (H.Con.Res. 130) opposing this harmful policy. The Administration’s plan to weaken fuel economy standards and deny California the right to set our own standards will cause more air pollution, contribute to climate change, threaten public health, and cost families more at the pump.

https://t.co/CFh5DHIqSW I’m a proud to be an original cosponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act which restores the law because the right to vote is a fundamental right in our democracy and it must be protected.  #VotingRightsAct In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the law, allowing states with a history of discrimination to restrict voting rights in the absence of federal oversight. #VotingRightsAct On this day in 1965, President Johnson signed the #VotingRightsAct into law, prohibiting literacy tests, racial gerrymandering, and other forms of voter suppression.

We should honor them by protecting their legal status permanently. #TransBanTweetUp Thankfully, two federal judges issued injunctions allowing transgender Americans to continue to serve, but the permanent legal status of transgender troops remains uncertain. #TransBanTweetUp A year ago today the President demeaned and degraded the patriotic service of many members of our nation’s armed forces by reinstating the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. #TransBanTweetUp RT @armenianinterns: Thank you @RepAnnaEshoo for meeting with our summer interns yesterday to discuss US Armenia relations and Armenian iss… I oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination and should he be confirmed, I will fight for legislation that protects a woman’s right to reproductive choice. #CommitToRoe The President explicitly pledged to appoint justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, and his nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court places this critical ruling and the rights of women at enormous risk. #CommitToRoe Roe v. Wade recognizes that the decision to opt for or against an abortion is a difficult and private one, implicating issues of faith and conscience and should be left to each woman to decide for herself. #CommitToRoe RT @NancyPelosi: So special to have California Lieutenant Governor (&amp; former SF Mayor) Gavin Newsom join us for today’s California Democrat… I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Raise the Wage Act which gradually increases the hourly federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15.00 by 2024 which will help reduce income inequality, increase consumer demand, and strengthen the economy for all Americans. Nine years ago today was the last time Congress raised the federal minimum wage. Today, millions of Americans are still struggling to make ends meet as the cost of living continues to climb. Congress should follow California’s lead and guarantee a living wage to all workers.

Our diplomats across the world deserve to know this President will support and protect their work. By refusing to denounce and immediately reject Russia’s request to interrogate a former U.S. Ambassador, Donald Trump has once again disgraced the United States and its government and confirmed he is nothing more than a stooge for Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/RMuViLVcgH
