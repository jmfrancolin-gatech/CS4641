The Department of Interior has agreed to help keep our parks open and protected for visitors. It's important we remove the burden from our local governments. https://t.co/iVKRe1M9uc RT @GovHerbert: We so appreciate the @Interior Department‚Äôs quick response to our House members‚Äô and the state‚Äôs request for federal suppor‚Ä¶ I've received a response from the @Interior sharing their plans to keep Utah's parks protected and open for visitors. I'm thankful for the extraordinary steps they're taking to conserve our park resources. Many of the burdens will be addressed within days. https://t.co/HU2VpeKrIc It's a sad day in Provo. One of the City's Finest was shot and killed outside a business late last night in Orem. I was the Provo mayor for 8 years and don't know a more dedicated group of first responders. Thank you. We won't forget. https://t.co/UGVwMsjAno It's a sad day in Provo. One of the City's Finest was shot and killed outside a business late last night in Orem. I pray today for the family, friends, and fellow officers who know and love him. I hope they'll find peace. Thank you for your dedication. We won't forget. Thanks to the Department of Interior and State of Utah for helping keep Utah's national parks open during this shutdown. We can do more. Today, I've joined Representatives Bishop and Stewart in asking the DOI to use the Antideficiency Act which will safeguard our visitors. https://t.co/Guh8tW1Fac Washington should take note of states like Utah that do it right. Not only does the Utah Legislature pass a baseline budget at the beginning of each session to avoid any state government shutdown threats, but they also responsibility balance the state‚Äôs budget every year. https://t.co/kBDpqRmdSn "Utah Representative John Curtis made waves of his own, filing one of the first bills of the 116th Congressional session." https://t.co/3yCkWuVcJr Happy 123rd Birthday, Utah! https://t.co/Ie6smMI4Ky Happy birthday Utah! Today our beautiful state turns 123 years young. #45thstate #happybirthdayutah #beaUTAHful #utahisrad https://t.co/i6keCQ7MXn ICYMI: Yesterday I introduced the ‚ÄúNo Work, No Pay‚Äù bill to stop congressional pay during government shutdowns. I strongly believe that Congress should be held accountable to find common ground to solve this funding impasse. https://t.co/PONeZ6BvJP As I have done in previous government shutdowns, I have asked the Clerk of the House to withhold my pay until the government reopens. My No Work, No Pay Bill would require this for all Members of Congress #utpol https://t.co/kmNjbxKTMA RT @GlenMillsABC4: #Utah @RepJohnCurtis says congress shouldn‚Äôt get paid during a shutdown. He‚Äôs introducing a bill to make it happen. #utp‚Ä¶ https://t.co/LgVB1icUXB The American people expect Congress to do its most basic job: pass a budget and fund the government. If we can‚Äôt, then we shouldn‚Äôt get paid. Today I introduced H.R. 26, the "No Work, No Pay Act of 2019." My bill would prohibit Congress from being paid during government shutdowns Please join me for a Townhall Meeting on Tuesday, January 22 from 7:00-8:30pm at the Provo Recreation Center (320 W 500 N).

Congress must be held accountable. If we can't do our job, we shouldn't get paid. #utpol We've moved offices in DC!

His leadership made our world better and I am grateful for his service. My THIRD bill is on the way to the President. The Small Business ACE Act will ensure #smallbiz has more efficient access to capital without costing the tax-payer a single dollar. We are one step closer to keeping the govt from getting in the way. https://t.co/Iq6LtA0Ibk I am concerned that the mission in Syria is not yet accomplished and we should stay the course to eliminate Iranian influence, counter Russia‚Äôs troubling behavior in the region, and ensure the long-term stability of Syria. #utpol I am a strong supporter of our brave military men and women, and I strongly agree that we must find a way to end the conflict in Syria. However, the defeat of ISIS is a long-term endeavor.   #utpol Out of this world! https://t.co/ZJdJmJhFok Thank you, Mr. Speaker. https://t.co/rx6tM7f8z8 RT @1059KNRS: At 6:05 pm today on the @RodArquette Show: @RepJohnCurtis on the passage of his bill, now on @POTUS desk, that would create a‚Ä¶ Our historic bill is becoming law - my second one this Congress.
