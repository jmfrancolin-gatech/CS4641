And yet, employers are still failing pregnant workers and forcing women to choose between healthy pregnancies and their families‚Äô economic security. #PDA40 Did you know businesses owned by women of color grew by 163 percent over the last 10 years?  #WomenInBiz https://t.co/UHDxeD2DOP October 25th marked the 30th Anniversary of the Women‚Äôs Business Ownership Act (H.R 5050), which eliminated laws requiring women to have a male relative or husband cosign to receive a loan.  Now there are nearly 10 million women-owned businesses.  #WomenInBiz https://t.co/VmBUxzt7jQ The purging of the 107,000 voters from the rolls in Georgia is one of the most intentional cases of voter suppression I have ever witnessed.  We must all vote Nov. 6 to send a message that we will not let anyone take away our right to #VOTE! #SuppressionSaga Divisive political rhetoric motivates violent individuals and domestic terrorists who commit hate crimes against innocent people. As we mourn with and pray for those affected by shootings in Jeffersontown, KY and Pittsburgh, PA last week, let us work to unify and rid this country of ideologies only meant to divide us. #WordsHaveConsequences Update: Saturday's shooting was an example of the violence that continues to plague our country.  We now know 11 people lost their lives and 6 were injured including 4 officers.  I remain prayerful for the families of Tree of Life Synagogue and the entire Squirrel Hill community. It has been an exciting two days discussing STREAM with Educators, Executives and Students. Tomorrow, the NEOSTREAM Conference ends with Community Day @ CSU 8 a.m. ‚Äì 1:30 p.m. There will be something for everyone! #NEOSTREAM2018 https://t.co/qQJJZkUiZS I commend the heroism of our Secret Service officers, Capitol officials, and first responders who tirelessly keep us safe. Words have consequences, and it is time for the President stop condoning violence and dividing Americans with his harmful rhetoric. https://t.co/TYMC2VQE5F Today's bomb threats are nothing short of domestic terrorism.  I pray for the safety of my colleagues and those responsible are immediately apprehended and brought to justice. Did you know by 2018, 2.4 million STEM jobs will go unfilled?

For more information, visit my website at https://t.co/LUi7MUR9wr. https://t.co/oPKnZHh2Ma Today I joined more than 150 House Democrats in signing a letter to Sec. DeVos calling on the release of information about the DOE's handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program because our public servants deserve better.    
https://t.co/Ff6rXXl0y3 https://t.co/UGvg4BoBID Did you know women and children worldwide suffer the most serious effects of hunger and malnutrition? Today, I fight to bring awareness and action for those who suffer from hunger and for the need to ensure food security and nutritious diets for all. #zerohunger #WFD2018 https://t.co/twNU7xjQvw Mark Norris joins an overwhelmingly white, male, young, and extremely conservative group with a track record of oppressive ideologies.  Exercising your right to vote matters now more than ever. #SuppressionSaga Norris sponsored a resolution prohibiting the removal of Confederate monuments from parks and public spaces in Tennessee, undermining the very foundation of American values. His record shows he cannot be trusted to make fair and just decisions. #SuppressionSaga Last week, Senate Republicans confirmed Mark Norris as a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee.  Norris has an appalling record of opposing equal rights, including supporting Tennessee‚Äôs 2012 strict voter ID requirements. #SuppressionSaga Erecting barriers that specifically disenfranchise voters who use a P. O. Box rather than a street address is not protecting the right to vote.  Native Americans deserve the right to vote regardless of their address type. #SuppressionSaga The DOJ has failed to protect #VotingRights since the day Jeff Sessions walked in the door, reversing decisions on key cases including on Ohio‚Äôs voter purge law. 
#SuppressionSaga Republican Senators showed once again that they don‚Äôt really care about Civil Rights.  Thursday‚Äôs confirmation of Eric Dreiband to lead the Civil Rights Division threatens the DOJ‚Äôs duty to protect our fundamental rights. #SuppressionSaga I am saddened &amp; disheartened at the lengths Georgia officials will go to so boldly silence the voices of their constituents ‚Äì but I am not surprised anymore.  For democracy to function, each and every person must be heard. #SuppressionSaga Once again, Republicans are spearheading an effort to disenfranchise 53,000 Georgians.  70% are African-American and another 10% are Latino or Asian-American.  This is a clear act of blatant and discriminatory voter suppression. #SuppressionSaga If your vote wasn‚Äôt so powerful, they wouldn‚Äôt keep trying to take it from you. #SuppressionSaga

https://t.co/pBeUnQUT4V It's morally wrong to have federal judges and prosecutors who enforce federal law in U.S. territories who are nominated by a President U.S. citizens of these territories can‚Äôt vote for and confirmed by a Senate where citizens lack any representation. #Fairness4Territories #SCOTUS More than nine million American citizens are denied the same right to vote that they would enjoy if living in another part of the country. The government should not deny any citizen the right to vote based on where they live. #Fairness4Territories #SCOTUS He may have violated the very laws he is sworn to uphold.  My heart goes out to all victims of sexual assault. I stand with and will continue to fight for them. I also believe and stand with Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh is unfit to be a judge especially on the highest court in the land. Thursday, he showed the nation that he has neither the judicial temperament nor the impartiality to serve on the Supreme Court.  
https://t.co/JeZduJmt47 From the 19th Amendment to the Voting Rights Act, women have fought for our right to have a voice. Today, on #NationalVoterRegistrationDay we must remember that our vote is our voice. Remember to register! #VOTE #WomenVote https://t.co/70RmdzaseM
