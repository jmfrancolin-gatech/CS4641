More to come in Modesto, Turlock, Hughson, Manteca, and Tracy. Our listening tour is off to a great start! @xManuel209x Google maps says it‚Äôs just 42 hours to Tracy! I‚Äôve voted consistently to reopen our government - the Senate must either vote on one of those bills or come up with an alternative. The costs of this shutdown are enormous and growing. My flight home to California is delayed several hours because there aren‚Äôt enough air traffic controllers. Paying employees to keep our skies safe should be common sense! @WDlolz99 Congrats Julissa! Well deserved!

https://t.co/UZFuUcUzkl The reason @RepJeffDenham is lying about healthcare in this election is simple: To distract from the key vote he took in May of 2017 to take away healthcare from 100,000 of his own constituents.

https://t.co/rzJgnOVaS0 Joined our Jewish Community for the Vigil in Solidarity with the Jewish people hurt in Pittsburgh. This is a terrible atrocity that should not be tolerated.

For real change in the Central Valley, sign up to help me in this last month: https://t.co/wUP29kxwn4 https://t.co/91Bzz9LlVu .@RepJeffDenham and his special interest buddies have been lying about me because they're scared of what i promise to fight for in Congress: ban lobbyist fundraising, stop corporate handouts, and oppose any tax or tariff that hurts the middle class. #CA10 https://t.co/uE7yLA1Qaa When the facts aren‚Äôt on their side, @RepJeffDenham and his allies resort to making stuff up.

https://t.co/AMQaW6jbIP An almond farmer from Oakdale, Margo, is upset about the uncertainty around selling her almonds in the midst of this Trade War. This trade war is gambling with her family's livelihood and Margo is volunteering because @RepJeffDenham is doing little to address this hurtful policy. https://t.co/HOE6iLDlEO 20 days left!

Volunteer 2day: https://t.co/TvxA3umjbX https://t.co/yEP8FaBxZB If Washington Republicans like @RepJeffDenham win re-election, they will take another shot at repealing affordable healthcare from 20 million Americans.

I will work hard to represent Central Valley families-- not Party Bosses or Corporate Interests like my opponent. https://t.co/5zFudtt1Wt They're saying it clear as day: if we don't make a change, Republicans in Washington will put Social Security and Medicare under the chopping block.

üó≥Voting on a bill causing Central Valley families‚Äô healthcare premiums to drastically rise 

https://t.co/qnqUjeMDKY #FlashbackFriday

When @RepJeffDenham said he supports a #CleanDreamAct and Immigration Reform shortly before voting against both. https://t.co/sUz96SmhtC What are your plans for the weekend? I am relying on grassroots support from people like you. We are challenging one of the most well funded members in the nation. @RepJeffDenham‚Äôs support comes from Corporate PACs and Special Interests.

Sign up TODAY: https://t.co/Lgq1JFmAYO https://t.co/v4QwS3hwyJ Thank you Latino Community Roundtable for inviting me to join in celebrating #HispanicHeritageMonth! The music, mariachi  and food was amazing. As your endorsed candidate, I‚Äôm proud of the contributions of the Latino Community to our Valley. https://t.co/qVfriCmY0F Who do you think @RepJeffDenham represents? https://t.co/2Sy2BMu0hg Helena was paralyzed from the stomach down in a car accident. She relies on Medicaid for the vital physical therapy she needs to be able to work  again. @RepJeffDenham voted to take health care from Californians like Helena. California deserves better. #CA10 https://t.co/XEXnj7spbL Today on National Voter Registration Day, please make sure you are registered! The election is in six weeks and we need everyone to make sure their voices are heard. We have volunteer opportunities every day to register new voters.

Looking forward to discussing issues that affect the African American community and our community in Central Valley as a whole...

#16TownHallsin16Weeks https://t.co/g92JPw2QTV Thank you Al. Veterans' contributions to this country are so important  to me. Protecting veterans' healthcare will be a priority for me in Congress. https://t.co/4xOQUF4qAF Thanks for hosting me California Alliance for Retired Americans. It‚Äôs obvious to me how important protecting our seniors citizens‚Äô hard earned social security and healthcare for ALL Americans is. https://t.co/dPTSA7lPXR Can you join my Latino Town Hall?

There will be music, community leaders from the Latino community and most importantly: an honest conversation on my plans for immigration reform and a Clean Dream Act.

Join me on Saturday Afternoon, Oct 6 at El Rematito. https://t.co/92zfbgZZ9R It has been 524 days since my opponent has hosted an open town hall in this district...  Join me at my 5 remaining Town Halls, part of my 16 Town Halls in 16 Weeks.  

Town Halls listed here: https://t.co/jOZwl0kUxu https://t.co/Kw5qB7Afx3 Remember when @RepJeffDenham declared his support for child detainment at Migrant Detention camps?

Denham's support of families torn apart has become a reality. #FamiliesBelongTogether

https://t.co/wRjsZKYKdK Meeting with farmers and neighbors at the Modesto Farmers Market. Ag is the backbone of the Central Valley economy and I will work hard to fight for water for the Central Valley to support our farmers. https://t.co/8gVcnfYJl8 Great point, Michael.  @RepJeffDenham receives almost 70% of his funding from Washington Special Interests and corporate PACs. 

I have taken the #NoCorporatePAC pledge to ensure that I represent YOU, not the Koch Brothers, companies or party bosses.  https://t.co/TREeJRCQif Thank you Mayor Molina. I will work my hardest to bring much deserved opportunities to the Central Valley. https://t.co/5nSuQCkTqq During the debate today, we were pretty shocked to find out @RepJeffDenham is proud of voting to take healthcare away from 100,000 Central Valley constituents. https://t.co/k2QQ6u2VrQ RT @DrewGodinich: If you were just watching @joshua_harder wipe the floor with @JeffDenham at the #CA10Debate - holding him accountable for‚Ä¶ Join us this morning by following the link below as we talk about our vision for the Central Valley ‚Äî one with comprehensive immigration reform, healthcare coverage for everyone, and good-paying jobs right here in the Valley.

#16TownHalls16Weeks https://t.co/TKFdWxpfY4 Today, at @modbee Editorial Board, this district saw the sad reality that @RepJeffDenham has been in DC for too long: Denham is so out of touch with the values of the Central Valley that he wouldn't even pledge to refuse campaign donations from indicted members of Congress. https://t.co/8nLODrkzIF Today, I will be talking with @modbee and Jeff Denham at 3:30pm about jobs, healthcare, and immigration reform. Join me by clicking on the facebook stream below! 

https://t.co/u0f3jEIUPF Because of the trade war and the ineffectiveness of Congressmembers like @RepJeffDenham, the net cash farm income has decreased in every American region this past year. 

That‚Äôs unacceptable. We need leaders who will fight for farmers in the Central Valley. https://t.co/qGVfvYRQSL I appreciate the support Ryan. Vocational training programs and apprenticeship programs are just a few of my plans to bring Central Valley great jobs. https://t.co/RNbQIDVs39 Almost 70% of  my opponent's contributions come from Washington Special Interests and Corporate PACs. I took the #NoCorporatePACPledge so you know I represent real people.

Its time for a change and we need YOUR help knocking on doors and making calls: https://t.co/carV6Qf8rX https://t.co/dtJfgLh2FM Again, @RepJeffDenham abandons the Central Valley residents on healthcare. 

Enough is enough. Its time for leaders who represents the Central Valley, not corporate PACs and Special Interests. That's why I have taken the #NoCorporatePACpledge so I represent Central Valley voters. https://t.co/vDNyUXuELB Thank you, Tiffanie from Tracy. My priority will always be voting on behalf of Central Valley constituents over Party Bosses or Washington Special Interests. 

https://t.co/wpyKc5JjoL Thank you for welcoming me to the Assyrian Festival this past weekend. We enjoyed amazing food and an incredible parade. https://t.co/urty947IoB @realDonaldTrump plans to impose duties on roughly $200 billion more in Chinese goods as soon as today. The move could escalate the trade war, prompting China to add another round of tariffs on American ag products. Meanwhile, @RepJeffDenham is silent...

We are knocking on doors and making calls every single day until the Election. https://t.co/hulTbxo6rm Thank you Tracy volunteers for pulling together such a well attended Town Hall. 6 more town halls to talk about my plans for comprehensive immigration reform, water and jobs. Town Halls listed here: https://t.co/jOZwl0kUxu

https://t.co/IqtyKAwEBx Honored that Latino Community Roundtable switched their endorsement from @RepJeffDenham to support my campaign. Our community is beginning to see through Denham's rhetoric: Denham has a very long record of saying one thing to our community, and voting for his Special Interests. https://t.co/spCbuUT0os @RepJeffDenham has once again betrayed the Central Valley on water in failing to sign onto the anti-Delta Tunnels letter just weeks after taking a controversial vote which would fast-track the Delta Tunnels (HR 6147).

Central Valley deserves better. 

#DishonestDenham https://t.co/Rj7GeDR0GN Time and time again, politicians like @JeffDenham risk Americans‚Äô hard earned social security in order to give massive  tax cuts to their Wall Street donors. I will fight to ensure our seniors  retire comfortably and with dignity. https://t.co/vWOdlIpEL9 Assyrian TV interview tonight- discussing the campaign https://t.co/2fLLesdcsc Join me Saturday for my Education Town Hall. I want to hear MORE about what I can do to improve the quality of education for our Central Valley students.
