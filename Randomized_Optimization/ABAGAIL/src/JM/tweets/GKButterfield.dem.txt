Read this week's Washington Rundown here: https://t.co/aIO1xg4sVg After defeat of Thomas Farr, Sen. Tim Scott writes: ‚ÄúWe should stop bringing candidates with questionable track records on race before the full Senate for a vote.‚Äù 
This should be a no brainer, but sadly, the Senate needs this reminder.

Rest In Peace, Mrs. Rosanell Eaton. https://t.co/ru1JoQ8skJ North Carolina and the nation have lost a fierce civil rights leader and warrior, Mrs. Rosanell Eaton. Mrs. Eaton led the fight against North Carolina's attempts to disenfranchise voters. She will be sorely missed. https://t.co/GUaFJmo3FQ RT @CharlieReece: My awesome Member of Congress! https://t.co/sczEtO0fg5 RT @ADouglasNews: US Rep. G.K.

It was only right that my intern (and Durham native), Johnson, and I properly recognize the occassion. Thank you for your service to #NC01, Johnson! https://t.co/5g9p7MbkHM It is interesting that this alleged absentee ballot scheme was reported to the United States Attorney‚Äôs office after the 2016 elections and no official actions were taken to protect the integrity of the 2018 election in #NC09. An evidentiary hearing will disclose the obvious misconduct of Republican operatives in Bladen County and determine whether the Republican Party or its nominee knew or should have known of this absentee ballot election scheme. I am in continued communication with House leadership to ensure the House is prepared for every outcome including holding an emergency congressional hearing to determine whether there is substantial evidence of election fraud in #NC09 on the part of Mark Harris or his surrogates. Our democracy relies on fair elections.  The evidence of election fraud in North Carolina‚Äôs 9th Congressional District is mounting by the day. [thread] https://t.co/fhWeImAePP The allegations of widespread election fraud in #NC09 are serious. As the @NCSBE continues to investigate, we must consider all remedies that will ensure all voters‚Äô voices are heard. Do you or someone you know need health insurance?

For resources and frequently asked questions, visit my website at https://t.co/Su5tPOkcAf https://t.co/7p0TvpHKDf I join the country in mourning the loss of President George H.W. Bush. He led a life of public service with dignity, honor, and respect. Prayers to the Bush family as we reflect on a life well lived. As the first Black woman elected to Congress, Shirley Chisholm paved the way for so many. She dared to be true to justice and will forever be a model for this nation.   

Today she would have been 94. https://t.co/XZDCkWCtFB It is a sad day for Samuel Oliver-Bruno's family and our community as we learn that Mr. Oliver-Bruno has been deported. @RepDavidEPrice and I will continue to seek a full investigation into the actions of ICE &amp; USCIS leading up to Mr. Oliver-Bruno‚Äôs arrest on November 23. https://t.co/gjc3w44Nt3
