In 1966, she opened the first @AvilaElRanchito restaurant in #HuntingtonPark, and over the next 53 years, that location expanded to a chain of 13. I send my condolences to Margarita's family, who can be deeply proud of her legacy. https://t.co/WblaThfpnq This #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor the heritage &amp; achievements of African-Americans in #CA40 and nationwide. As we salute this legacy, let's also recommit to stamping out bigotry and injustice against communities of color. We can't stop until there is liberty and justice for ALL. https://t.co/5mZKUwEeFm Sending all my prayers and love to John and Debbie this morning. Please keep them in your hearts. https://t.co/AuNLJx6ezc These are all goals that can unite Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, and we need to make them law.  If the president is serious about unifying our country, I encourage him to join us in this critical work. I’ll be reintroducing the #DreamAct, offering #Dreamers a chance at a path to citizenship. As a member of the FY 2019 DHS funding bill conference committee, I’m also working with colleagues to develop smart, effective border security--not POTUS's costly &amp; unjustified border wall. America needs an agenda that works #ForThePeople, and that is exactly what our new House Democratic majority is working tirelessly to deliver: lower health care &amp; prescription drug costs, higher wages for U.S. workers by rebuilding our infrastructure, &amp; cleaning up DC corruption. Just attended the #SOTU. Unfortunately, despite the president's occasional gestures tonight toward bipartisanship and unity, he has failed to support the middle class, he has failed to unify our nation, and he has failed to afford basic dignity to countless men, women &amp; children. Thanked @TSA Admin. David Pekoske today for his agency's patience and hard work during the shutdown! As the new #DHS Appropriations Chair, I look forward to working with him and the #TSA to protect America's travelers. https://t.co/WpcHZ8dzPn With #CA40's Kenia Arredondo, my #SOTU guest!

She is a sterling example of how #DACA recipients strengthen our institutions, enrich our communities, &amp; preserve our nation’s promise. I am so glad to be joined at this year’s #SOTU by Kenia Arredondo, one of the hundreds of thousands of hardworking, patriotic Americans in the #DACA program.

I stand with my colleagues urging Governor Northam to do the right thing so that Virginians can have a leader they respect and trust, and Americans can continue to build a more fair and just country for all.

The #TrumpShutdown isn't a "vacation" for furloughed Americans—it's a nightmare. They aren't "better off"—they're giving up necessities to make ends meet.

We need money for critical security priorities—hiring more customs officers; hiring more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade &amp; child exploitation investigations; deploying more tech at our ports; strengthening our Coast Guard; and more—but not for Trump's wall. The real crisis is that children are dying in Border Patrol custody due to inadequate facilities and an utter lack of appropriate medical care. The president should be ramping up medical care for kids, not building a wall. The president thinks he can get you to believe there's a national emergency at the border, but there isn't. We need to get serious about keeping America safe, and we won't do that by spending billions of dollars on Trump's cruel and pointless border wall. Donald Trump can talk and tweet all day and all night, but he can't avoid the fact that he has shut down the government, and blocked the paychecks of 800,000 American workers, because he and his political base want an immoral, ineffective border wall.

Newsom to continue those critical efforts. https://t.co/3jFKQgaUuE My #Commerce district office is seeking motivated, dedicated college- and graduate-level #interns to help serve the 40th Congressional District for the winter 2019 term! Read the attached flyer for info, or visit https://t.co/0EYwA3x9VJ. https://t.co/WLG7ikNbBG Rather than squandering money on Trump's border wall, we should be investing in crucial national security priorities, like hiring more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade, and child exploitation investigations.
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/IAdTkpgSyU As we keep the victims of the Torrance shooting in our hearts today, I join with all those who know that enough is #Enough. It is long past time for America to make commonsense #GunSafety reforms that will reduce shootings and protect our loved ones. https://t.co/lQu14VaaFp What an amazing #FBF photo! Ileana @RosLehtinen, @NydiaVelazquez &amp; I were the first 3 Latinas in Congress, and I'm proud of how we were able to work side-by-side &amp; across-the-aisle. It's even more exciting to continue that partnership with 12 Latina sisters in the #116thCongress! https://t.co/WqUuQoESVt Forced to work without pay by the #TrumpShutdown, hundreds of TSA officers have become ill and are calling in sick. I want them to know I am working hard to reopen govt and restore their pay! This news is yet another example of how Trump's shutdown is hurting average Americans. https://t.co/UZYdnDKw3s Republicans have spent years attacking voting rights, rewarding wealthy donors &amp; special interests, and leaving working families behind. The GOP's #CultureOfCorruption must end NOW. Today, I joined my fellow @HouseDemocrats in unveiling our #ForThePeople Act to clean up our govt. https://t.co/ge22LkP2ay Don't let an earthquake take you by surprise! Download the new #ShakeAlertLA app to get early warning that a quake's on the way. https://t.co/VUD2W1qt0Z As the first Mexican-American congresswoman, elected in the first "Year of the Woman," I've seen the ranks of female Democrats get bigger &amp; more diverse over the years. Look at us now!

But we CAN'T stop here—women must have full &amp; equal representation in govt. Our fight goes on. https://t.co/nDvl8dYWyh Ultimately, the ones who suffer from this senseless #TrumpShutdown are millions of Americans – small business owners, farmers, and those helped by our federal civil servants. I hope @SenateMajLdr will do the right thing and hold a vote on this bill to fund the government. After 13 days of the #TrumpShutdown, 380,000 federal workers remain furloughed, and 420,000 are working without pay. We must end this shutdown and reopen our government. Voted tonight for H.R. 21, a bill that would fund 6 of the remaining 7 appropriations bills &amp; re-open parts of govt closed by this #TrumpShutdown. The bill passed the House with an overwhelming Democratic majority – proof on day one that @HouseDemocrats are working #ForThePeople! Helped lead tonight's passage of a resolution to fund DHS through Feb. 8. That would give us time to negotiate a DHS funding bill for the rest of FY19. We shouldn’t waste money on Trump's border wall -- we need that money for our most pressing &amp; critical homeland security needs. https://t.co/wmoMBQ6qes At press conference tonight w/ @SpeakerPelosi in support of @HouseDemocrats' plan to end the #TrumpShutdown: Pass the 6 bipartisan FY19 funding bills &amp; extend DHS funding a month. We CANNOT waste money on Trump's border wall—we need those funds for other pressing security needs. https://t.co/P2p3URx2dR What a privilege to cast my vote today for the fearless and brilliant Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker of the House! Congratulations, @SpeakerPelosi – a dedicated progressive champion #ForThePeople, and a great friend. https://t.co/MKz6FPphKC As @HouseDemocrats enter the majority today, I can't wait to keep fighting alongside my dear friend @RosaDeLauro to deliver #ABetterDeal #ForThePeople. https://t.co/Qr4nXdtEwn As #CA40 congresswoman, I'll keep working to create jobs &amp; increase paychecks; lower the cost of health care &amp; prescription drugs; make a good higher education accessible for everyone; enact comprehensive &amp; humane immigration reform; and clean our communities' air, land &amp; water. An exciting and historic day for our country -- it's the start of the 116th Congress! I'm honored to be sworn in to represent California's 40th Congressional District, and to be part of a new House Democratic Majority that will work #ForThePeople. https://t.co/wPhSzIHuBR America needs to invest more money in first responder grants to better prepare states and localities to prevent and respond to terrorism and other disasters. We can't do that if we waste that money on Trump's border wall. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/e3VFpTrwa8 American businesses need us to fund more customs officers at our ports to speed up the flow of commerce &amp; travel. Wasting money on Trump's border wall would mean no funding to hire those officers. That would force real economic costs on U.S. businesses, and we CANNOT allow that. Funding Trump's border wall would keep us from funding critical national security priorities, including protecting America against actions by nations like Russia &amp; China. For example, we MUST procure a new heavy icebreaker so we can protect our vital Arctic security interests. Loved seeing the @DowneyRoseFloat Association's amazing "Let's Go to the Hop" float in this year's #RoseParade. So much hard work paid off to create this beautiful entry -- what a credit to the creativity and ingenuity of all involved! https://t.co/BPpiPDg6Nu 2019 is here! I hope this new year brings you new opportunities and wonderful memories. 2019 also brings a new Congress, starting this Thursday -- I'm excited to be sworn in as part of a new House Majority, and to continue my work to help all our 40th District communities. The Trump border wall rips away money for critical national security priorities -- protecting America from foreign threats, hiring more customs officers to speed up commerce at our ports, funding first responder grants to prepare our communities to respond to disasters, and more. As top Dem on DHS Appropriations, it’s great that Democrats have released a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown. This bill will fund our govt again and pay our federal workers again, while rejecting Donald Trump’s $5 billion demand for his useless border wall. https://t.co/4BnsdiRLKL Trump’s immoral, expensive, and ineffective border wall faces bipartisan opposition from Democrats and many Republicans. There is absolutely no excuse for making it the basis of this latest #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/5QalRgM22Z Who is forced to work w/ no pay during the #TrumpShutdown? Our fellow Americans working at @DHSgov, @StateDept, @USDA, @Interior, @USTreasury, @TheJusticeDept, @CommerceGov, @USDOT, @HUDgov, @EPA, @NASA, @PeaceCorps, @SBAGov &amp; other agencies. Trump must end his govt shutdown NOW! You are a father and a grandfather.  Please show some fatherly compassion to those less fortunate than yourself who find themselves in U.S. custody. 
https://t.co/W05H17gsHG Mr. President, CHILDREN died in your administration’s care. Your attempt to politicize their tragic deaths to score political points is a new low even by the standards of your own policies.
https://t.co/syjCQMIVUa Just weeks after a massive recall on romaine lettuce made national news, the #TrumpShutdown significantly impacts the ability of the FDA to carry out food safety inspections. Donald Trump, end this shutdown now! https://t.co/CWe3vfrJ0V The #TrumpShutdown is forcing 800,000 federal employees who work for us to go without holiday pay. They shouldn't be denied their paychecks just because Trump can't get his campaign slogan border wall. https://t.co/7QxYajLzCy Donald Trump needs to stop holding the nation hostage to his radical demands for an ineffective and expensive border wall.  End the #TrumpShutdown, Mr. President! https://t.co/nyDfAfNNQo Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to open the govt. The proposals include funding for strong, sensible, effective border security – but not the Trump border wall. I urge the president and his GOP colleagues to stand with Democrats and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/RNc9ThUDYl As the weeklong #Kwanzaa holiday begins, I send best wishes to all who are celebrating! May it be an inspirational and unifying time. Why is it so hard for Donald Trump to accept that the majority of Americans won’t support his border wall? We’ve been clear on this for over a year. He needs to accept the facts, move on, and let Congress reopen the government. #NoBorderWall #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/JkeexHKv4U As top Democrat on the DHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I will keep fighting Trump’s irresponsible, uncaring, and hateful immigration policies. Any U.S. President must ALWAYS ensure their administration prioritizes the well-being of the children in its care. Heartbroken to hear ANOTHER immigrant child has died in CBP custody. While we don’t know all the details yet, the death of this child is outrageous. We need a full investigation and accounting of this horrific tragedy. https://t.co/2YWchdSkZg #MerryChristmas! Wishing you and your family a day full of joy, happiness, and togetherness. https://t.co/Sg5FrazQdH Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They have the responsibility and power to keep government open. Instead, they've forced a #TrumpShutdown that's hurting hundreds of thousands of families in the middle of the holiday season.
https://t.co/724pegAgNM America’s federal employees work hard to serve our country and us. They deserve to be able to pay their rent, buy holiday gifts, and put food on the table. It’s time to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown and let them enjoy the holiday season! https://t.co/ZpKfnStQN9 Wondering what the #TrumpShutdown of government means for Americans?  Read this quick explainer. https://t.co/jk2vFqTiyI DON'T FORGET: Donald Trump claimed the #TrumpShutdown. On Dec. 11, he said: “I am proud to shut down the government…I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it.” He can’t escape responsibility for it now. Donald Trump has forced this shutdown because he wants to spend billions on an immoral, expensive, and ineffective border wall. America needs him to step up and demonstrate the responsibility his position demands. I call on him to stand with Democrats to end the #TrumpShutdown. Very pleased the Supreme Court upheld the block against Trump’s asylum ban. His ban deserves to be roundly defeated — it totally goes against America’s history of providing humanitarian relief to vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution. https://t.co/17yVZDhL87 Republicans have failed to govern once again. They are forcing Americans to pay for a wall, and they are willing to shut down the government to do so. We have many more urgent homeland security needs than this trophy for President Trump. https://t.co/cfyH9D8Lvp When Democrats assume leadership of the House next month, we must fight to spend Homeland Security funds responsibly, limit funding for harmful Trump immigration policies, and conduct strict oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. As the top Democrat on the House DHS Approps Subcommittee, I will keep fighting for policies that keep our country safe.  We cannot afford to waste money on Trump’s immoral, ineffective, and expensive border wall, especially when there are so many genuine DHS needs we must fund. Republican leadership has failed to govern. By choosing to pursue a second CR instead of passing appropriations bills that truly meet our nation’s needs, Republicans have failed to provide government agencies with the certainty they need to serve the American people. .@CoveredCA Open Enrollment lasts until January 15, 2019.

This misguided ruling completely fails to reflect Congress's intent to expand access to healthcare and protect those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/OmQDTzhQmA Americans voted for a government that worked for the people this November – and the fight to avoid another #TrumpShutdown is a sign that, once again, Republicans just aren’t listening. https://t.co/5Otdo9np0O Today, as we continued to mourn the heartbreaking death of a 7-year-old girl in @CBP custody, I joined with fellow @HouseDemocrats to write to @DHSOIG demanding an investigation of this horrific tragedy, and why CBP failed to meet the requirement of notifying Congress right away. https://t.co/dRqdvbLwsy RT @NancyPelosi: .@RepRoybalAllard is tired of seeing Republicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump shut down government instead of working for the Americ… This is yet another example of how the Trump Administration puts NO value on the lives and dignity of our immigrant brothers and sisters. I am FIERCELY committed to fighting that cruelty with every power of my office and every breath in my body. As a mother, as a grandmother, and as an American, I am horrified, heartbroken, and infuriated that a 7-year-old little girl died in Trump Administration custody. We must investigate her death FULLY, including CBP’s actions, and make certain that justice is served. https://t.co/MOPVTSv8BA
