My statement on the 51st anniversary of the Orangeburg Massacre: https://t.co/7JuxQruRWI Proud to support H.R. 840. No veteran should be unable to seek the help they need because they lack access to child care. Healthcare should work for our veterans and not the other way around. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/ryD8pbq9hB Please join me for my first ‚ÄúCoffee with Joe‚Äù this Saturday at Common Ground in Beaufort.  I‚Äôm excited to update everyone on my first month in Washington, as well as hear from you on the issues that matter most.  I look forward to seeing you on Saturday morning! RT @WhipClyburn: This week I reintroduced my Reconstruction Era National Historical Park Act with @RepCunningham.

Led by @RepRaulGrijalva, the Natural Resources Comm‚Ä¶ I have real concerns about the nomination of David Bernhardt as Sec. of the Interior. My first priority is making sure our oceans are safe from dangerous and unwanted oil drilling. How will a former fossil fuel lobbyist be an adequate protector of our vital natural resources? Honored that Mayor Goodwin will be my guest for tomorrow's State of the Union. I am proud to have the bipartisan support of coastal leaders throughout the Lowcountry who recognize the importance of protecting our shores from the devastating effects of oil and gas exploration. https://t.co/5Pl5GlX4nj I stopped by the Art‚Äôs Bar and Grill oyster roast fundraiser for Coast Guard families impacted by the shutdown this  afternoon. Great oysters for a great cause! https://t.co/UqnRefSK1c Director Isaacks + his team gave me a tour of the Ralph Johnson VA Medical Center, they are committed to providing state of the art care for our veterans. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee I am committed to ensuring that Veterans receive high quality and timely care. https://t.co/Re5gDOIjZy This is heartbreaking. Spaces of worship should be sanctuaries.  Next week the House will hold its first hearing on gun violence prevention in eight years. It is far past time for action. https://t.co/5LWoxNO4O7 When you are from the Lowcountry, you live with the consequences of rising sea levels and climate change everyday.

Share your #ClimateChangeImpactsMe story at https://t.co/EbIr2QjJfI https://t.co/IJ5M7ETYFf As we celebrate the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth I hope you take a few moments to watch this important conversation between @WhipClyburn and @RepRichmond. https://t.co/bciU1spMgh "Veterans have sacrificed so much for us, and we want to give them the help they need to again become productive citizens.‚Äù

This is a great development. Part of our duty to our nation's veterans is ensuring they receive the best possible care when they return home. https://t.co/3YmM2Ben0z This morning I spoke on the House floor about a very remarkable group of young children, the James Island Ocean Actkidvists, who successfully lobbied the Charleston and James Island city councils to ban single-use plastics. Thank you Betty, Louis, Mekena, and Liam! https://t.co/XpjxAB8ZdD Reminder: My staff will be hosting satellite office hours TODAY on John‚Äôs Island at the John‚Äôs Island Regional Library (3531 Maybank Hwy) from 11 - 1 PM! Stop by! The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law 10 years ago today. While we celebrate this milestone, we must acknowledge the work that's left do to ensure #EqualPay. Women in the Lowcountry make $0.79 cents on the dollar. That's why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act. Reminder that my staff will be hosting satellite office hours in West Ashley at the Hurd/St. Andrews Regional Library TODAY from 1-3 PM. Stop by and see what we can do for you! My staff will be hosting office hours TOMORROW at the Hurd/St. Andrews Regional Library in West Ashley tomorrow from 1-3 PM.

They will also have office hours on WEDNESDAY at 3531 Maybank Hwy, John‚Äôs Island from 11-1 PM.

Stop by! I‚Äôll be doing a Facebook live at 11:15 AM this morning to talk about the shutdown and where we go from here! Tune in!    https://t.co/sqLpFr0l01 I am relieved that the President has agreed to sign a 3-week C.R. to reopen the government and get federal workers, including the U.S. Coast Guard, paid. Now leadership of both parties need to negotiate a real, permanent solution and make sure this never happens again. There is a LOT going on these days!

https://t.co/XhprwJXg68 Honored to join the House Natural Resources Committee and get to work protecting the Lowcountry's vibrant and vital natural resources. I'm going to use my seat at the table to advance my bipartisan bill placing a moratorium on offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting. ‚ÄúI am made of puzzle pieces.‚Äù Last night, Joshua shared his story here in Washington D.C. Joshua has overcome obstacles, works 60+ hours while in school, and proudly represents our home of Charleston. We are honored to share his story https://t.co/9s8poh9Qhi #WhatWeAreMadeOf https://t.co/LEYyeD5C4c I applaud @RepJoeWilson for taking this stand. Happy to see the positions of our delegation are starting to reflect the consensus in South Carolina. South Carolinians stand united in opposition to offshore drilling. https://t.co/BLUnmGcFmW Global warming is the greatest non-military threat facing our nation. It's clear that there is a consensus among Americans that climate change is not a hoax.  Now we in government need to act. 

https://t.co/LrKOxy2B6S On this day of national unity I had the honor to participate in the @YWCAChasSC MLK Day parade.  As Martin Luther King Jr once said, " We may have all came on different ships, but we are in the same boat now." #MLKDay https://t.co/Scl2LQBX8c Today we honor the life &amp; legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. During this time of major contention throughout our nation, we should look at Dr. King as a guide. From expanding voter participation to ensuring equal rights for all, we still have much to do to carry out his legacy. The House has passed 8 bills that would reopen government and the Senate has refused to vote on any of them. It‚Äôs time for the Senate to do its job and pass a bill to end this shutdown so we can get to work on a real immigration solution. I am glad to see the President express willingness to negotiate on real immigration reform. But we can‚Äôt bring both sides together to find a bipartisan solution that ensures border security and upholds our values while the govt is closed and American families are hurting. Many people view MLK weekend as a "day off" but I view it as a "day on". I began my MLK weekend of service by helping @seaislandHFH build a home for a family in need. https://t.co/VmISMe1VKG This afternoon I had the opportunity to speak with furloughed Federal employees and hear how the government shutdown has impacted their lives. Federal workers should not bear the burden for government dysfunction. https://t.co/3zTBSoQ4Ck Congress is off to a busy start and I want to keep you updated! Make sure you are signed up for my weekly eNewsletter to follow along with my work on behalf of the Lowcountry. Click here to subscribe: https://t.co/XhprwJXg68 This is great news but the Lowcountry needs a more permanent solution to the threat of dangerous and unwanted offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting. Congress needs to pass my bipartisan bill, the Coastal Economies Protection Act ASAP

https://t.co/iHXPsotk49 RT @ABCNews4: "There is no responsibility I will take more seriously." Rep. Joe Cunningham has been assigned a spot on the Veterans Affairs‚Ä¶ read more about it here: https://t.co/OX73xY3btP Some great news to announce! I am humbled by the opportunity to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee with @VetAffairsDems. Honored to be able to advocate for Lowcountry veterans and their families who deserve our unwavering support. And of course @MaryTinklerSC who is leading the charge! South Carolina stands together https://t.co/pDbmfNsJIv Proud of my friends in the statehouse (esp. @leonstav amd @petermccoyforsc) for introducing this bill to protect federal workers. I have co-sponsored similar legislation in DC. Federal workers should never bear the brunt of govt dysfunction 

https://t.co/CRLS0BlHES A deal‚Äôs a deal and tonight @RepByrne followed through with ours after our friendly wager on the Clemson-Alabama game. Can‚Äôt wait to enjoy some of these Alabama brews! #ALLIN https://t.co/ZX8Fd3MeP2 Tonight I voted for emergency disaster relief funding for Americans affected by recent natural disasters. We are still recovering from recent hurricanes and we need to make a serious investment in technology and infrastructure to make the Lowcountry more resilient in the future. Any step towards offshore drilling is a step in the wrong direction. This Administration‚Äôs first priority should be ending the government shutdown, not pursuing dangerous and unwanted seismic air gun blasting. https://t.co/7FYWIuH3cV Members of Congress should be receiving their first paychecks on February 1st. I believe it is unacceptable for Members of Congress to get paid when we haven't done our job and have asked the House Administrator to withhold my paycheck until the shutdown is over. Since then, the House has continued to act, passing multiple individual appropriation bills to re-open vital government agencies. Still the Senate refuses to act.  The fundemental job of Congress is to pass a budget and fund the government. On my very first day in office,  I passed bipartisan legislation to re-open the government. Legislation that the Senate unanimously passed last month. But now they refuse to do the same. Today is the 26th day of the government shutdown. Federal workers have missed paychecks and for the first time ever, servicemembers of the U.S. Coast Guard will not be paid. It is unconscionable. Today I spoke on the House floor in support of H.R. 41, to denounce the racist remarks of Rep. Steve King and condemn white supremacy and white nationalism in all forms. We must strongly condemn hateful expressions of intolerance wherever and whenever we see them. https://t.co/coZO4Somlj I join @WhipClyburn in denouncing these racist and hateful remarks. Hate has no home in America, and certainly not in the halls of Congress. https://t.co/v6A8K0ABlM Celebrating @ClemsonFB at the @WhiteHouse tonight! #ALLIN https://t.co/d06lML0kVk RT @WCBD: .@RepCunningham announced he has co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to pay U.S. Coast Guard members during the government #shutdown.‚Ä¶ RT @NYTNational: Some of the House's new members won on their scientific backgrounds. "'We believe in science' ‚Äî that line always drew appl‚Ä¶ As a former ocean engineer, I‚Äôm proud to bring my STEM background to Congress. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. I promise to stand up for science, facts, and reason in the halls of Congress. https://t.co/F37i1lrVxv Believing in science should never be a radical thing. Proud to be a part of the group changing that culture in Congress.    https://t.co/FVUjyeMUzY Today marks the longest government shutdown in American history and I joined @WCBD to talk about it. On my first day on the job, I voted for a bipartisan series of bills that would reopen the government. I‚Äôll continue to push the Senate to do their job. https://t.co/Kb3DBZc2Do Paying the brave men and women who put their lives in harms way to keep our coastlines safe should never be a partisan issue. Yesterday I cosponsored the Pay our Coast Guard Parity Act to ensure active and reserve members get paid. https://t.co/vlW71ArhRN Making friends when you‚Äôre a freshman is hard and I thought I‚Äôd grease the skids with some Lowcountry beer. Thankfully @RepPeterDeFazio got it in the end! Can I join the beer caucus now? https://t.co/RtW6InDfTK I applaud the decision of the state infrastructure bank to approve a new funding agreement with Charleston Country for I-526, providing vital traffic relief and evacuation routes for West Ashley and John and James Island.   https://t.co/ZZ4OjUJszU I made a promise to my constituents that, if elected, I would work to protect South Carolina's coastlines from offshore drilling. That's why I just introduced my first piece of legislation to ban offshore drilling off the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. https://t.co/3muEdmLS1h Thanks for helping me find my way @RepHoulahan!! https://t.co/cfsytqvcee Today I‚Äôm introducing my first piece of legislation to ban offshore drilling on the Atlantic Coast. But what does that mean and what comes next? Tune into my Facebook Live at 6:30 PM to find out more! RT @MaryCaitlinByrd: Amid shutdown, @RepCunningham promises to file bill banning offshore drilling: "Congress, like the rest of the country‚Ä¶ Honored to be joined by a bipartisan group of local lawmakers and environmental groups as I announce my plans to introduce the Coastal Economies Protection Act which will place a 10 year ban on offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast. https://t.co/utbxYMuvNw I have a very important announcement I'd love to share with y'all. Please tune into my Facebook live at 9:30 AM this morning to find out! 
https://t.co/gtQtd3xjzT South Carolina cannot afford the risk. Our beaches, businesses, and way of life are not for sale. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not just saying no to offshore drilling, I‚Äôm saying hell no to offshore drilling. Deepwater Horizon caused the loss of 11 lives, $62 billion, 10 million user-days of beach, fishing, and boating access, and its impact on fisheries could total almost $9 billion by 2020. And this dangerous process doesn‚Äôt even prove oil deposits exist! Companies still must drill test wells to confirm deposits and determine üí∞. Remember, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy occurred during the tapping of an exploratory well. Since most marine life depend on sound to communicate/navigate, blasts can disrupt basic survival functions. Noise from just ONE airgun can kill off zooplankton, the organism that underpins the entire marine food chain. Blasts need to be loud enough to travel the miles between the ocean floor and a ship - which means they can be heard underwater from about the distance between LA and NYC! But even before you get to the drilling stage, companies must search for oil and gas deposits buried deep under the ocean floor thru a process called seismic airgun blastingüí•. This is an extremely loud and disruptive process. Since 2001, the offshore oil industry has had more than 589 reported oil spills! You hear a lot about offshore drilling, but have you ever wondered why exactly it‚Äôs so harmful? I‚Äôm glad you asked! As a former ocean engineer, I know  how destructive drilling for oil can be to a coastline. Even a small leak can destroy our beaches, economy, and way of life. Looking forward to it! https://t.co/YaFxs46g9B Here‚Äôs to hoping Alabama‚Äôs beer is better than its defense #ALLIN https://t.co/qVx5n2ZgI0 @RepByrne - I‚Äôm looking forward to sampling some of Alabama‚Äôs finest brew! #ALLIN #CFBChampionship https://t.co/712ldGWeb1 Enjoyed talking to @bradrstreicher about @ClemsonFB.
