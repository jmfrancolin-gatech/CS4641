Mr. President, where were you during the humanitarian crisis YOU caused?

I might suggest reading up a little on your Texas history. 

#ComeAndTakeIt https://t.co/rL92nHQaq7 Hey @lopezobrador_ , were you planning on paying over $97 trillion Mexican pesos ($5B USD) to place "steel slats" on the US-MX Border for @realdonaldtrump? No? Didn't think so. Guess these will be "steal slats" since POTUS is trying to steal the funds from American taxpayers. The U.S. must stand with Taiwan - a key democratic ally and friend - and call for a return to peaceful and productive cross-Strait relations. One guac, two guac, three guac, four – shut down the border and guac no more. The Super Bowl is four weeks away. Be smart, Mr. President.

We must be diligent in protecting trade relations with our neighbors. And @realDonaldTrump must exercise the decorum expected from the White House - even from his Twitter account. The American people need to understand that closing the SW border would have terrible implications for American consumers and businesses. If I recall correctly, the biggest threats faced at the US-MX Border this year have been the inhumane policies enacted by the Administration. It is increasingly worrisome that @realDonaldTrump is not kept accountable for his rhetoric - be it online or on any platform. No, Mr. President, you cannot shut down the Southwest Border as a bargaining chip for your useless border wall proposal. https://t.co/vJYwx5TDp4 I have faith in democracy and @senchuckschumer.

I look forward to the support Brick’s will bring to local agribusiness. https://t.co/jo7Ox13HK7 Join me in congratulating @IMASmuseum in McAllen, Texas on being awarded a $10,000 grant from @NEAarts. Approximately 30,000 children visit IMAS annually to be immersed in a world of art, culture, and exploration. I am pleased to see the U.S., Canada, and Mexico come to an agreement on how to update NAFTA. I look forward to analyzing the text of #USMCA and bringing certainty and opportunity to farm operators, energy producers, workers, and small businesses in #TX15 As #NAFTA negotiations continue to take place, I look forward to creating a meaningful relationship between @lopezobrador_ and @mayordarling to have two neighbors live harmoniously and productively.

I would like to commend @Univision for coming in as the top Spanish-language network for the 26th consecutive season in primetime. Both Univision and @Telemundo continue to provide quality television to Spanish-speaking individuals, but what’s a little competition, right? https://t.co/kERVjfnrY9 I would like to thank the @TheJusticeDept for investing almost $180,000 in Texas’ sector of the Community Policing Development Program. This funding will help @NLCharities and @TxDPS attain success in everything they do across Texas! I would like to thank @ExxonMobil, @Chevron, and @OXY_Petroleum for their commitment to address climate change and ensure responsible domestic energy production.

This funding will allow the city to hire an expected 12 new firefighters. https://t.co/MV6JmOhqSd The Speaker of the House should govern the entire House, not appease partisan favorability. I support my fellow Problem Solvers Caucus members seeking to break the gridlock and truly work for Americans. Together, we can bridge the gap and get back to work for the American people. The voices of residents in #TX15 deserve to be heard. This starts with Leadership that is willing to embrace bipartisanship and abandon Rules that favor the few. Our next Speaker should support #ProblemSolvers efforts to break the gridlock and return power to the people. Recently, I returned from a bipartisan congressional delegation to Asia. We traveled to Japan, Hong Kong, China, and South Korea to discuss intellectual property protections and market access for American businesses and the importance of denuclearizing North Korea. https://t.co/ePJTfT7SFR Our legislation seeks to stop these inexcusable actions and end undue discrimination against Americans in South Texas and across the country.

These confidential support options are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We need to do more to support our troops in every way possible. If you are a veteran, or know one who is in need in counseling, I urge you to contact the Veterans Crisis Line. To speak with a responder by phone, call 1-800-273-8255 and Press 1. More than 34,000 veterans call the 15th District of Texas their home. There should be no reason – not one – for a veteran to feel so isolated from their own community that they take their own life. This week is #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek and I believe it crucial that we be more vocal and supportive of those who have protected this country – veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. https://t.co/ZJixJMiqoc I would like to thank Wounded Warrior Fellow/Caseworker, Sgt. Patrick Roberts, for presenting a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition at @PSJAISD SW Early College HS’s 9/11 memorial ceremony.

I give my full backing to Dr. Maestre and her team to support and enrich the well-being of every American. https://t.co/YKGC9lECgw No U.S. citizen should ever endure questioning about the nature of their birth. Our legislation seeks to stop these inexcusable actions and end undue discrimination against Americans in South Texas and across the country. H.R. 6707 would prevent the @StateDept from: 

- Creating an argument, solely to question the authenticity of documents, based on the aforementioned criteria. H.R. 6707 would prevent the @StateDept from: 

- Denying or flagging individuals for citizenship questioning, even in presence a midwife birth certificate, without substantial evidence. H.R. 6707 would prevent the @StateDept from: 

- Judging an individual on the basis of race/ethnicity/ancestry during the passport application. I have joined @RepEspaillat/@RepJimmyGomez to introduce the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Improvement Act '18 after reports that the @StateDept has been questioning the citizenship/nationality of U.S. citizens along the US-MX Border applying/re-applying for U.S. passports. Not only does paid maternity leave have immense benefits on child health outcomes, but it can also increase female labor force participation by allowing women to stay in the workforce after giving birth. As of 2015, only 12% of U.S. private sector workers had access to paid family leave through their employer. I support workplace rights because they allow our nation’s economy to grow and provide essential care to newborns in their first months of life.

Family values are essential to the very fabric of our nation, and hardworking women across the U.S. deserve the support they need to be mothers in the work force. https://t.co/pEOOGpiMyi U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Timothy A. Bolyard selflessly upheld the peace, security, and prosperity of this great nation during his 13 tours of duty with the U.S. Army.
