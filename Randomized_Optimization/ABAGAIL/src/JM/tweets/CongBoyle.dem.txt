Great article on a few iconic Philadelphians for #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/W56F908gb1 It's astonishing that in 2019 women still make 80 cents on a man's dollar, and even less for women of color. Proud to cosponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the legal loopholes that let employers get away with that. #EqualPayForEqualWork RT @BlueCollarDems: ICYMI: @congboyle and @RepVeasey wrote about how an infrastructure package could not only improve our roads and bridges… Every person -- no matter their income, race, gender, or zip code -- deserves to live a life free of sexual harassment. https://t.co/kJc1CKYzDr .@NASA determined 2018 was the 4th hottest year on record – meaning the last 5 years have been the 5 hottest ever.
Climate change is not a hoax or some distant threat – we’re already seeing record damage from hurricanes and wildfires. 
(Not one mention in the #SOTU on Tues) Today @WaysMeansCmte began seeking a copy of President Trump's tax returns. The only president in modern history not to disclose, yet he has the most complicated web of financial interests. Given the #CultureofCorruption he's built, we must do our duty and demand transparency. Never have I seen more compelling evidence that the time to act on #climatechange is now. There is no time to play politics – to pretend that climate change isn’t real.

We need good-paying jobs. #SOTU 90% of heroin, 88% of cocaine, 87% of meth, and 80% of fentanyl come through legal ports of entry. A wall would not address this whatsoever. #SOTU The #TrumpShutdown cost the economy $11B, 800K federal workers their salaries, and countless people their critical government services.
I’m determined not to let the President hold our country hostage over his reckless, radical demands again. #SOTU President Trump continues to lie about his tax scam.
The expert consensus is that it didn’t create new jobs or raise wages.
It prompted stock buybacks and CEO bonuses that padded the pockets of our country’s billionaires. #SOTU The stock market may be strong, but President Trump is missing the point: Working people’s wages are stagnant.
He needs to stop giving handouts to millionaires and billionaires and instead create good jobs for everyday Americans #SOTU The President says he’s focused on national security, but his policies over the past two years embolden our adversaries, undermine our relationships with allies, and make America less safe. #SOTU RT @SenatorCollett: Thank you to @RepDean @CongBoyle,  and @RepBrianFitz for penning this thoughtful editorial and being leaders in address… In less than an hour, this same person calling people "dumb" and "SOB's" will preach "unity" to the nation at the #SOTU2019 https://t.co/vWepVX2NHo Happy Lunar New Year to all who celebrate!

Yesterday, I was proud to vote to give federal workers the raise they're owed. These public servants, especially after enduring a month of the #TrumpShutdown, deserve fair wages. House Democrats tried to pass a simple, non-binding, symbolic resolution that government shutdowns are bad for the country.

Today, 800k federal workers are losing their second paycheck. That's one month with zero income.

I've joined @SenWarren+others to create that world with the Accountable Capitalism Act. https://t.co/aRtwHPNdma https://t.co/ExCf8j8PUm “I believe this can be a win for everybody, and we can preserve part of what makes 30th Street Station so special ... and not go down the tragic path New York went with Penn Station that in no way compares to Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station." https://t.co/sLvRYiaaR6 Bureaucratic red tape isn't just a headache – it can cost people their livelihoods, their health, and even their lives. Pennsylvanians with disabilities face some of the worst barriers to Social Security. @SenBobCasey and I joined together to fix it. https://t.co/es2u4UfMAc 2018 was the worst year EVER for school gun violence. It's a disgrace that the GOP majority refused to acknowledge this epidemic, especially one that kills children. With the new Dem. majority, we will push for commonsense gun violence prevention measures. https://t.co/6tCepAmsSi Thanks to everyone in Philadelphia who committed acts of kindness, big or small, this past year. It may have been a hard year for some, but when we come together and work with our neighbors for what we believe in, we can make things a little bit better. https://t.co/YqjNJqq5uU Tens of thousands of Vietnam vets who have Agent Orange-related health problems can't get the health care they need and deserve because of administrative issues. Proud to lead a bipartisan group of Congressmembers to fix it: https://t.co/AejpZEaCMJ The right to vote is absolutely central to the health of our democracy, and many of our citizens — especially people of color — have been shut out for far too long. Glad to see Pennsylvania may make reforms in the right direction. https://t.co/Y8ucVjpgBq The #GOPTaxScam was supposed to raise wages. One year later, we know the reality: layoffs, stock buybacks, and soaring CEO pay. https://t.co/dGn0LOOhL0 This is still sinking in. People are dying of gun violence in record numbers, and we need commonsense reforms to stop it. https://t.co/oHy8ZJh5qC Furious that so many workers in Philly are struggling because of the #TrumpShutdown. 
The Senate must agree to the deal they passed last term, which the House passed last night. We must ensure people can access government services and our workers get paid. https://t.co/1DVPoWJ6Y5 Proud that the new Democratic majority's first major act will be to protect our democracy. From voter suppression to wealthy special interests hijacking our elections, there's a lot to fix. Ready to get to work and fight #ForThePeople. RT @RepSarbanes: .@HouseDemocrats are making good on our promise to fight the culture of corruption in Washington &amp; protect our democracy f… Great meeting Disney star and activist @JoshuaRush in my office today!
I think my daughter Abby liked it too. https://t.co/jC8j87PGyi 2018 was a busy year, but I hope 2019 will be even more so. 
Thanks to all the constituents who contacted my office with an opinion, a question, or for help. I look forward to hearing from you again in this coming year. And as always, it is an honor to represent and serve you. https://t.co/pT4NORtCXQ Thrilled that my wife Jenny and daughter Abby could join me for today's inauguration! Ready to get to work in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/7zQrZodJLH Tomorrow, the Democrats will enter the House majority.
Ready to get to work and fight for affordable health care, better jobs, and a more fair, transparent democracy #ForThePeople! RT @krassenstein: BREAKING: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union just filed a lawsuit against the Trump Admin for f… Wishing everyone in Pennsylvania and across the world a wonderful 2019! I hope the next year brings you plenty of blessings and cheer. https://t.co/nd054X4H3H It's day 10 of the #TrumpShutdown. Because of @realDonaldTrump's ransom demanding an ineffective, unpopular border wall, we're facing: 
-worse public+food safety
-closed ntl parks
-less farmer support
-less sanction enforcement
-fewer small biz loans+mortgages
-fewer exports Shameful that @realDonaldTrump and the GOP are leaving nearly a million federal workers without pay over the holidays. These dedicated public servants – including 47K law enforcement officers and firefighters – deserve much better. As we enter day 8 of the #TrumpShutdown, I'd like to remind my colleagues what their last shutdown stunt cost us: 120,000 jobs and $24 billion. Is it really worth it for an expensive, ineffective, unpopular border wall? As an elected Member of Congress, I represent all Americans, and all federal employees regardless of their personal politics.  It’s my sworn duty.  

It’s sad the President can’t find it within himself to do the same. https://t.co/M4xOtu1ObJ President Trump decides to kick all federal employees when they’re down with partisan attacks.  To diminish the crucial role our federal employees play with partisan accusations is just insulting and grossly uninformed. In less than a week, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives. Focused and excited to get to work fighting for affordable health care, better jobs, and a more fair, transparent democracy #ForThePeople! Sending wishes of a Happy Kwanzaa to all who celebrate! I hope your next seven nights give you time to reflect on your heritage and the incredible contributions people of African descent have made around the world. https://t.co/MWIzHnRtDF Wishing a very Merry Christmas to Pennsylvania families and those all across this great nation. May your day be filled with family, love, and a healthy dose of cheer. https://t.co/0jdT2yygnt Christmas Eve is a great time to give back to your community! No act is too small or too large. Some ideas for how to get into the giving spirit, here: https://t.co/TKWr9ZEHGt Hope everyone has a warm and safe Christmas Eve surrounded by family and friends. Take some time to reflect on all that you have to be grateful for this year, and how you could help someone who has not been as lucky. https://t.co/FDMN9bpueD About to go LIVE on @MSNBC with @AlexWitt to talk about the #TrumpShutdown and topics of the day—TUNE IN! “President Trump said he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government, so right now he is probably beaming while thousands of government workers scramble to feed their families, buy holiday gifts and pay household bills without their hard earned paychecks. “
#TrumpShutDown https://t.co/cfXuFQcuP0 "Never before has one party held the House, the Senate, and the White House yet been so stunningly unable to pass budgets that keep the government open.  Again, our President who claims to “make the best deals” has failed miserably in his constitutional duty" https://t.co/kDZYd5WJKB Thank you to everyone who has expressed their concern to my office, and please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or comments on this or any other matter. I was appalled by President Trump’s actions changing the rule, and have signed onto the House bill supporting net neutrality. You can see that here: https://t.co/0O6y1KbuR9

In less than 2 weeks, Dems will take over the House and I’m confident we’ll pass the net neutrality bill. My office has been receiving a lot of calls regarding my position on net neutrality so I’d like to clear up any confusion: 

I’m in favor of a free and open internet. Today's the last day for @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP to fund the govt and avert a shutdown. Their last chance to listen to the American ppl: avoid a self-inflicted economic blow and say no to the President’s ransom. No expensive, ineffective, unpopular border wall. #GOPShutdown I applaud @PhillyMayor Jim Kenney for making $15/hour minimum wage the law in the City of Philadelphia. #RaisetheWage #FightFor15 #ForThePeople https://t.co/bf1gxeacvS Though the weather may look more like fall, I hope everyone has a good, safe start to their winter season!  https://t.co/AMkgeRLtLV And--Under the #TrumpShutdown , nearly 400,000 Federal Employees Will Be Furloughed Without Pay During the Holidays.
