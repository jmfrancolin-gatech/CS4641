Last night on @AC360 I discussed the on-the-ground impact of this shutdown and our bipartisan efforts to reopen the government. https://t.co/NozsYNYVSl A view of the Capitol this morning beautifully lit from the east.

But we can‚Äôt have this discussion with a shutdown hanging over our head. To start, let's open the government. https://t.co/XxCn7cJaCh To these local banks, credit unions, and all others who‚Äôve stepped up to help the workers who are hurting: thank you. You are the reason that Maine is such a special place to live. And I‚Äôll keep working to make your spirit a little more common in Washington. Amidst this ridiculous and painful shutdown, we‚Äôve seen the Maine spirit shine through as community members support those in need. One important example: our financial institutions, who have offered low- or no-interest loans to affected federal workers. https://t.co/ocGHcSkDtu Heartened to see Maine people like Michele Richardson step up for her community during hard times, but even more discouraged that the President‚Äôs strategy (or lack thereof) has led us to this point.

That provision is one of the important steps we can take to help fight back and protect our most vulnerable, but we can't stop there. I spoke with the folks at @PineTreeWatchME about this bill, and how to combat the opioid crisis in Maine‚Äôs communities: https://t.co/xiFOGK7wLw Thankfully, help is on the way. The Senate passed bipartisan opioid legislation in October with provisions like the CRIB Act ‚Äì which I introduced ‚Äì to allow Medicaid to cover babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome in pediatric recovery centers. The opioid epidemic spares no one, not even our newborns. There are hospitals in rural Maine where 10, 12 or 15 percent of the babies were born with addicted to opioids ‚Äì an absolutely heartbreaking statistic that must be addressed. Another example of this government shutdown hurting Maine people ‚Äì this time, our state‚Äôs disabled community. This needs to end ‚Äì let‚Äôs reopen the government. https://t.co/J5CGQAcpRb To watch the full version of 2013 remarks, click here: https://t.co/QML4s5sQtc On August 28, 1963, I attended the March on Washington where Dr. King delivered his historic #IHaveaDream speech to 250,000 people.

As I‚Äôve said before: ultimately, the best way to help these men and women is to reopen the government ‚Äì and we must do so immediately. Federal contractor employees are not responsible for this shutdown, and they should not be punished for it.

By simplifying and isolating critical pieces of infrastructure that help run our grid, economy, health care system and more, we can defend against crippling attacks. For years, bad actors have been testing American systems for weaknesses, and over time their incursions have grown more sophisticated and more threatening. But even as the danger becomes more clear, our government response has been lacking. Major progress to protect America‚Äôs national security overnight! Last night, the Senate passed the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act, my bill with @SenatorRisch that will help reduce digital vulnerabilities in our energy grid and protect our vital infrastructure from hackers. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve joined with @SenRobPortman, @SenAlexander, and @MarkWarner to introduce the Restore Our Parks Act, which would address the maintenance backlog in a fiscally responsible way. It‚Äôs bipartisan, and it‚Äôs necessary‚Äì so let‚Äôs pass it.

Whether it‚Äôs a coffee, a book, or a gift for the upcoming holiday season, be sure to #ShopLocal today (and everyday!) We‚Äôre staring a threat in the face ‚Äî let‚Äôs recognize it, and come together to remedy it in a way that will protect our planet for generations of future Americans. Now is not the time for denials, excuses, or equivocation ‚Äî now is the time for action. #mepolitics This report is clear: climate change is already making an impact on our lives, with many more obvious consequences coming in the near future. If we don‚Äôt act now, we will be grossly failing ourselves and our children. #mepolitics https://t.co/flErUxapGv For a preview of things I‚Äôll be giving thanks for at our Thanksgiving table this year, read my full Medium post here. https://t.co/UqFHlEFRVB Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt just about turkey and Maine blueberry pie ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the opportunity to spend time with family and reflect upon the blessings we have each been given. On this day of gratitude, family, and yes ‚Äî food ‚Äî I wish you and yours a #HappyThankgiving! Had some fun telling Maine Calling about my five (ok, six) favorite records of all time. A lot of opportunities for debate here, but one thing is non-negotiable ‚Äî Moondance by Van Morrison belongs at the top of any list. Now your turn ‚Äî #WhichAreYourFive? https://t.co/7JA70R07in After an eventful year, and with Thanksgiving just around the corner, I took a moment to reflect and take stock of all the things I have to be grateful for. Read my full post on @Medium: https://t.co/32eT1cXZPo A slow internet connection isn‚Äôt a minor annoyance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a challenge to a region‚Äôs growth. With high-speed broadband‚Äôs growing importance, it‚Äôs essential that rural Maine communities can improve their broadband infrastructure to create new economic and educational opportunities. Great news for communities around Maine! Three rural regions ‚Äì Millinocket, Windham and the Blue Hill Peninsula ‚Äì will join @Neighborly to expand their broadband efforts and help Maine people access affordable, high-speed internet. The USS Thresher, built at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, carried 129 men when it tragically sank off the coast of New England in 1963. My colleagues and I are pushing for a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery honoring their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/iIzICh6Slx Some cool innovation in the works at UMaine ‚Äì by using a wood-plastic biobased mixture and a massive 3-D printer, boat builders may be able to reduce costs and construction time, improve the product, and strengthen the future of Maine‚Äôs forest economy. https://t.co/mQ6gWC5Ncu On #WorldPancreaticCancerDay, we should all take a moment to remember those who have been afflicted by this terrible disease‚Äì which is the 2nd deadliest cancer in Maine ‚Äì raise awareness of its awful impact, and #DemandBetter early detection strategies and treatment options. On National #RuralHealth Day, I‚Äôd like to express my gratitude to the men and women across Maine who work so hard to keep their communities healthy. Your work is so vital, and I‚Äôll keep fighting to help you innovate and improve healthcare for rural Maine people. #mepolitics A long drive to the doctor can be a major challenge to taking care of your health ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs for a simple check-up or for a life-or-death medical emergency. That‚Äôs why #RuralHealth providers are so important to rural communities across Maine. #mepolitics RT @SenatorLeahy: Sen. McConnell and others still argue there‚Äôs no need yet for our bill to protect the Special Counsel investigation. @Sen‚Ä¶ I'll be on with @mitchellreports shortly -- hope you can tune in! RT @SenMarkey: Whereas, the 2018 @RedSox are one of the greatest teams ever assembled.

Thank you to everyone who joined me and @SenWarren‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Travis's story, the work he and his team do to help wounded veterans, or the way the community has embraced their efforts, listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/MeyU3xsLAJ Last year, I was lucky enough to speak to Travis on my Inside Maine podcast ‚Äì what a pleasure, because honestly, Travis is the most inspiring person I've ever met. In the face of adversity, his indomitable spirit continues to radiate courage, optimism, warmth, and humor. https://t.co/ZXhOUZukwU For those of you who haven‚Äôt had the pleasure to meet Travis, let me tell you ‚Äî he‚Äòs the real deal. Earlier this year, Mary and I visited the Foundation‚Äôs Retreat in Rome; we were so impressed by the work they‚Äôre doing, and so proud they‚Äôve made Maine their home. https://t.co/F8uPohbiYF Phenomenal news! A woman from Iowa who recently won the lottery announced on @TheEllenShow that she will donate $500,000 to the Travis Mills Foundation (@ssgtravismills), a Maine-based organization that helps wounded veterans and their families heal. https://t.co/YrKh17c3tl The U.S. Coast Guard in Maine is always ready to respond to emergencies, and thanks to their professionalism and preparation, four fishermen are safe tonight. We‚Äôre grateful for their service, today and everyday. https://t.co/tejgO5KtGA We have a bipartisan bill that could be brought to the floor this afternoon to allow Director Special Counsel Mueller to finish his investigation, so let‚Äôs do it. I just don‚Äôt understand what the delay is. On @NewDay this morning, I talked about the importance of protecting the Mueller investigation ‚Äì particularly in light of the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the Acting Attorney General, who may try to limit the scope of, or cut the funding for, Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs work. https://t.co/mBGNHdm5Fo TUNE IN: I‚Äôll be joining @NewDay shortly. Back to DC today ‚Äì truly honored by the faith the people of Maine have placed in me, and more determined than ever to fight for them. There‚Äôs so much important work left to be done, and I‚Äôll give my all to make sure Washington‚Äôs actions reflect Maine‚Äôs priorities. https://t.co/02qnQeE3oU On this #VeteransDay, it is my privilege to recognize and thank all of the men and women who have served in our armed forces for their commitment to our country. https://t.co/Ouu7A351oL We owe our veterans so much, and Messalonskee‚Äôs annual Veterans Tribute Assembly not only shows how grateful we are, but also teaches students about our duty to care for veterans. A truly special experience ‚Äî one that I won‚Äôt soon forget. A powerful day yesterday in Oakland, where Messalonskee Middle School students brought in veterans from the community to honor them for their service. It was my honor to speak at this year‚Äôs event. https://t.co/uuYPsKqkgI This new Congress can enact common sense gun safety legislation to protect our citizens. Here are some of the proposals I support: https://t.co/ntVHVUb0wA Yet another senseless, devastating mass shooting. I‚Äôm praying for the victims in California and grateful for the quick actions of the first responders. 

This is simply wrong. Americans deserve to feel safe at music venues, and at schools, and at places of worship, and at‚Ä¶ The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a bipartisan bill, which I support, that would protect the special counsel‚Äôs probe. I urge Leader McConnell to bring this bill to the floor so we can ensure Director Mueller can continue to follow the facts wherever they lead. Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation must not be compromised ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs cutting off funding for the investigation or an outright termination of it.

With only six weeks to sign up, there‚Äôs no time to waste ‚Äì please, follow this link to a checklist that will help prepare you to find the healthcare plan that works for you. #mepolitics https://t.co/dgeTXBJVlH It‚Äôs always good to celebrate a bipartisan victory that helps both Maine workers and American service members, but the real celebration today should be for these hardworking NB employees who make these high-quality products. They are why Maine is so special. #mepolitics https://t.co/1ItCK4LyIR At the New Balance plant this morning, we celebrated a recent bipartisan legislative victory to extend the Berry Amendment ‚Äî which requires products for military recruits to be made in America ‚Äî to athletic footwear like the kind made right here in Norridgewock. #mepolitics https://t.co/2PBG1ofu3z Devastated to hear that another house of worship ‚Äî a place for faith and community ‚Äî has been hurt by such a heinous attack. My first reaction is heartbreak for the victims in Pittsburgh and their families. Unused prescription drugs may look harmless gathering dust in your medicine cabinet, but these pills could be a dangerous gateway to opioid abuse. If you have unwanted medications bring them to a drug collection site near you from 10 am to 2 pm today. https://t.co/WEcqUMTci0 The forest products industry has been a vital part of rural Maine for generations. Great to see so many members of this great Maine industry in Bangor and Dover-Foxcroft making investments and working to further this cornerstone of rural Maine communities. Maine‚Äôs forest products industry is thriving thanks to the folks at places like Pleasant River Lumber ‚Äî and it will continue to do so thanks to the forward-thinking leadership of the industry and community officials involved in the FOR/Maine Initiative. https://t.co/XEfUdspthb RT @MarissaWGME: On today's violent threats toward Democrats, Sen.

Glad to see @Beth_Brogan report that it will continue to play a part in Brunswick! https://t.co/wAP4N6nsLD This proposal has strong bipartisan support, and for good reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs a commonsense answer that will increase transparency in prescription drug pricing and lower costs for consumers, addressing a serious challenge facing millions of Americans. #mepolitics Great news ‚Äì this proposed rule from CMS would create drug price transparency requirements similar to a proposal I‚Äôve pushed with @SenatorDurbin and @ChuckGrassley. It‚Äôs simple, really: Maine people should know how much their drugs will cost. #mepolitics https://t.co/Kvv7kKfoJd This is not who we are ‚Äì as a state or as a nation. Regardless of any political differences, @SenatorCollins, her family, and her staff should not have to be subjected to these threats ‚Äì there‚Äôs just no place for it in our discourse. https://t.co/K0Xq7qygrb #mepolitics Great event at Togus today, helping homeless veterans connect with resources to help them find housing. There are so many volunteers in Maine who work hard to give our veterans the support they have earned ‚Äî today helped connect those in need with those who can help. #mepolitics https://t.co/84wtGewabY Maine‚Äôs farmers have a long and proud tradition of producing superior agricultural products, from dairy and potatoes to blueberries and hops. They are as resilient and innovative as the generations that came before them, and I'm proud to recognize them on #NationalFarmersDay. https://t.co/sHlcvCKel0 These funds will help treatment providers address the challenges related to this epidemic. They won‚Äôt solve every problem, but they are a step in the right direction, and I won‚Äôt stop fighting until Maine communities have the tools they need to end this scourge once and for all. Across Maine, I hear stories of heartbreak stemming from the opioid epidemic that are both unique and familiar. No community is immune from this pain; they need help, and I'm glad to say that help is coming in the form of $5 million in federal grants. https://t.co/7Tstidq6T4
