People are afraid of losing their homes or not being able to pay their bills, and all b/c Trump is using federal workers as leverage for his ineffective and expensive border wall. #TrumpShutdown The majority of suspected terrorists enter the U.S. through airports, not the southern border. The best way to root them out is a well-funded, well-trained @TSA and @CBP – too bad @RealDonaldTrump is forcing them to work without pay for the duration of the #TrumpShutdown. The majority of drugs smuggled into the U.S. come through legal ports of entry. Instead of spending $5B on a wall that will do little-to-nothing to stop drug flow into the US, we could spend that money on much-needed resources to support our border agents. #TrumpShutdown While Trump &amp; his Mar-a-Lago cronies might like walls around their mansions, a border wall will be an expensive, wasteful, &amp; ineffective use of taxpayer funds.

Everyone, say hello to Mandy!  #RescueDogs https://t.co/U6YHYRRGME The Senate just passed a bill to restore #NetNeutrality and keep  the internet open, free and fair for everybody. Now the bill heads to the House, where I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill. #SaveTheInternet RT @TransportDems: Ranking Member @RepPeterDeFazio sat down w/ @BGOV to discuss #InfrastructureWeek and his priorities including:

Today, he announced a proposal that does nothing to address drug pricing, but sends drug company stocks soaring: https://t.co/a2fx1hNacd The Trump Administration has scrapped the CFPB's Office for Students and Young Consumers -- the only office in the ENTIRE federal government devoted to protecting student loan borrowers. There's truly no limit to how low Trump will go in order to protect his corporate cronies. While far from perfect, the #IranDeal was negotiated by a broad coalition of our allies and moved us towards the goal of keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Today, we heard Trump offer many criticisms but no solutions to fill the void left by the U.S.'s exit.

Trump was elected by promising to overhaul our broken trade policies - We've seen nothing but bluster for the past 16 months. Another day, another broken promise. Got a big thank you from crewmembers Ursula, Susan, Lorretta and Barbara from @AlaskaAir, photographer Veda, and @AFA_CWA for including a requirement in last week's #FAA bill that flight attendants get at least 10 hours of rest time between duty periods.✋🏻🤚🏻 https://t.co/k5mAHgnAJN RT @TransportDems: Watch Ranking Member @RepPeterDeFazio’s statement on H.R.4, the bipartisan #FAA Reauthorization Act✈️: https://t.co/XtNd… I just introduced a bill banning any paper products imported from countries that refuse to meet the U.S.'s high environmental standards. It's only fair that our trade partners follow same standards that U.S. producers adhere to. Quarterly reports are in, showing that the #GOPTaxScam was a huge gift to Wall Street--the U.S. is borrowing $20 BILLION to pay for massive handouts to the biggest banks: https://t.co/t0ZwNBBlf0 With climate change-deniers like President Trump and Scott Pruitt at the helm, it's more important than ever before to do all we can to protect and preserve our planet for future generations #EarthDay2018 Visiting the beautiful South Coast today! https://t.co/nq9aFst8jm Welcomed my colleagues @RepGarretGraves and @RepHuffman to Coos Bay today. After a roundtable discussion on the need for investment in water resources, I took them out with the @USCG to show them the issue firsthand! https://t.co/9aKW0vfKUP I've repeatedly pushed Trump to bring a WTO challenge against OPEC for their blatant manipulation of oil prices. Let’s take action and stand up for American consumers: https://t.co/VnzZefMQHn Even Defense Secretary Mattis urged President Trump to seek congressional approval before the recent strikes in Syria. It’s beyond time for Congress to stand up to the presidency and defend its war powers granted in the Constitution. #VoteOnWar https://t.co/4znqAnsMmL After working with BLM and Coos County for many years, I’m pleased to announce Bastendorff Beach will be transitioning to a day use only site.

We ought to be moving away from the failed trade policies of the past and working towards a fair trade plan that would protect both workers and consumers.

https://t.co/8nluSsVSPa On average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. This is not just a women’s issue.

https://t.co/fltwLe5Tgf Had a good and productive meeting with the interim VARHS Director Dave Whitmer. He briefed me on positive changes being made to improve management and patient care across the VA healthcare system in SW Oregon. Pleased to see real change happening. https://t.co/hNcKFPjH2L "The tax bill was sold as a way to create jobs and boost stagnant wages. So far, at least, corporations have been showing more concern about shareholders than about employees or the economy as a whole." https://t.co/6UTuAl9vKb Elsie and Sophie, our DC office dogs, are proud to announce that I've been named a @HumaneSociety Legislative Champion with a 100% rating!  

(They also say, "We'd like some treats, please.") https://t.co/gSJqrU9nVG Today I met with the American Legion Department of Oregon to talk about policies that support and protect Oregon's veterans. https://t.co/R0Dj9pcoqj Without #NetNeutrality, big corporations could have an unfair advantage over small businesses online. They deserve a level playing field. #SaveTheInternet I am joining 149 of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation that will #SaveTheInternet. #NetNeutrality means consumers — not big corporations— choose what websites and applications we see online. #SaveTheInternet Three months after President Trump signed the #GOPTaxScam into law, the results are in -- Investors and wealthy shareholders are reaping tremendous financial benefits while working families get very little: https://t.co/XDRgUBN7Xw I visited the Eugene airport today to check out the brand-new TSA PreCheck lane and also got to visit the control tower. We need to ensure that TSA has the funding it needs to ensure that our airport runs as safely and efficiently as possible. https://t.co/EkGwlLOGvO On February 14, 1859, Oregon joined the union. Happy Birthday to the Beaver State!

https://t.co/EfpoeA0fTM https://t.co/QmgwpIxQuE Valentine’s Day is one of the biggest tip days for workers, but President Trump is proposing a rule allowing employers to pocket worker’s tips - nearly $6 BILLION each year.

It just hit a record high. I'm tired of all this winning, aren't you? A PA woman sees $1.50 increase in her weekly paycheck. Compare that to people who earn more than $500k, who will see $400+ each week. Everyone's share of the massive deficit created by the #GOPTaxScam is $4,600. Does Speaker Ryan think that's fair? While President Trump shilled for the #GOPTaxScam and celebrated massive tax cuts for the wealthy today in Ohio, the Dow dropped more than 1500 points. He takes credit for its rise -- when do you think we'll hear him take credit for its fall? Devin Nunes has made it clear that he cannot remain non-partisan in his role as House Intel Chairman. I'm calling on Speaker Ryan to immediately remove him from his position &amp; ensure the Ethics Committee begins a thorough investigation into the misuse of his leadership role. https://t.co/EGPu6Fmtms President Trump loves to brag about his accomplishments -- I wonder when  we'll hear about the "tremendous" drop in the Dow (665 points) and the "HUGE" effect it'll have on the economy. This week, I read the controversial memo authored by House Intel Chairman Nunes. While I cannot go into details about the contents, I can say that it was a highly-partisan document that compromises national security in order to protect President Trump: https://t.co/Yfu32o69j7 My statement on the resignation of VARHS Director Doug Paxton: https://t.co/YxqRdL0vo7 I was disappointed with President Trump's pandering, platitudes and props in tonight's #SOTU.

The GOP needs to get their act together, do their job, and properly fund the government for an entire year: https://t.co/n1gg9EuFAd If House GOP is *actually* worried about the Children's Health Insurance Program, why have they let it remain unfunded since September? 🤔 22,000 individuals apply for Social Security and Medicare every day -- but their applications will be delayed until the #TrumpShutdown ends. President Trump, it's time to stop watching TV and do your job to end this Republican logjam. The most basic function of the majority party -- particularly one that controls the House, Senate and White House -- is to write a budget that keeps the government open. GOP, you're 113 days late and it’s harming transportation, job creation and troop readiness: https://t.co/kw9T14Gf51 The #TrumpShutdown is already impacting thousands of Oregonians - Community Health Centers, which serve 30,000 in Lane County alone, are unfunded. GOP leaders MUST stop pointing fingers and find a solution to this mess.
