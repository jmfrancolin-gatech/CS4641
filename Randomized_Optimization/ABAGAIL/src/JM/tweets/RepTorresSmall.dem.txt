#Route66 has a special place in my district. It inspired countless TV shows, movies, and songs and continues to attract visitors today, bringing important tourism to our smaller, rural communities. Proud to support H.R. 66! üöó https://t.co/5C8kWxm0LE I am so excited to have Arlean Murillo join me for tonight‚Äôs #SOTU! An amazing advocate for her community, she held a food drive w/ @BpaFamily for federal workers affected by the #governmentshutdown https://t.co/wNYiRYgZGP Excited to share that my #SOTU guest is NM-02 constituent Arlean Murillo. A tireless advocate for her community and wife of a #USBP Agent, Arlean helped organize a food drive for local fed employees during the gov #shutdown  

https://t.co/x80QOBHQF0 That‚Äôs why I joined 160 of my colleagues to send a letter to @DepSecDef Shanahan asking him to allow transgender troops to continue to openly serve, and will fight the implementation of this discriminatory policy as a member of @HASCDemocrats #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/oe4JleBhr1 There are nearly 14,7000 transgender service members that stood up and took an oath to protect our freedom and ideals. In return we should be providing our gratitude, not stigmatization. https://t.co/uoqiP3KIsU As the only Member of the @HomelandDems that represents a district on the southern border, I‚Äôm proud to be named Chair of the OMA Subcommittee. Looking forward to finding real solutions to strengthen our border security.

https://t.co/v7VMQW6lHO Do you agree it‚Äôs time to end shutdowns forever? The SEAS Act will put an end to future shutdowns and protect hardworking Americans. #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact Read more here: https://t.co/qxytbgcymc @USCBO estimates the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion. Below is my statement. You can read the full CBO report here: https://t.co/zFTBE418ly https://t.co/csYilFiDEO I believe in investing in smart, proven border security measures like the ones I had the opportunity to talk with Border Patrol Agents &amp; Customs Officers on the ground about this weekend. Things like better radar, more manpower at our ports, and medical &amp; personnel training https://t.co/YMzDvCOBVu Stopped in Socorro on my way home this weekend. It was great to see so many come out to discuss the community‚Äôs challenges and opportunities. I look forward to spending more time there soon! https://t.co/3G6FgzykqB Thank you to all those who participated in the food drive for federal employees in Sunland Park yesterday. It is so inspiring to see a community rally around its neighbors. https://t.co/ek4TNYSs6J The most critical time for wildfire prevention work is right now. The Forest Service &amp; BIA Wildland Fire Management teams have to wait b/c of the #governmentshutdown. If we don't work together now, NM will feel the effects of this long after it ends

https://t.co/Fq9lkk4YYV Thanks to all who joined me last weekend in Deming! Challenges facing rural communities need to be a priority for both parties in this Congress.  Looking forward to another few days at home this weekend

https://t.co/93eXH10fED Only a #bipartisan effort will end the #governmentshutdown.   Yesterday, I along with other colleagues, called on the leadership of both parties to come together, end the shutdown, and commit to finding long term solutions to the real challenges we face on the border. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by SCOTUS‚Äô decision allowing the transgender ban to go into effect. As a member of the House Armed Services, I look forward to fighting this policy in committee.

https://t.co/4xRzVQcocT Our women and men in uniform put their lives on the line to defend our country and its freedoms. Anyone qualified, able, and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country should be allowed to serve free from discrimination. This week, 2 forest fires broke out in Lincoln County.  Members of the BIA's‚Äã Wildland Fire Management team responded.  Because of the #governmentshutdown these responders, who are battling dangerous conditions, aren't being paid. They deserve better!

https://t.co/qwkR8IyTvu On my way back to DC, and I‚Äôm reminded of the TSA agent I met on my way home last weekend. He stopped to tell me that he was raising his grandson and not receiving a paycheck was putting a squeeze on their household. Our federal employees deserve better! #ShutdownStories Spent time in Luna and Hidalgo counties yesterday talking with electeds, ranchers, small business owners, health care workers, and other community members about the challenges facing rural southern NM, particularly border security, health care access, and infrastructure. https://t.co/hXTa7l589N Celebrating #MLKDay and honoring Dr. King‚Äôs life and legacy with the @NAACP Do√±a Ana Chapter this morning. At this critical time in our nation‚Äôs history, it is as important now than ever that we practice Dr. King‚Äôs teachings on respect, justice, and equality. https://t.co/0Ck1c95L5q In the mean time, I‚Äôve spoken with employees at our federal prisons, border patrol agents and customs officers, air traffic controllers, and TSA agents. They're working hard even though the government is failing them. It's time we do our job. This proposal does not "solve" the crisis at the border.  We also need to discuss manpower and infrastructure at our ports, permanent status for DREAMers,  expanded work visas and a safer, more orderly process for people presenting at our border I am glad to see the President identify issues he is willing to discuss, but the temporary provisions he outlined don‚Äôt solve our long-term problems and broken border policy. New Mexicans are sick of politicians squabbling over speeches and flights.  We need everyone at the table to get our government back on track Started the weekend at home meeting with  @RepEscobar and labor members talking with them about the real effects the #GovernmentShutdown is having on them and the region https://t.co/7Fa3n17LvD These men and women are our country's "first line of defense against opioids or other illegal drugs entering the country."  They deserve better. Customs officers, like the one I spoke to while at home last weekend, shouldn't have to tell trainees to open a credit card and keep a 0 balance because there has been a shutdown each year she has worked for CBP #ShutdownStories Today, marks the end of the 4th week of the #GovernmentShutdown.  New Mexicans can't afford this shutdown any longer. #shutdownstories 

https://t.co/qU5HKpheFa @realDonaldTrump, this is my #counteroffer.  It's time to work across party lines to move on real border security measures and #EndTheShutdown @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @SenSchumer @kevinomccarthy We do need to fix our immigration system.  In fact, I believe a fundamental piece of border security is a clear and moral immigration system. Lets invest in work visas, pass legal protection for DREAMers, and have a faster, fairer process to assess asylum claims #counteroffer @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @SenSchumer @kevinomccarthy @realDonaldTrump, you‚Äôve said specifically that ‚Äúthe system has been broken for many years, the immigration system‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre gonna try and see if we can fix it‚Äù and that ‚Äúall Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump Immigration System: @realDonaldTrump, @SpeakerPelosi, @senatemajldr, @SenSchumer, and @kevinomccarthy all agree, each have said that our immigration system is ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump It is a tremendous problem, &amp; we need to secure our border to prevent violent criminals &amp; traffickers from crossing it.  This is why we should invest $49 million for 275 new Domestic Investigation agents to look into human trafficking, drug trade, and gang activity #counteroffer https://t.co/HiWTZbUI1q @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump, you‚Äôve said ‚Äúmy administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It‚Äôs a tremendous problem.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump Domestic Threats: In 2016, approx. 174 people died/day from drug poisoning. In 2017, nearly 30,000 people died just from synthetic opioid use alone. And human trafficking is the fastest-growing organized crime activity in the US, making almost $32 billion a year for traffickers. @realDonaldTrump Lets do it. Ive seen firsthand why we do need medical support along the border. It‚Äôs unacceptable that 2 children died in US custody. Lets invest the $17 mill for 112 new ICE Health Service Corps staff to improve healthcare services in detention facilities #counteroffer https://t.co/qFdMXsUuJs @realDonaldTrump, you‚Äôve said your ‚Äúplan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.‚Äù Medical support: DHS Sec. Nielsen has said that circumstances along the border have been ‚Äúexacerbated by the increase in persons‚Ä¶suffering from severe respiratory illnesses or exhibit some other illness‚Äù and that it is ‚Äúdifficult for our personnel to be first responders‚Äù @realDonaldTrump So do I, a majority of drugs coming from Mexico into the US come through our ports. Current estimates say we are understaffed by 4000 Customs Officers. Lets invest the $400 million needed to hire those Customs Officers, secure our ports, &amp; help stop the drug flow #counteroffer https://t.co/8l8b4Cypah @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump, you‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI want to stop the massive inflow of drugs.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump Personnel: Customs officers have been called ‚Äúour first line of defense against opioids or other illegal drugs entering the country.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump I agree, we do need to make our ports ‚Äúbigger, more powerful, able to hand more traffic.‚Äù So lets invest the $4 billion CBP Commissioner McAleenan has said we need to get our ports to the quality they need to be #counteroffer https://t.co/SuTD5jUNEH @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump, you‚Äôve said ‚Äúwe want to make the ports bigger, more powerful, able to handle more traffic‚Ä¶have very, very powerful drug equipment there.‚Äù @realDonaldTrump Ports of entry: $2.39 trillion worth of imports traveled through our ports in FY17, sadly, so did a majority of the drugs coming from Mexico. @realDonaldTrump, the border is my home &amp; I believe in border security. While some on the Hill fight over what it means to secure our borders, lets talk solutions; proven, from the ground, New Mexican solutions. Want to talk border security investments? Here is my #counteroffer Today is the first #payday that federal employees will miss because of the #shutdown. This morning I asked for my pay to be withheld until the #shutdown ends. https://t.co/cDinKOcf3u NM is one of the state's hardest hit by the #shutdown.  I voted "yay" on #S24 which ensures that federal employees will receive back pay.  Still work to be done. Thousands of gov. contractors and private citizens that rely on our federal gov. for business are losing wages A government contractor that works w/ air traffic control in Roswell and is affected by the #shutdown called into our DC office, so I jumped on the phone with him to learn more about his situation and talk with him about how and why we need to end this #shutdown https://t.co/ZPh3H4416J Some highlights from #SwearinginDay. It was a privilege to spend the day and share so many amazing memories with my family and constituents!

https://t.co/nLZbw4LcWJ #Strong #smart and #fair investments in border security are in methods that are proven to be effective: technology, personnel, training, and medical equipment. Investments that will help to keep children and families, agents, and our communities safe We heard nothing new from the President last evening. The border is my home, and I am committed to fighting for and implementing policies which will help to make it #strong #smart and #fair @abc7breaking Yes @JoaquinCastrotx @SenJeffMerkley @RepEscobar @RepCicilline @RepBarragan @RepCarbajal @RepJerryNadler @gracenapolitano This will help to make our border strong, smart, and fair, as well as keep families and children, agents, and communities safe. @JoaquinCastrotx @SenJeffMerkley @RepEscobar @RepCicilline @RepBarragan @RepCarbajal @RepJerryNadler @gracenapolitano but more importantly, we learned what issues still need to be addressed to prevent tragedies like these from happening again. At this critical juncture for our border security and immigration systems, it is crucial that we come together to develop solutions to these challenges. @JoaquinCastrotx @SenJeffMerkley @RepEscobar @RepCicilline @RepBarragan @RepCarbajal @RepJerryNadler @gracenapolitano Today provided valuable insight into the circumstances surrounding Felipe Gomez-Alonzo's tragic death. We learned of the improvements that CPB has made over the past month to help improve the medical care of those in their custody‚Ä¶ My thoughts and reaction to today's fact finding trip to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station with @JoaquinCastrotx @SenJeffMerkley @RepEscobar @RepCicilline @RepBarragan @RepCarbajal @RepJerryNadler @gracenapolitano... https://t.co/UFYaWkj50m RT @NBCLatino: Although some improvements were seen on Monday's tour, @RepTorresSmall, D-N.M., cautioned that lawmakers still need to see t‚Ä¶ Tomorrow, I'll be joining @JoaquinCastrotx &amp; other Members while we visit the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station to learn more about the circumstances surrounding Felipe Alonzo-Gomez's death &amp; how we can work together to prevent this from happening again https://t.co/FkC8UEGut5 New Mexicans simply can't afford for this #GovernmentShutdown to continue which is why I voted to reopen the government on day 1 in office #nmpolitics

https://t.co/zqjn16cwlW Family first! It was a privilege to have my family by my side throughout #SwearinginDay and share with them today‚Äôs amazing memories https://t.co/4mAdPlFdhc We had to take our Open House into the hallway because the line was down the hall and out the door! Amazingly humbled, honored, and energized to represent #NM02 #SwearinginDay https://t.co/DEzLTARave It‚Äôs a family affair. I am so honored to be joined by my whole family this morning and some my extended NM family @repbenraylujan #swearinginday https://t.co/mhTp4sXWTi
