From the sugarcane cane fields in Louisiana to the cattle ranches in Texas, the @FarmBureau puts our farmers &amp; ranchers first. I’m pleased to cosponsor a resolution recognizing the farm bureau’s 100th year of steadfast commitment to American farmers &amp; ranchers. https://t.co/YW1r5Talmx While the Supreme Court’s decision is disappointing, I am confident that common sense will prevail and the law will eventually be upheld by the Supreme Court.

https://t.co/DyZZVGXYgv https://t.co/JVl57bwjX9 As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I voted in favor of William Barr’s nomination for U.S. Attorney General.

Tune in! These are true American heros. Taking care of our veterans should always be a policy priority. #SOTU Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for reaffirming what I believe: Life is precious. #SOTU We need to protect all lives- including the unborn. Legislation banning late-term abortions is long overdue.  #SOTU Costly health insurance and prescription drugs are a burden on American families. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for raising this issue at the #SOTU. Rebuilding our infrastructure is something we can all agree on. Congress needs to work together to craft an infrastructure package that’s good for the whole country. #SOTU Leaving miles and miles of our southern border unsecured, unmonitored and unprotected isn’t doing our country any favors.  We have to move forward, compromise and pass border security legislation ASAP. #SOTU I’ll say it again. Legal immigration is good for America, but illegal immigration is not.  We need to improve our immigration system and secure our border. #SOTU Unemployment is ⬇️
Job growth is ⬆️  
157 million people are working in America. #SOTU I agree with @realDonaldTrump. Instead of gridlock and division, let’s choose greatness. #SOTU RT @realDonaldTrump.  Let’s put aside partisanship and govern together.  We need to stop focusing on who’s blue and who’s red but instead get work done for the American people. #SOTU I’m looking forward to hearing @realDonaldTrump address the nation tonight.  This is history in the making.  #SOTU https://t.co/CuSOiwRuuZ I am excited to have Justina accompany me to the State of Union as my guest. She works as a custodian in the Russell Senate building as part of Goodwill’s AbilityOne Program. I appreciate her hard work and her friendly smile. She deserves to enjoy this historic event. https://t.co/DJTHASypTS There are two issues on which I think we can all work—infrastructure &amp; the cost of health insurance. Republicans &amp; Democrats have more in common on these issues than they don’t. I hope the @POTUS will spend time talking on these two issues tonight during the State of the Union. https://t.co/6uKIcf65eo I’m about to go on @CNN @NewDay with @PoppyHarlowCNN and @JohnBerman tune in!

https://t.co/c8e3qxwsGq According to a recent report from the @USDOL, Louisiana has added more than 21,900 jobs since the Senate passed the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act.

Continued economic growth is evidence that our policies are working. https://t.co/EEECrPo9Mp Calvin Moret belonged to a revered group of pilots called the Tuskegee airmen—African American WWII pilots.

Some folks from the Central Louisiana Regional Chamber of Commerce came by my office this morning to share an update from back home.

This morning I met with the @C100LA, the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, the @LAChemAssoc and some bright students from the @mcgeheeschool. https://t.co/BiRUxcLP5R Most of our immigrants in America believe in the rule of law. A lot of them are here because they left countries that didn’t have the rule of law.

Tune in! William Barr is someone who has thought about the world &amp; politics. He understands the law, has integrity &amp; understands he’s representing the American people. My meeting with him today reinforced my belief that William Barr is eminently qualified to be the U.S. attorney general. https://t.co/R4atCXT4eo On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, #WeRemember the millions of Jewish victims and all of those who died during the Holocaust.

Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues are unwilling to budge an inch on this issue. Partisan politics aren’t working. Both sides need to come to the table &amp; hash this out. We need to secure our border &amp; get federal workers their paychecks The Marines, Army, Navy &amp; Air Force are funded. Our Coast Guard is not. We have 41,000 active duty service members in the @USCG. Today we tried passing legislation that would immediately pay our Coast Guards, but thanks to Sen. Schumer, the legislation failed. https://t.co/sCueTWdfCL I’m on the Senate floor fighting to pay the brave men and women of the @USCG.  No federal employees should be working without pay but especially our armed service members.

I’m encouraged by the great work that is happening in Ascension. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/mk4jlKWjSp Nobody wants a shutdown, but most Americans including myself want border security. Speaker Pelosi is as hard-headed as the wall we’re trying to build. I think that she is allowing her hatred for the president to overshadow the need for compromise.

To all those marching today, thank you for being a voice for the unborn children who can’t speak for themselves. https://t.co/oknADZgkuv I’m about to go live on @OutnumberedOT with @HARRISFAULKNER.

Let’s go all the way this year! Who Dat! https://t.co/sXRtsoNxVO In 2018, border patrol agents saw a dramatic spike in illegal drugs crossing our border. Border patrol agents seized 1.7 million pounds of narcotics at our borders. If the Democrats care about ending the #opioid crisis, they should support border security. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/KAjJDPmi3e If you have a Louisiana driver’s license, you don’t need a Texas license to drive in Houston. This legislation applies the same common sense approach to concealed carry permits.
https://t.co/86eTnHHpVL Human trafficking is a heinous crime often committed against society’s most vulnerable people. In the Senate, I’ve cosponsored legislation to try and put an end to modern-day slavery. This is an on-going battle that each of us must work to end. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay https://t.co/y2pBWEAfhB We need to fund the government, but first we need to fund a structure to seal our border. The President has indicated many times that he’s willing to negotiate the amount of money that’s involved, but it’s unrealistic to expect us to seal the border without using a barrier. https://t.co/0xuhRsiN9q The community of Shreveport has lost one of its finest.

I appreciate the work you do and pray you return home safe after every shift. https://t.co/uHKVZRIFE8 Here’s the problem. Speaker Pelosi hates President Trump more than she supports border security. Our southern border is 1,900 miles.

I sent a letter to @SecWilkie asking him to take swift action to make sure our veterans have access to the treatment &amp; intervention resources they need. 
https://t.co/xteLw5nVRN The solution to the problem of mass murders isn’t to trample on the 2nd Amendment by restricting law-abiding citizens’ access to guns. We don’t need stricter gun laws. We need to more strictly enforce the laws that exist.

Stay safe and stay informed on weather updates for your area. https://t.co/yQo4IHPyrI It’s so important for policymakers to get a firsthand look into a K-12 classroom. These students are our future, &amp; our policies directly affect the education of these students. I always enjoy talking to students at schools like Denham Springs High School https://t.co/B0G4CFOfyg Matthew Delcambre, of New Iberia, helped save the Magna Carta, 1 of the most important documents in history. Mr. Delcambre’s done history a great service by going out of his way to save the revered document. New Iberia &amp; the rest of La. should be proud https://t.co/LtDM2YjDw0 https://t.co/F0oQpKmPnR The LSU-Alabama game is a top 5 match-up, and it’s scheduled to be a night game in Death Valley. I’m sure it’ll be a loud and exciting Louisiana Saturday night. Geaux tigers!
https://t.co/1zJxXR8tFq This week President Trump signed the opioid package into law.  This was a huge bipartisan win, not only for Congress, but for the American people.  We can now properly address the opioid epidemic and provide some relief to many families across the country.

Earlier this year, Smokey Robinson came to @senjudiciary to testify on behalf of this legislation. Art makes us more humane.
