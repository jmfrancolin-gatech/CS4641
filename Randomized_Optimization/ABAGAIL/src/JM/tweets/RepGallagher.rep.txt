Great bumping into new @WDNR Secretary Preston Cole today when I was checking out the sturgeon spearing registration station in Winneconne. Good luck to the rest of the sturgeon spearers out there today. Stay warm! https://t.co/Bdbm3x8Q3s Great conversation today with Jeff Bergner at the @HudsonInstitute on how we get a dysfunctional Congress working again. https://t.co/Q3o6EBTzTa Addressing these cyber vulnerabilities will be neither cheap nor easy which is why today’s @TransportGOP hearing on infrastructure investment was so critical. 

As we we modernize our infrastructure system, we must ensure its built to withstand rising cyberthreats. The increasing cybersecurity threat is not just affecting the federal government or large corporations. As I discussed in an op-ed from 2017, American small businesses are the most affected by cybersecurity breaches. https://t.co/q7XRkCbQP6 China’s ongoing theft of American IP to benefit Chinese companies costs the US billions each year. In fact, this theft has been deemed “the greatest transfer of wealth in human history,” and one that has surely damaged our economic competitiveness. https://t.co/J7b9HQcBRT A few years ago, I received a letter in the mail from the US gov't stating that my military records had been compromised. 

We now know that this breach was carried out by the Chinese and compromised the personal information of over 18 million Americans.
https://t.co/Lpmuh4aUoQ RT @amphibwarships: .@RepGallagher reminds us that we must get creative in the story we tell about why maintaining a fleet of 38 amphibs is… Can we trust Huawei with 5G? Absolutely not.

At a minimum, we should demand that Congress avoid insanity. https://t.co/FS0UB9XQAt RT @fox11news: VIDEO: Southern #DoorCounty principal dances to announce #WSChase snow day: https://t.co/zUHVRa0VXr https://t.co/2riIxb3FJn RT @beerinstitute: Couldn’t agree more w/@WiStateJournal editorial.

Compared to the vitriol we see elsewhere, I feel especially lucky to be from NE WI. https://t.co/QZiQCE0G4U cc: @hughhewitt https://t.co/FsZe9NVw5K RT @hughhewitt: This hour my guests are @SecretaryPerry and @RepGallagher as I continue the review of @realDonaldTrump excellent #SOTU2019 RT @TransportGOP: Looking ahead, many ideas to improve our infrastructure will be on the table.  We need to think about how we can address… Lesson #3 is simple: Problems don’t age well. 

That’s true in life and particularly true in politics. We can’t punt the problem of border security to the next generation. So let’s work together over these next two weeks with a sense of urgency to fix it. Until we change the way Congress operates, we’ll be right back where we started: satisfying the literal definition of insanity by doing the same things and expecting different results. 

At a minimum, we should demand that Congress avoid insanity. https://t.co/pKAicWQgDS It's no surprise when this process results in a hurried vote on a bill that we had no opportunity to amend. 

We should instead work from the ground up, starting with the relevant committees &amp; ordinary members. This will increase the likelihood of achieving long-lasting policies. Lesson #2: A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.

It seems we routinely let the President and the most powerful members of Congress negotiate in secret, while the rest of us wait for white smoke to emerge from the White House chimney. In other words, the debate over border security is the best kind of debate to have. It’s not about irreconcilable, abstract principles. It’s about specific requirements that we can measure in terms of geography, human resources and cost. Perhaps Democrats disagree with this proposal. But assuming everyone agrees on the long-term goal of gaining 100 percent operational control of the border, then the only question is: how do we do it more effectively? What is the right mix of barriers, technology and people? Lesson #1: There's massive miscommunication on border security that must be cleared up.

Despite what you may have heard, the White House is not asking for 1 gigantic concrete wall running coast to coast. Rather, the administration wants a comprehensive package that provides for: https://t.co/JmVQMmYJ6y THREAD: To avoid a groundhog day shutdown on February 15, we need to learn three lessons from last month. After all, border security is one of the more solvable challenges we face. 

We can fix this.
https://t.co/QcuzQe7Kqs .@RepSamGraves is right. Congress needs a long-term solution to fund our nation's highways and that means looking beyond the gas tax.
https://t.co/SSBBWnAYLz Thank you to everyone in Luxemburg and Sturgeon Bay who came out to my town halls today. We covered a lot of ground, from tariffs and VA reform to foreign policy and the Second Amendment. I look forward to hosting more across the district. https://t.co/xAPfSrTxWT Wisconsin is set to have 11,000 more information technology jobs by 2024. Great to see local schools like @NWTC helping to educate our future tech workers by expanding computer science learning opportunities. https://t.co/BlwP49Yhoj .@ATWairport's focus on being fast and reliable is just one of many reasons that it's now the 4th fastest growing airport in the country.

#WI08 success stories like this are what I look forward to highlighting on the @TransportGOP Committee this Congress. "It's just a simple fact that you can arrive at @ATWairport and in 15-20 minutes, you can be parked, you can walk into your terminal, be through the security checkpoint and you're at your gate.”
https://t.co/mugyP5641W Stopped by the Einstein Expo today, a great event in Green Bay that helps promote STEM education in the community. We’re lucky to have so many incredible resources right here in Northeast Wisconsin to get kids interested in STEM related fields. https://t.co/pjfFZmK0MQ Last year, I inserted language into the NDAA to address the growing threat posed by the 1000 Talents program. Glad to see the administration taking action. https://t.co/6AQaNs3izM US security increasingly depends upon command of the seas. It is not a birthright and is being challenged by China and Russia every day. This is not a 30-year out problem. This is a here and now problem. The Navy the nation needs is the biggest one it can possibly build—now. As I wrote in @RCDefense last year, maritime superiority is only growing in importance. 355 ships must be a floor, not a ceiling. https://t.co/HhLxMpJkfJ Given that the NDS prioritizes the CCP threat and the first island chain is the heart of the competition, abandoning a 355 ship Navy would undermine the entire premise of the NDS and deterrence by denial. https://t.co/AIgpRoWlZV Russia has been in violation of the INF treaty for over a decade. China has never been a party to the agreement and is amassing an enormous missile arsenal. 

INF is no longer an arms control treaty. It's unilateral disarmament. https://t.co/o1KwPxJ2Eg Regardless of how you feel about tariffs — whether you think they’re good or bad — I think it's obvious that you should want the People's elected representatives, in the most accountable branch of government, to have greater say in our trade policy.
https://t.co/gosJE7NttL Last December I had the chance to see the original 1987 INF Treaty at the @Reagan_Library. INF played an important role in the Cold War, but circumstances have changed.

The short answer: very.

For the long and Ike-related answer, read my new piece with Colin Dueck in @NRO. https://t.co/GaLSX85y1C Beijing wants to dominate 5G in order to access your data.

https://t.co/EAqIX7vSAU Members from @WASBWI stopped by today to discuss issues impacting our public schools, including the need for more special ed teachers and improved internship access for HS students.

Grateful for the important work they’re doing to advance public education in Northeast Wisconsin. https://t.co/5g0Na2RhnM As I said to @MikeGousha this week, to avoid satisfying the literal definition of insanity, Congress must learn the lesson of shutdowns and crisis governance, and change the way it operates.

If we don’t, come Feb. 15, we’ll be right back where we started. https://t.co/c5wgkB3lwG Below the radar, there's a good news story to be told about NATO. Our allies are investing an additional $100 billion in defense by the end of 2020. https://t.co/388nXzgyeL This would be a great time for Congress to pass my bipartisan legislation with @RepRubenGallego to hold Huawei accountable for any sanctions violations. https://t.co/J5yIIkGb97 Proud to intro the "Serve the People, Not the Swamp Act." My new bill:

- Prevents Congress from recessing without first passing a budget.
- Establishes a 5-year lobbying ban for Members of Congress.

We’ve punted on this issue for too long. https://t.co/0lFG0e2VhH Shout out to #WI08’s Cole Kantner for helping save the life of an 18-month-old last week. Excellent work. https://t.co/aKOLHPPjax Jim Mattis is a patriot who has served his country with distinction for more than four decades. His parting counsel about treating our friends like our friends and our enemies like our enemies cannot be emphasized enough. By giving federal prisoners the training and education they need to succeed upon release, this bill goes a long way toward ensuring they are productive members of their communities and don’t return to a life of crime. https://t.co/vOAqXNpSZu Glad to see Matt Kempainen recognized for the incredible amount of time he dedicates to helping out local veterans in need. Northeast Wisconsin is lucky have a Hometown Hero like Matt. https://t.co/lUoalssIu3 Great analysis by @dstroul and @SonerCagaptay. One overlooked aspect of the #SyriaSurrender is the way in which we cave not only to Iran but also to Erdogan, potentially endangering the 2,000 troops on the ground right now. https://t.co/e2qg8oFxno We need a long-term strategy in Syria that advances our interests and protects our allies. Virtual presence will translate into actual absence. I'm afraid we will soon regret a hasty retreat. Long-term, I’m concerned about the growing Russian military presence in Syria. If we are not careful, Russia could grow its new naval and air bases to threaten our access in the eastern Mediterranean, and perhaps even Suez. The administration is right to want to roll back Iranian influence in the region, but we can’t do that if we aren’t engaged on the ground in support of our allies. Handing Syria to the Assad/Putin/Iranian axis is no way to bring stability to Syria, or to the region. President Obama found out the hard way that withdrawing unilaterally from Middle East hotspots tends to leave power vacuums that are filled by actors that do not share our interests. In the case of our exit from Iraq, we only ended up emboldening Iran. "What a country, where someone of an unassuming Midwest upbringing gets a chance to be part of all of this...You can pursue whatever your passion is, wherever it takes you. I mean, that's the American idea, isn't it?" Excellent address.

Thank you for everything, @SpeakerRyan. https://t.co/vphtCvO42d More than anything, what this week’s wall-funding-fueled, potential shutdown demonstrates is that if Congress fails to change the way it does business, trust in the institution will only continue to erode.
https://t.co/X6ihyCaomD Attention #WI08! My D.C. office has moved. Next time you're in town, be sure to stop by 1230 Longworth House Office Building. https://t.co/vrKKn8yxrv The only explanation I've heard for the recess is that we're waiting on a compromise. But that gets it backwards—that assumes it has to be @POTUS, @SenSchumer, and @NancyPelosi in a back room cutting a deal and that we as members of the House don't have a separate job to do. https://t.co/7KSbbwtBYv The problem is we aren't having this debate. It's been five days since Congress was last in session, and with a shutdown looming Friday, discussions are happening behind closed doors. Lock us in on the House &amp; Senate floors and let's have the discussion. https://t.co/4giRLjh83a This month I was proud to help secure the largest @USDOT grant in Brown County history. The nearly $20 million grant will be a significant driver of economic development in Hobart &amp; Howard, and will expand transportation access for families across #WI08. https://t.co/4v6YJq8fB5 RT @IssueOneReform: Congressional Reformers Caucus Co-chairs @RepKathleenRice (D-NY), @RepGallagher (R-WI) &amp; @RepDerekKilmer (D-WA) recentl… Glad to see the large turn out at the Wreaths Across America ceremony in King this weekend. Especially during the holidays when we're home celebrating with our families, it's important to remember that our veterans' sacrifices helped make that possible. https://t.co/gDwpKxsMy9 Part of what makes cybersecurity so challenging is that it's not just our military or government coming under fire. Increasingly, state-directed hackers are targeting defense contractors well down the supply chain. We have to better work as a team. https://t.co/6Q0pgoJaKm Our message is clear: Iran must pay a steep price for its aggressive and destabilizing behavior, and the United States will never tolerate its pursuit of nuclear weapons. New legislation I introduced with @SenTedCruz and our House &amp; Senate colleagues does exactly that by effectively cutting Iran off from the international financial community. https://t.co/l9tklMCAR9 Withdrawing from the JCPOA was only the first step in ratcheting up pressure on the Iranian regime. We now have an important window to impose maximum economic pressure and degrade the Iranian regime’s ability to export violence across the region.

Our new bill is critical to cleaning up our campaign finance system and reducing the corrosive influence of dark money in our elections. https://t.co/bKK57PMdci https://t.co/fLqRbNSLYX If there's no plan, why are we out of session? We should be working over the weekend to come up with a plan to prevent a shutdown. https://t.co/UUpSokwDPv Covered a lot of ground this morning on @wprmornings, from my farm bill vote to trade with China to congressional reform to what's ahead in the 116th Congress. Listen below. https://t.co/rJRqNNoaN4 If we are 8 days away from a potential government shutdown, why are members leaving town for over 5 of them? This makes no sense. https://t.co/UxQAejLFCW While the Navy has made important progress in the aftermath of last year's collisions, stable and adequate funding is essential to rebuilding readiness. When I asked the CNO in January to rank its importance on a scale of 1-10, he gave it an 11. https://t.co/z7XNAorPLg The American people deserve to know who is spending hundreds of millions of dollars every election cycle to influence their vote. This bill is critical to injecting more transparency into campaign finance and helping reduce the corrosive influence of dark money in our elections. https://t.co/tlNDCwNdtQ RT @wprmornings: Republican U.S. @RepGallagher joins us tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. CT to talk about the issues facing the 116th Congress. 

What… Of all the malign activities of groups like Hizballah and Hamas, few are more reprehensible than their use of civilians as human shields. My bipartisan bill sends a clear signal that the U.S. will not tolerate this behavior. https://t.co/fbWD3QG5ZG Honored to take part in the @RedCross’s annual Holiday Mail for Heroes event today. Saying thank you during the holidays is the very least we can do for our brave servicemembers at home and abroad. https://t.co/qkgvjVeUyP RT @RepRubenGallego: Huawei &amp; ZTE are an economic and national security threat.

The nearly $20 million in grant money will be a significant driver of economic development and jobs for not only Hobart and Howard, but for all of Brown County.
 https://t.co/NnjMYu0Szy My bipartisan bill with @RepRubenGallego sets a simple standard: if a Chinese telecomm firm is found to have violated U.S. sanctions moving forward, it will be subject to the same severe punishment originally imposed on ZTE.
https://t.co/XMBIiSlLCV Chinese telecomm firms like Huawei represent a growing threat to U.S. national security. As state-directed enterprises, they ultimately report to the Chinese Communist Party and will be employed where and whenever possible to undermine American interests and those of our allies. The nearly $20 million in @USDOT grant money will be a significant driver of economic development and jobs for not only Hobart &amp; Howard, but for all of @browncountywi. I was proud to help secure this funding and I’m excited to see the project move forward.
https://t.co/4v6YJq8fB5 Right now women only account for 7% of all truck-drivers in the U.S. This presents a huge opportunity for women in Northeast Wisconsin looking to get into the transportation industry, especially at a time when the country is in dire need of more drivers. https://t.co/tyUxlwTgj7 RT @RepRubenGallego: Huawei and ZTE are controlled by the Chinese government and systematically work to break U.S. laws and steal our secre… RT @OutnumberedFNC: Today on Outnumbered, for the first time, we welcome @RepGallagher from the great state of Wisconsin to the show today.… Classy move by Mike McCarthy. "There is an unmistakable pride that runs through the bloodline of all Green Bay Packers, and that is why it's not the bricks ... but the Packers people and the pride they have for this organization that I will miss the most." https://t.co/NbMScnwmmW General Milley clearly understands the critical importance of a strong defense topline to our military’s state of readiness.  His dedication to building a modern and ready military makes him an exceptional pick for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. As General Milley once analogized about unstable and unpredictable funding, “One cigarette's not going to kill you. But you do that for 8, 10, 20, 30 years, you're eventually going to die of lung cancer. It's the cumulative effect, over time, that is really devastating." GO NAVY, BEAT ARMY! https://t.co/5Sw2cBJhGt These allegations cannot be seen in isolation. Rather, they are only the latest examples of Huawei being a threat to our national security and that of our allies. Congress cannot afford to be complacent. https://t.co/8i8h5N65ss The rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the biggest issues facing Wisconsinites. This is why I introduced bipartisan price transparency legislation—a critical step in lowering healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes in #WI08. https://t.co/mkHHyN0aTe Couldn't agree more with @JimTalent. We cannot end the military rebuild before it even gets started. We have to keep up the momentum and deliver a defense budget worthy of our service members. https://t.co/75sJ3XlLcC On this day 77 years ago, over 2,000 brave servicemen and women lost their lives during attacks on Pearl Harbor and other locations across the Pacific. It’s my hope that days like today serve as a call for all of us to conduct ourselves in a way that’s worthy of their sacrifices.
