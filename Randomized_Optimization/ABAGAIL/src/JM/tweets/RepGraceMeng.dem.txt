Thank you @RepEspaillat for inviting me to speak at the first annual #DominicansOnTheHill event. #NY &amp; #Queens have a thriving Dominican presence that enriches our neighborhoods. Honored to celebrate their rich culture &amp; contributions to #NYC &amp; our nation. https://t.co/BVP1FAXzDy Thanks to Speaker @CarlHeastie for meeting w/ me &amp; NY delegation members in D.C. Discussed federal priorities for #NY including my fight against the census citizenship question, my efforts to enact voting reform, MTA funding, NYCHA &amp; restoring state &amp; local tax deductions (SALT). https://t.co/HTVY5ZyHDn Jin’s attendance at the #SOTU showed how @realDonaldTrump's decision to end #DACA has shattered the lives of #DREAMers &amp; highlighted the urgent need for a permanent solution. Jin fears he will not be allowed to re-enter the U.S. if he leaves to study at the Univ. of Oxford. 2/2 Met yesterday with my #SOTU guest Jin Park, the first #DACA recipient to be awarded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. Great to be joined by Members of Congress who were also Rhodes Scholars: Antonio Delgado, Andy Kim and Jim Himes. Thanks to my colleagues for joining us! 1/2 https://t.co/zbajpluzzk Proud to be among the first Members of Congress to join @AOC’s #GreenNewDeal. Honored to stand with her and @SenMarkey to unveil the measure. Climate change is the biggest threat to our existence. We must act now to save our planet before it is too late. https://t.co/aTdD7vvTk4 Every mom has the right to nurse or express breastmilk for their babies in the cleanest &amp; safest spaces.  2/2 Thrilled that @EleanorNorton’s Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act passed the House today. This bill would require certain public buildings that have public restrooms to provide a clean &amp; private lactation room, other than a bathroom, for breastfeeding mothers. 1/2 Congress has a responsibility &amp; duty to combat gun violence in the US. In any given year, over 120K Americans are shot. Over 17K children &amp; teens are injured or killed from gun violence each year. This is unacceptable &amp; must stop. We need #ActionOnGunViolence! #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/DV9Rpr8p0e But I will not stand for attacks on hardworking middle class families, immigrant communities, and young people, and I will continue to fight against any proposals or policies that seek to harm them.  My full statement here: https://t.co/u3ZxAlS85O. #SOTU 2/2 .@RealDonaldTrump addressed the nation this evening and offered his vision of where we are headed. I look forward to supporting efforts to fix our crumbling infrastructure and help lower the cost of prescription drugs. #SOTU 1/2 During #BlackHistoryMonth, I’m proud to commemorate the many contributions and accomplishments of the African American community. Watch my video message from the @LatimerHouse Museum in Flushing which was the home of African American inventor and electrical pioneer Lewis Latimer. https://t.co/cPBlpvDTuI Happy #LunarNewYear! Today, I reintroduced a resolution that seeks the House of Representatives’recognition of the holiday, as the Asian American community prepares to celebrate on Tuesday. https://t.co/4HSLyQP5wM Honored to speak at the Queens Jewish Community Council’s (QJCC) Legislative Breakfast in Queens. Discussed my initiatives on behalf of the Jewish community, fighting anti-Semitism and other issues. https://t.co/z5r3F8xVaA Proud to stand with religious and community leaders to denounce #hate crimes during event this afternoon at the Bukharian Jewish Community Center in #ForestHills. There is no place for hate! https://t.co/GHZF1O4ITn Great time at the @chianfed's 39th Homeric Award Gala in Queens. Congratulations to my colleague @SenatorShaheen for being tonight's honoree. Thank you to the Chian Federation for all it does to assist the #Greek American community and for promoting Greek culture in the U.S. https://t.co/5QRhFXUSzb Read more about my #SOTU guest Jin Park who I invited to help stand against the President’s #immigration policies. https://t.co/1zYTiZuCyw @NBCNewYork .@NYDailyNews reports on my constituent Jin Park, the first #DREAMer Rhodes Scholar, being my guest at the #SOTU next week. https://t.co/G6IqrNYKiG RT @NydiaVelazquez: I'm pleased @NYCMayor &amp; @HUDgov have reached an agreement preventing a takeover of @NYCHA by @realDonaldTrump's Admin.… The first #DREAMer Rhodes Scholar – who resides in #Queens – will be my guest at the #SOTU next week. I invited #DACA recipient Jin Park in an effort to stand against @realDonaldTrump's cruel immigration policies. Details: https://t.co/jIQsmCxemS. In addition to the Homeland Security Subcommittee, I’m proud to continue serving on two other key Appropriations subcommittees: the Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies. 2/2 I’ve secured a seat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security! As a member of the panel, I will fight for critical homeland security funds for #NYC &amp; I’ll push for rigorous oversight of @realDonaldTrump’s immigration enforcement policies. https://t.co/HyJTNTvrZ4 1/2 Thrilled to meet @USSCUNY &amp; talk about the importance of student aid &amp; protecting DREAMers. Young people are the future of our nation. Look forward to supporting efforts that help our young people grow &amp; succeed. #justice4students #usscuny #UnitedStatesofStudents https://t.co/Ema4iRz8fX The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, with $3 billion permanently lost. It devastated federal workers &amp; negatively impacted the American people. It’s unconscionable that @RealDonaldTrump is already threatening a 2nd shutdown if he doesn’t get his border wall. Honored to take part in recent Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony held by #BoyScout Troop 49 in #Bayside. https://t.co/P6zzXekvcP "Never again” should not be a slogan we say lightly once a year, but must define our policy toward combating anti-Semitism and protecting vulnerable populations all over the world from genocide. My full statement below on  #HolocaustRemembranceDay. https://t.co/a4wPURWWJj @alisabaremboym @realDonaldTrump Stay tuned! For 35 days, @RealDonaldTrump, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, &amp; House Republicans have refused to work with Democrats to reopen the government. I am hopeful that both sides will secure a long-term spending bill that funds the government without border wall funding. https://t.co/8YZ4y7e3fh Completely unacceptable! Mr. President, I call on you once again to reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/WpwSaAKLss I once again urge the President to end this reckless shutdown. Continuing to hold federal workers hostage and harm our economy and the American people is unacceptable. Mr. President, reopen the gov’t!  #TrumpShutdown 2/2 .@HouseDemocrats have voted 11 times to reopen the gov't. Democrats support border security funding &amp; continue to negotiate in good faith. @RealDonaldTrump’s demand for a $5.7 billion wall in exchange for ending the gov’t shutdown continues to do great harm to our nation. 1/2 Great spending time with @RepJeffries and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House Minority Leader who visited Capitol Hill this afternoon. She has been working hard to expand voting rights, build coalitions and bring together communities of color. https://t.co/s496iH7Ibi Great time visiting with local students yesterday at the P4 school in #FreshMeadows. https://t.co/bvlBj7cYcz Disappointed with #SCOTUS’ decision to allow @RealDonaldTrump’s #TransMilitaryBan to take effect. Transgender Americans have bravely served our nation &amp; help keep our country safe. I will continue to oppose the administration’s discriminatory policies. https://t.co/U0zuLzoBZ4 The life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspires us to this day! As we honor his memory, let’s recommit ourselves to embracing the legacy he left behind, and continuing his fight for equality for all. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” #MLKDay The President is using #DREAMers &amp; #TPS recipients as political pawns while trying to put taxpayers on the hook for a $5.7 billion wall he promised Mexico would pay for. Unacceptable! It’s now day 29 of the #TrumpShutdown. Enough is enough. @realDonaldTrump must reopen the gov’t. The reckless #TrumpShutdown continues to harm government workers, our economy and the American people. With the President’s shutdown dragging on, I’ve put together the following guide that answers many questions on how you may be impacted: https://t.co/UNds4FHcl1. Thanks to @BrianLehrer for having me on his show on @WNYC. Talked about my legislation to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall during the shutdown. Also discussed my voting rights legislation &amp; other issues. https://t.co/aiPHuOrFZ4 My full statement commending Judge Furman’s decision to reject the administration’s census citizenship question: https://t.co/MR7ef6HBIr. #2020Census A federal court blocks @RealDonaldTrump’s administration from adding a citizenship question on the #2020Census! As a member of Congress who has led the charge against the question, I applaud this ruling. It’s the right decision and will help ensure a more accurate census count. Moving tribute at memorial service for Don Capalbi, my longtime staff member and a #Queens civic leader who passed away in December. Thanks to all the people – including the many community leaders – who came out to remember his years of service and dedication to our district. https://t.co/HeBFWTYOFa Nice time at the #Korean American Day celebration in NYC held by the Korean American Association of Greater New York (KAAGNY). Proud to recognize the achievements of the Korean American community. Korean Americans have helped, and continue to help, our country grow and prosper! https://t.co/3eHhSSMQ1C Proud to cosponsor and vote YES on the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act. This critical bill requires the President to fill the Special Envoy position and cements U.S. leadership fighting anti-Semitism. I will continue to work against anti-Semitism everywhere. UPDATE: I have officially introduced the "No Walls Act" to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall during the shutdown. Thanks to cosponsors @RepLoisFrankel  @NydiaVelazquez @RepGonzalez @RepJayapal @RepAnnieKuster. #TrumpShutdown #NoWall https://t.co/BENK0gH8Pl I'll be introducing a bill to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall. The President can’t just refuse to fund the gov't, say “EMERGENCY!” &amp; get whatever political wish he desires. Not how the Constitution works. https://t.co/oLEBE69Y1Z My next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will be on January 23rd. If you're a local #veteran or beneficiary that would like to meet with a representative from the VA, I encourage you to contact my office to make an appointment. Please call 718-358-MENG (6364) by January 16th. https://t.co/JYJ6yMIliV Thanks @NYGovCuomo for meeting w/ NY delegation members in DC. We stand together against a border wall and in our call for @RealDonaldTrump to end the gov’t shutdown. Also discussed other issues critical to NY including SNAP &amp; the need to restore state &amp; local tax deductions. https://t.co/VVqoDkv0Bc The death of Firefighter Steven Pollard is an awful tragedy. He put his life on the line to keep our city safe and I am deeply saddened by his loss. My thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, colleagues and all of New York’s Bravest. https://t.co/CDpWlO15qA @FDNY Glad to see progress in efforts to combat mailbox fishing in NE #Queens. After I called on @USPS to replace all borough collection boxes w/ new anti-theft boxes, the agency agreed to do so. Thanks to USPS, @NYPD111Pct &amp; @USPISpressroom for all their work. https://t.co/cV5oGF3BVs Tonight, @RealDonaldTrump told the American people why we need a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Because of Pres. Trump, over 800,000 federal employees are working without pay or furloughed without pay. This is wrong &amp; the government shutdown must end! https://t.co/0BsELXVtRQ House Democrats are introducing legislation today to expand background checks on gun sales as we mark the 8th anniversary of the Tucson, Arizona shooting that killed 6 &amp; wounded 13, including former Rep. @GabbyGiffords. Time for Congress to finally take action &amp; #EndGunViolence! I applaud @NYCMayor for his plan to guarantee health care to all #NYC residents. Health care is a human right! Everybody deserves access to reliable and quality medical care and this initiative will ensure that all New Yorkers receive the coverage they deserve. The #TrumpShutdown enters its 3rd week, forcing thousands of civil servants to continue working without pay or be furloughed without pay. Over 14k federal employees &amp; their families in #NY are suffering from this irresponsible shutdown. @RealDonaldTrump must reopen the gov’t! https://t.co/JG6cwZ4L4x American families, businesses &amp; communities continue to be hurt from the effects of the #TrumpShutdown. The new Democratic-led House voted to reopen the gov't but @RealDonaldTrump continues to play politics with people’s lives. The President’s reckless shutdown must end now! https://t.co/1Lyl1u1627 The women of New York City’s Congressional delegation! Excited to be working with these awesome colleagues. @RepMaloney @AOC @NydiaVelazquez @RepYvetteClarke #NYC https://t.co/QVKiEYuq7i In addition, I look forward to introducing and supporting legislation that helps working families succeed, protecting our voting rights, ensuring Americans have access to clean air and water, and supporting policies that mitigate climate change. 3/3 I’ll continue to work across the aisle but I will stand firm against efforts that undermine labor rights for Americans, protections for immigrant communities &amp; minorities, &amp; environmental standards that keep the public and children safe from harmful chemicals and pollutants. 2/3 Honored to be sworn into my fourth term in Congress today as Democrats take control of House. I will continue fighting for #Queens and our nation, and I once again call for an end to the government shutdown. #116thCongress 1/3 https://t.co/WSwTVkOmBv Starting off the new year with visits to several senior centers in my district. Stops included senior centers in #RegoPark, #Pomonok and #Bayside. Always great to talk with local seniors! #Queens https://t.co/105jQaP9Lh Happy New Year! Wishing you and your loved ones a wonderful 2019 filled with much prosperity and happiness. Awful tragedy at John Bowne High School in #Flushing. As the mother of two kids who also play basketball in Queens, my heart aches for the family and friends of Lenny Pierre. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers. https://t.co/4RtL0WFQ1O The seven days of #Kwanzaa begins today. I send my warmest wishes for a happy and joyous holiday to all who celebrate! Sad about the death of William Thompson Sr. He was a pioneer who worked tirelessly for New York while serving as a State Senator, City Councilman and Judge. Condolences to his loved ones at this difficult time. https://t.co/Ge7IFA4p2J Merry #Christmas! Wishing a happy holiday to all who celebrate here in Queens and throughout the nation. The government shutdown is an embarrassment and shame on @RealDonaldTrump and House Republicans for allowing it to happen. We must fund the federal government for the American people. https://t.co/eANjQQKeOk I’ve sent a letter to the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons calling for clear guidance on the agency’s distribution of feminine hygiene products to incarcerated women. https://t.co/QKzStq4FqW #MenstruationMatters https://t.co/Gtsw2r5erX Today is the 6th anniversary of the tragic shooting at #SandyHook Elementary School that resulted in the loss of 26 innocent lives to gun violence. Parents should not have to worry about the safety of their children at school. Let’s recommit ourselves to ending gun violence. As a parent of young kids, I'm heartbroken over the death of this 7-year-old. This shouldn’t have happened &amp; Customs &amp; Border Protection must conduct a thorough investigation. @RealDonaldTrump’s cruel immigration policies continue to devastate families. https://t.co/83kCgCJd5s Reminder that tomorrow (Saturday, December 15th) is the deadline for New Yorkers to enroll in a health insurance plan for coverage beginning on January 1st. To sign up, go to https://t.co/XKz3WIfBLD. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered for the coming year! Today is the 3rd anniversary of the #ParisAgreement. @RealDonaldTrump’s decision to abandon this deal and roll back critical environmental protections are detrimental to a cleaner future for our nation. We must fight climate change! #ActOnClimate Jan 2017 Trump signed exec order for new border security personnel. Private contractor awarded $297 million for 7500 hires over 5 years. In 10 months spent $13.6 million and hired TWO people. Massive FAIL. Read my letter to Sec. Nielsen and DHS IG alert. https://t.co/Pl98LTsVf0 https://t.co/w4BC6hRSJY Great to join seniors this week for the #Hanukkah celebration at the @SelfhelpNY Austin Street Senior Center in #ForestHills. #Queens https://t.co/OpqZmHYiRl Asked @DHSgov to withdraw proposed public charge rule that would deny green cards to immigrants who lawfully use public benefits. No adequate rationale from #DHS, as required by law, to justify the harm this proposal does to families. https://t.co/CFZvE6kTry Sad to announce the death of Don Capalbi, my longtime community liaison who was also the head of the Queensboro Hill Flushing Civic Assn. He was a great human being who worked tirelessly for the people of our Congressional district &amp; will be sorely missed! https://t.co/LNk5pee4Ww https://t.co/dpARHXqELR Thanks to those who organized the lightings: Councilman Vallone &amp; the Bayside Business Improvement District (BID), Bayside Hills Civic Association, Electchester Street Fair Committee, &amp; the Bowne Park Civic Association &amp; Broadway Flushing Homeowners Association. 2/2 Nice time attending menorah &amp; Christmas tree lightings in my district today. Events included lightings in #Bayside, #BaysideHills, #Electchester &amp; Bowne Park in #Flushing. #Queens 1/2 https://t.co/EhhNrCnwz2 Happy #Hanukkah! Wishing a joyous holiday to all who begin celebrating the Festival of Lights tonight. George H.W. Bush was a patriot who served our nation in so many ways &amp; always did so with honor &amp; integrity. He was also a devoted family man. Sad about his passing. The legacy of his service will never be forgotten. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the entire Bush family. Today, @RepDavidEPrice, @JoaquinCastrotx and I sent a letter to @RealDonaldTrump informing him that his “Remain in Mexico” policy for #asylum seekers is not only wrong, it’s contrary to U.S. and international law. https://t.co/u1zYpvRoie The first meeting of Democrats in the New York delegation for the upcoming 116th session of Congress. Welcome to our new members! Looking forward to getting down to work with my current and soon-to-be colleagues in January. https://t.co/nqDhqnr0l4 I thank the late Pat Toro for coming up w/ the idea for this project. Pat, who resided in #ForestHills &amp; served as President of the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 32, had a great vision for this initiative &amp; he worked tirelessly over many years to make today a reality. 2/2 Today, a groundbreaking took place for the #Queens Vietnam Veterans Memorial in #Elmhurst. Proud to have helped push this project forward &amp; I look forward to its completion. A photo of the design is below. Must always remember the sacrifices our #veterans made to our nation. 1/2 https://t.co/iLER4xGMhW This is disgusting. There is no place in our society for anti-Semitism or hate of any kind. I hope that the police arrest those responsible for this despicable act. https://t.co/o4t4mXQe6c @Columbia .@RealDonaldTrump’s threat to shut down the government is irresponsible. Funding the government shouldn’t be a partisan issue. https://t.co/ErMi4YItiv Joining officials from @queenshistoric as they announce the annual holiday tour of #Queens historic sites. Locations consist of the @ArmstrongHouse, Bowne House, @FlushingTwnHall, Friends Quaker Meeting House, Kingsland Homestead, @LatimerHouse &amp; Voelker Orth Museum. https://t.co/YetdhGRBh5 Proud to work w/ @RosLehtinen in sending letter to @USAIDMarkGreen urging him to prioritize gender equality &amp; women &amp; girls’ empowerment in @USAID's work around the world. Support of these goals will strengthen our partner countries &amp; US national security. https://t.co/dTixvBNvts https://t.co/98Py3abgqx Firing tear gas at children and families at the U.S.-Mexico border is appalling. This is not acceptable. We are better than this. https://t.co/SFNE9aFnFW Pleased to speak at the Queens inauguration ceremony for Hami Nepali Global, a new New York-based organization that advocates for the interests of the #Nepalese community. https://t.co/HC2srWklVl Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.

On #SmallBusinessSaturday today, don’t forget to #ShopSmall in #Queens to show your support for the great small businesses that serve our borough. Hoping everyone is having a wonderful holiday. Happy #Thanksgiving! https://t.co/xWrlhjvBe0 Shocked and saddened about the sudden passing of State Senator Jose Peralta. The first Dominican American elected to the State Senate, he was a fighter for Queens and worked tirelessly for his constituents. My prayers are with his loved ones at this difficult time.

Proud to congratulate to the entire M.S. 216 community for this outstanding achievement! #Queens https://t.co/AIdOkEM2yJ Great to take part in #Diwali celebrations over the past few days. One held in New York by the Rajasthan Association of North America and the other held on Capitol Hill by @BAPS, @IndiasporaForum and @HinduAmerican. https://t.co/7sTwiVXUO3 Pleased that Judge Jon S. Tigar temporarily blocked @RealDonaldTrump’s cruel policy to deny #asylum to migrants who don’t cross through checkpoints at the U.S. border. Just because you don’t like the law doesn’t mean you get to change it on a whim. https://t.co/eFdCgGx99m Wonderful time addressing the #ForestHills Civic Association during the group’s meeting tonight. Provided an update from Washington and spoke about my initiatives in Congress. #Queens https://t.co/bSWSQfmIkn Always an honor to congratulate new Eagle Scouts from #Queens.

I’ve sent a letter to @DeptVetAffairs Secretary Robert Wilkie asking him how this problem can be fixed. https://t.co/zAjV7NpSWj 1/2 https://t.co/ZqXJvVuIkM Today is #VeteransDay, the day we honor those who served our nation. But it should be more than just today that we pay tribute to these brave men &amp; women. We should show our appreciation throughout the year! To all our #veterans, thank you for defending &amp; protecting our freedom. In #Bayside this afternoon where I’m honored to participate in Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony held by #BoyScout Troop 268. #Queens https://t.co/3uDOoHut50 Attention local #veterans &amp; beneficiaries: My next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will be on Thurs., Nov. 29th.

The number is 718-358-MENG. https://t.co/7FHywEz4tV @RealDonaldTrump wants to ban people from claiming asylum: https://t.co/e4y72ybG9x.  The law seems pretty clear to me... https://t.co/IB1qRKLpzQ Another mass shooting &amp; more senseless tragedies, this time in #ThousandOaks, CA. This rampant gun violence across our nation has taken too many lives. It is unacceptable &amp; has got to stop. Congress must take action to #EndGunViolence. Praying for all who have been impacted. Wishing a happy #Diwali to everybody celebrating here in New York and throughout the world! As we mark this year’s holiday, I wish harmony, prosperity, and hope to all who observe the festival of lights. Americans are heading to the polls today. Proud to have cast my ballot here in #Queens.

I am also continuing my call for an investigation into Secretary Ross who lied to me about communications he had with the White House regarding his decision to add the citizenship question. The Secretary must be held accountable! 3/3 I’ll be watching this trial closely and will continue to stand against including this question on the upcoming census. 2/3 The trial on @SecretaryRoss’ decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census is getting underway today in NYC. Glad that SCOTUS on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s effort to postpone it. 1/3 Proud to honor our #veterans and the sacrifices they made to our nation during the annual Veterans Day ceremony in #MiddleVillage. https://t.co/1eMZLZPXki #DaylightSavingTime ends at 2 a.m. tomorrow (on Sunday).

Please be sure to stay safe when trick-or-treating or celebrating. Check out these valuable safety tips for parents and kids: https://t.co/QjWtARz9bD. https://t.co/ynZSkWVesC Appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s threat to end #birthrightcitizenship. #POTUS can’t just throw out the 14th Amendment because he doesn’t like it. This is just another tactic that is part of his larger anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/Y9nHuSjh0j We must all speak out against these heinous acts and do everything possible to combat hate in whatever form in takes. Please keep the victims, their families and the entire Tree of Life congregation in your thoughts and prayers. 2/2 There is no place in our society for hate and anti-Semitism. This assault on the Jewish community is an attack on us all and must be denounced by every single American. 1/2 Once again, gun violence has caused another tragedy. No place is safe. Disgusted by this cowardly &amp; evil attack at a synagogue. I send prayers to all who are impacted &amp; stand with the people of #Pittsburgh &amp; all in the Jewish community. This senseless gun violence must end! The wall will also include, among other things, historic information about the site. This project will ensure that this spot finally receives the recognition and respect it deserves, and that a proper memorial is created to honor those who are buried here. #Queens 2/2 Joining @NYCMayor, @QueensBPKatz, @CMPeterKoo to unveil new designs for memorial at the Olde Towne of #Flushing Burial Ground.

The award recognizes my support for small businesses and their access to capital. https://t.co/0bSwJftYLs Deeply opposed to the Trump Admin’s proposal to roll back the rights of the transgender community. I stand in solidarity with over 1.4 million transgender Americans who only want to live as their authentic selves. #TransRightsAreHumanRights #WontBeErased https://t.co/DqqM3fCPaa These attempted attacks are despicable and must be condemned by all. Glad there have been no injuries and I thank our brave law enforcement officers for their swift response. Will continue to monitor developments. https://t.co/BG8xQK25eR Saluting the work of the @QueensLibrary and the services and resources it provides to our borough during the Library's 2018 gala last night in #Queens. https://t.co/h479ZL5poP Proud to have passed several important measures into law that will assist our #veterans. We must ensure that our veterans have the care and resources they need and deserve, and caring for our veterans’ wellbeing will always be a top priority of mine. https://t.co/KVr26eNiqu Critical for a probe of Secretary Ross to move forward. We must have a full accounting of what happened regarding his decision to add a citizenship question. #2020Census. 3/3 Secretary Ross must be held accountable for not telling the truth to Congress. Last week, I urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Ross and now I’m calling on Sessions to recuse himself due to comments that reflect his bias on the issue. #2020Census. 2/3 https://t.co/iCmElvUslG Terrible decision by #SCOTUS that for now will shield @SecretaryRoss from answering questions about adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. During a hearing, the Secretary lied to me about the origins of including the question on the Census. https://t.co/abpYJTCsTv 1/3 Nice time touring the Ironworkers apprentice training facility in #Queens. The facility is run by Locals 40 and 361.

The overhaul will improve passenger safety, enhance the appearance of the station &amp; make it handicap accessible. #Queens https://t.co/pNU7gmXctj Great time meeting with local seniors and discussing issues that concern them during visit to the Peter Cardella Senior Center in #Ridgewood. #Queens https://t.co/dRKf9skccE Good meeting with new @LIRR President Phillip Eng. Discussed improving service for riders, the renovations and upgrades to LIRR stations in #Queens and other issues. Also thanked him for saving the Lefferts Boulevard Bridge in #KewGardens. https://t.co/NxFO1y2Kxv Spoke with @CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census.  @SecretaryRoss lied straight to my face about where this request came from. This was never about protecting voting rights. https://t.co/OrZqy7umvg Proud to announce that my next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will be on Oct. 24. If you're a local #veteran or beneficiary that would like to meet with a representative from the VA, I encourage you to contact my office to make an appointment. Please call 718-358-MENG by Oct. 22. https://t.co/L7DM1zMRRP Also pleased to have obtained additional items in the #FAA bill that seek to improve the aviation industry. 2/2 Pleased to have secured several measures in the #FAA Reauthorization Act that the President recently signed into law, including provisions which aim to mitigate excessive airplane #noise over #Queens. https://t.co/s42OWt6fti 1/2 Honored to attend and speak at Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony this weekend held by #BoyScout Troop 268 in #Flushing. Also taking part: State Senator Tony Avella and Assemblyman Ed Braunstein. https://t.co/1Qsa6mSBDI Called on AG Sessions to investigate @SecretaryRoss for lying to me during a hearing about a conversation he had with the White House on adding the citizenship question to the #2020Census. @TheJusticeDept https://t.co/SR9jLp8yZi Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East and Democrats are committed to its safety and security. U.S. support for America’s friend and partner should never be made into a partisan issue. Spoke with #NPR’s @hansilowang about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. Unconscionable that @SecretaryRoss lied to my face during a Congressional hearing on the issue. https://t.co/01kU0xA4At Hate being lied to! Very displeased to learn that @SecretaryRoss lied to me on the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census at a hearing this spring. Not a tough question, but I guess when you’re in company with Steven Bannon, you’ve got to cover it up? https://t.co/D8IHUL6pbf Proud to join @RepJudyChu’s bill that would defund @DHSgov’s proposed public charge rule. This proposed rule seeks to deny green cards to immigrants who lawfully use public benefits.  This is wrong. #ProtectFamilies Two more days left for New Yorkers to register to vote! The deadline is October 12th for the elections on November 6th.

He was a tireless public servant who was a fixture in Queens. He championed important issues &amp; worked to address many neighborhood concerns. Proud to have worked w/ him while I was in Albany. Condolences to his family. Proud to stand with postal workers from across #Queens to protest @RealDonaldTrump’s proposal to privatize the U.S. Postal Service. The U.S. mail is #NotForSale! #USPS https://t.co/w4OML1YW1A Upset to see #Kavanaugh confirmed to #SCOTUS today. Nothing in his confirmation process has given me confidence that he’ll be an independent, impartial, or even-keeled judge, particularly following his conduct last week. Incredibly sad day for our nation. #BelieveSurvivors Sent a letter to the head of the @EPA expressing concern over the possible closure or minimized role of the Office of Children’s Health Protection, which has argued for tougher regulations on industrial pollutants. Trump Admin. must not abandon efforts to keep our kids safe. https://t.co/6hxpKSJcls Joining the @FlushingBID to announce #Flushing Business Day. The initiative, funded by @NYC_SBS, seeks to promote area businesses by attracting more consumers to Flushing. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Critical that we do all we can to help them succeed. https://t.co/AUx8AgFjtL Today is #InternationalDayOfNonViolence which is celebrated on the birthday of Mahatma #Gandhi. I am sponsoring a resolution to commemorate the observance and pay tribute to Gandhi’s message of non-violence and peace. Critical that we remember the legacy that Gandhi left behind. https://t.co/GIDjTEUALY Deeply disturbed by @RealDonaldTrump’s decision to deny visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats and U.N. employees. I oppose this dangerous decision by #POTUS and urge him to reverse it immediately. @HRC #EqualEverywhere https://t.co/9fUSAi3Rw6 Wonderful to join #Bayside’s Armenian Church of the Holy Martyrs and members of the community for ceremony co-naming 210th Street and Horace Harding Expressway – the corner where the church is located – as Armenia Way. https://t.co/Prass020Xb Great time at the #Glendale Kiwanis luncheon. Proud to join the group in celebrating its 65th anniversary. Pictured with me are Glendale @Kiwanis President Kerrie Hansen and @BobHoldenNYC, @SenJoeAddabbo &amp; @assemblymanmike. https://t.co/U56zkII4pX Terrible tragedy in #Indonesia. Heartbroken over the loss of life and destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami. I send my thoughts and prayers to all who have been affected and I thank all the first responders who are working to rescue survivors. Reminder: Tomorrow (Sunday, Sept. 30) at #ForestHills High School, my office &amp; Senator Gillibrand’s office will host Service Academy Day. I encourage high school students interested in applying to any of the U.S. Service Academies to attend. The event begins at 10:30 a.m. #Queens https://t.co/S59uHtz2cM Proud to march with my colleagues to the Senate to protest the Senate Judiciary Committee’s planned vote on Judge Kavanaugh. We must allow the FBI to investigate the serious allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/4TnYH4vCSP Today, Dr. Ford will testify on sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh in the Senate. Hope the process will be conducted in a manner that is respectful to Dr. Ford &amp; set an example of how to support victims &amp; survivors of sexual assault &amp; misconduct. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/iRER2pW5av My measure to create a ZIP code for #Glendale has been passed by the House. Residents of Glendale have long advocated for their own ZIP code and now we are a step closer towards making that a reality. https://t.co/uiE7sv69D0 #Queens Thank you @RepAnnieKuster for your bravery in sharing your powerful story. You’ve reminded us why we must ensure that any Supreme Court nominee has the highest moral character. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/gUMO8ksWVO As we learn of new sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, I’m proud to stand in support of Dr. Ford &amp; her courage to come forward before she testifies tomorrow at the Senate Judiciary Committee. All survivors of sexual assault deserve to be heard. #IBelieveSurvivors https://t.co/3w8jVfURko Proud to be honored by the National Asian Pacific Islander Prosecutors Association (NAPIPA) and the Prosecutors Committee of the Asian American Bar Association of New York. I thank both groups for their great work and for having me to speak at their dinner in NYC. https://t.co/tkipQdKF6B I am presently sponsoring the 21st Century Voting Act which seeks to modernize #voting in the U.S. &amp; make election day a national holiday. I’ve also introduced legislation to lower the voting age to 16. 2/2 Today is #NationalVoterRegistrationDay. If you haven't registered to vote, please do so. Participating in our electoral process is one of the hallmarks of our democracy &amp; the best way to make your voice heard. For info on registering in NYC, go to: https://t.co/JKXI9t9P0X. 1/2 Deeply opposed to Trump's proposal to deny green cards to immigrants who legally use public benefits. It will harm immigrant families by prioritizing the wealthy &amp; scare immigrant families away from critical programs that help children &amp; parents thrive. #ProtectFamilies More sexual misconduct allegations against Judge #Kavanaugh further illustrate the need for an FBI investigation. The Senate Judiciary Committee must halt the confirmation process to give law enforcement the time it needs to conduct a thorough &amp; rigorous investigation. Honored to congratulate new Eagle Scouts during Court of Honor ceremonies in #Bayside. One held by #BoyScout Troop 49 and the other held by Troop 268. #Queens. https://t.co/Q3JKuoolME I’ve sent a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urging her to eliminate LaGuardia Airport’s noisy TNNIS Climb, the controversial flight pattern over #Queens that according to a new study negatively impacts the health of borough residents. https://t.co/qjQ7PMslXg #PuertoRico still has a long way to go and I remain committed to doing everything I can to ensure that our fellow Americans on the island receive the aid they need to get back on their feet. 3/3 Recently, I secured a provision in a key appropriations bill to hold the Trump administration accountable. My measure would require the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General to issue a report on the mistakes and failures of FEMA’s response in #PuertoRico. 2/3 With @NydiaVelazquez, @NYCMayor, colleagues &amp; advocates marking the 1-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria striking #PuertoRico. Discussed my efforts to help Puerto Rico &amp; criticized the President’s response to the storm as well as his comments disputing the new death toll. 1/3 https://t.co/O0fTiIQ18H RT @RepSwalwell: “We had help that day” — Tammie Jo

@FAA is considering single pilot cockpits for cargo planes. This would be disastrous.… Proud to join @NydiaVelazquez &amp; @SenWarren in sending a letter to Pres. Trump denouncing his grossly inaccurate statements about the fatalities in #PuertoRico after Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria. Pres. Trump must apologize &amp; publicly acknowledge the official death toll. This evening marks the beginning of #YomKippur. I wish the Jewish community in Queens and across the nation an easy and meaningful fast. Deeply disappointed by the Trump administration’s proposal to cap the number of refugees resettled in the U.S. at 30K people in 2019. This is a drastic one-third reduction from the 45K-person limit that was set for 2018. Turning our backs on refugees is wrong. #RefugeesWelcome My office &amp; Senator Gillibrand’s office will be hosting Service Academy Day for high school students interested in attending one of the U.S. Service Academies. The forum will be on Sunday, September 30th at #ForestHills High School. I encourage all interested students to attend. https://t.co/M0sxo8dWaJ Fun time at the third annual Back to School Carnival held in #Bayside over the weekend by the Northwest Bayside Civic Association and Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York (KCS). https://t.co/AyKZYAS0uq The claims against Judge #Kavanaugh are serious and troubling, and these allegations must be fully and thoroughly investigated. The vote on his confirmation must be postponed until such an investigation concludes. In Glendale, remembering and honoring 9/11 victims from #Glendale, #MiddleVillage, #Ridgewood and #Woodhaven during memorial service this afternoon at the 9/11 Memorial Garden in Forest Park. #NeverForget https://t.co/kJMQxwQY5M September 15 marks the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Month! Proud to celebrate the amazing contributions of Hispanic Americans and to continue fighting for the Hispanic community in Congress. #HispanicHeritageMonth Honored to attend @CHCI’s 2018 gala. It was a beautiful evening to celebrate amazing Latino leaders across the US, including Mayor Fuentes of Loíza, Puerto Rico &amp; Mayor Berlingeri of Orocovis, Puerto Rico, who were welcomed on stage during a tribute to the people of Puerto Rico. https://t.co/25uDRVMf3i My next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will take place on Wednesday, September 26th in my Northeast #Queens office. I encourage local #veterans &amp; beneficiaries who would like to meet with a VA representative to make an appointment. Please call 718-358-MENG by Monday, Sept. 24th. https://t.co/FH4wBWLvrw September is Suicide Prevention Month. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. Each life lost is one life too many. We must continue to devote resources for suicide prevention &amp; reduce the stigma surrounding suicide. #StopSuicide Honored to provide closing remarks at @SAALTweets briefing to mark the 17th anniversary of #September11th. Proud of the work SAALT does in fighting against violence, hate and discrimination directed at the South Asian community. https://t.co/w9nY8IhudE Thrilled to learn that @PPFA has chosen @DrLeanaWen as the next president of Planned Parenthood! Dr. Wen is a fierce public health advocate, immigrant, and a doctor. Can’t wait to see how Dr. Wen will lead Planned Parenthood. #IStandWithPP Pleased to discuss ways to improve opportunities for Minority- and Women-owned Businesses in #NewYork. Thank you @RepEspaillat for hosting this meeting with @RepGregoryMeeks @rubendiazjr &amp; former Congressman Charlie Rangel. https://t.co/HZ1geyYEyF Tomorrow is New York state’s primary election day! Make sure your voice is heard by voting tomorrow. Want to find your polling place? Head to https://t.co/Qdg1QALZUp. Remembering those who lost their lives on 9/11 during ceremonies this evening at Juniper Valley Park in #MiddleVillage and in #ForestHills at the headquarters of the Forest Hills Volunteer Ambulance Corps. #NeverForget https://t.co/BJBimIcod9 Honored to join Bayside Senior Center this morning to join their ceremony remembering #September11th.  We shall #NeverForget the tragic events that unfolded 17 years ago today. https://t.co/Yw1LKfjGCR We must #NeverForget the horrific attacks of 9/11. 17 years after that tragic day, we continue to grieve for the victims &amp; their families &amp; remember the sacrifices of our brave 1st responders &amp; those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses. All will remain in our hearts forever. L’Shana Tova! This evening marks the beginning of #RoshHashanah. I wish the Jewish community a happy, healthy and sweet New Year. After President Trump’s administration ripped kids away from their parents at the border, hundreds of families still remain separated. Now @POTUS is seeking to detain immigrant children indefinitely. Another heartless &amp; senseless move by this President. https://t.co/b36OnKDTRJ Deeply concerned that we don’t have a full picture of Judge #Kavanaugh’s record. The American people deserve to know the full extent of his work including during the George W. Bush Administration. The lack of transparency about Kavanaugh’s documents is unsettling. #StopKavanaugh Working men and women are the backbone of our nation.  They helped build our country and continue to make the U.S. grow and prosper. Today, please join me in saluting the contributions and achievements of America’s workforce. Happy #LaborDay! In revoking salary increases for federal workers, President Trump is once again sticking it to the middle class. Federal employees live in our communities, contribute to our local economy &amp; provide us with essential services. The President should reverse his decision. The nearly $68,000 grant will educate more people, especially students and families, about the contributions that Lewis Latimer made to society. Important that we preserve the rich history of our borough. https://t.co/NQ7gv48wLX #Queens 2/2 Pleased to have helped the Lewis @LatimerHouse Museum in #Flushing secure a federal grant. The facility was the home of African American inventor &amp; electrical pioneer Lewis Latimer who played a critical role in the development of the telephone &amp; incandescent light bulb. 1/2 John McCain was a war hero, American patriot and a tireless public servant. Saddened over his passing. He dedicated his life to our country and did so with honor and distinction. I send my deepest condolences to his family, friends and constituents as our nation mourns his loss.
