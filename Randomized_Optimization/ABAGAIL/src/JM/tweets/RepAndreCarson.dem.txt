It pushed fighting imagined threats over creating opportunity for all. I hope we can rise above &amp; work on policies that move our country forward, like infrastructure, medical research &amp; national security. Despite our differences, there are things we agree on.  It's time for us to find common ground on what really matters to American families (2/2). https://t.co/Z5Ia0j4SG9 Heading into the #SOTU and hoping to hear @realDonaldTrump put forth a real plan to avoid another #TrumpShutdown, address our nation's crumbling infrastructure and tackle common sense gun reform.

Catch up here: https://t.co/tZKrb8cNWz Thank you to all the #Indy community service providers, local government entities and nonprofits who connected federal employees to vital resources today! I am grateful the government will reopen, but today's deal is only for three weeks and we know it will take longer for people to recover the damages caused by the #TrumpShutdown.

Hurting federal workers hurts our national security and our economy. Its time to #EndTheShutdown TODAY. https://t.co/66HM5IsNQ2 Day 32 of the #trumpshutdown. @realdonaldtrump and the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House for two years. Yet didn‚Äôt try to fund the wall. Did they know it was unpopular and would lose support?  This is clearly a political stunt. End the shutdown TODAY. Today, we honor the legacy of a man who reminded all of us of our shared humanity by pushing love over hate &amp; peace over division. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs message continues to resonate today, inspiring us to set aside prejudices and pursue opportunity and justice for all. This #TrumpShutdown is not a game. It‚Äôs having devastating real life impacts for hundreds of thousands of workers, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck. https://t.co/IDX5BdmyBI Welcome to newest Democratic Members of the House Intelligence Committee: @RepSeanMaloney,@PeterWelch,@RepValDemings, and @CongressmanRaja.

I'm looking forward to working with each of you! We are now on day 25 of the partial government shutdown.

These are about safe aircraft, safe food &amp; housing vouchers for low-income families. They have nothing to do w/ a wall &amp; shouldn't be held hostage. The Senate should pass them so we can end the #TrumpShutdown. Let's get our government workers back to work. Today. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/osa6tCNxIZ (2/2) We need to fund our government so we can provide critical health and safety services. Only then can we tackle comprehensive immigration reform. #TrumpShutdown (1/2) Tonight @realDonaldTrump stoked fear while Speaker Pelosi &amp; Senator Schumer laid out the facts. @realDonaldTrump manufactured a crisis at the border, and now 800,000 Americans are also facing a crisis due to Trump‚Äôs shutdown.

Instead of funding a wall we should adopt comprehensive immigration reform to protect our border &amp; fix our broken system Fact: a #Shutdown would force 420,000 federal employees to work without pay &amp; another 400,000 employees to be furloughed-right before the holidays.

My full statement on the #HelsinkiSummit here-&gt; https://t.co/aZ2dpe04pY (4/4) This not how a President acts. He is abandoning American interests to protect Russia. It's time for Congressional Republicans to stand on the side of
evidence. (3/4) The evidence is indisputable‚Äîthe Russians interfered. And, now they admit they wanted Trump to win. @realdonaldtrump was elected to defend our democracy. Instead he believes Putin‚Äôs denial over abundant evidence presented by non-partisan American intelligence analysts. (2/4) As Putin reminded us, he is a former KGB officer.
He won‚Äôt admit to an attack on our democracy just because the President asks.
We must follow the evidence. We can't let the President or politics disrupt
ongoing investigations. (1/4) Today‚Äôs summit between President Trump &amp; Putin
was shocking. @realDonaldTrump refused to condemn Russian interference, instead blaming American victims. This isn‚Äôt just rhetoric. Its abandoning our
interests. (2/2) It‚Äôs more clear than ever that @RealDonaldTrump should be holding President Putin accountable, not trying to strengthen relations w/ Russia at the expense of our allies. (1/2) Today‚Äôs indictment proves what Democrats have been saying for months: that the Russian government directly interfered in the 2016 election &amp; continues to undermine our democracy today. REMINDER: A Congressional field hearing will be held tomorrow, 7/13 in Columbus, OH to discuss the solvency of Central States Pension &amp; other multi-employer pension plans. This will be an opportunity to share your recommendations &amp; concerns.

The bill would amend the work-study section of the Higher Education act, which provides federal funds to support college students‚Äô work and service experiences. https://t.co/uKdrrudhGC Putting Brett Kavanaugh on our nation‚Äôs highest court threatens women‚Äôs rights, worker‚Äôs rights and more. Call your senators and let them know #WhatsAtStake #SCOTUSPick ICYMI: A Congressional field hearing will be held this Friday, 7/13 in Columbus, OH to discuss the solvency of Central States Pension &amp; other multi-employer pension plans. This will be an opportunity to share your recommendations &amp; concerns. Learn more -&gt; https://t.co/yWOdsnnZyh Have a safe and happy Fourth of July holiday, friends! Thank you to those currently serving and to all those who have served so that we may enjoy our freedom! #July4th https://t.co/L83WSsVrzR My heart is with the @capgaznews staff and community of #Annapolis after today‚Äôs horrifying and senseless act of gun violence. It‚Äôs long past time for Congress to come together and act to help #EndGunViolence ICYMI: Busy day in @Transport yesterday! My Federal Protective Service Reforms were included and passed in H.R. 6194, &amp; we also approved $45M for repairs &amp; safety upgrades to the Bean Federal Center in Indy.  -&gt; https://t.co/XHW0s6e5M9 I stand w/labor because labor stands w/working people all across the nation and world! #Janus #UnionStrong https://t.co/Rjaf2nC1pL Today‚Äôs decision will be remembered as a shameful sanctioning of discrimination, and one that history will judge harshly. -&gt; https://t.co/8imUG8YuCB https://t.co/2jkPRxURgn Discrimination is not a national security strategy, and prejudice is not patriotism. Trump‚Äôs xenophobic travel ban is an outright attack on the Muslim community that violates our nation‚Äôs commitment to liberty and justice for all.  #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/yCGdlpdItt This decision is about presidential authority, NOT an affirmation of the President‚Äôs bigoted policy or history of targeting immigrants. His policy continues to hurt countless families across our country. Congress must vote to strike down this affront to our values as Americans. https://t.co/9u8mVnxXGm Thanks to everyone who came out to today‚Äôs Northwest Neighborhood Planning Meeting! https://t.co/LwufZA8tTv Indiana welcomed 96 new U.S. citizens from 35 countries during this morning's naturalization ceremony. #WelcomeHoosiers https://t.co/hzcrTAQ6A3 Disappointing update today in #rail subcommittee hearing on pipeline safety from #Trump Administration. Congressional changes we passed years ago to save lives are still overdue. Today, on #WorldRefugeeDay I call on @realDonaldTrump &amp; the #TrumpAdministration to end their cruel policy of separating families. No one chooses to become a refugee. We must continue to promote the safety &amp; well-being of vulnerable refugees as they seek a better life. https://t.co/Zfudbpkt9f Promoting human rights has been an American priority for decades. By withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council we lose an opportunity to drive change through dialogue. It‚Äôs tragic to allow violations and bias to go unaddressed through our absence. Children should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. Babies need to stay with their loving parents. I support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct which would stop the #Trump Administration's government sanctioned child abuse policy. https://t.co/qHqLMjaxwZ Are you as outraged by the heartless separation of children from their parents as I am? This is a choice being made by the #TrumpAdministration, not the law. Your voice matters. Join me in speaking up to #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/HwNzk5lhDr Applications to intern in one of my offices this fall are due July 6. Check out my website for more details! https://t.co/64fJyJ0rke https://t.co/FkGoCrlkGl With @SCOTUS decision on #MuslimBan due any day let‚Äôs
not forget the faces of Trump‚Äôs #MuslimBan: https://t.co/OT2y7SkbjR As Trump and Jeff Sessions try to prevent victims of domestic violence and those fleeing gangs from receiving asylum, today I am wearing a purple ribbon to say Seeking Refuge is a Human Right! We are a better nation than this! https://t.co/zuldJ2IMEj The summit between @POTUS &amp; #KimJongUn has the potential to be an important first step toward a productive dialogue. Next steps must involve reaching specific, actionable steps on denuclearization, human rights, ballistic missiles &amp; other critical threats. https://t.co/bBewFxO37q Every day, Hoosier scientists work hard to make strides to provide innovative treatments to patients. Today, I welcomed a few of them to my DC office. #EliLilly @LillyPad https://t.co/CBzPRRFfZp This #ImmigrantHeritageMonth we honor the immigrants and refugees from around the world have fled oppression, poverty, and persecution, and traveled to America in search of a better life for themselves and their families. #IStandWithImmigrants https://t.co/8hMyr3NjXr Reminder: Office Hours is happening tomorrow, Thursday, 6/7, from 10am-12pm. 
Stop by the Indianapolis Public Library Wayne Branch and see how my office can help you! #officehours #Indy https://t.co/aSlMye2ixN #RFK was assinated 50 yrs ago today. About 2 months earlier he made what may be his most famous speech in #Indy. Recently, Congress passed the Kennedy-King Establishment Act, my bill which designates Indy‚Äôs Martin Luther King Memorial Park as a National Commemorative Site. #RFK50 https://t.co/nMp9cKUHbD Today's ruling underscores the importance of nationwide nondiscrimination protections.  When an LGBT person walks into a store, they shouldn‚Äôt have to wonder whether they‚Äôll be denied service because of who they love or who they are. #MasterpieceCakeshop Today Hoosiers and people across the country will come together for National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Join us in the #WearOrange campaign to remember the lives lost to gun violence &amp; celebrate those standing up for a new way forward ‚Äî enacting sensible gun safety laws. https://t.co/eauVjj4aMl Big congratulations to this year's Congressional Art Competition winner, Rachel Knierman, from @roncallihigh in #Indy. Rachel's work will be displayed in the United States Capitol for one year. https://t.co/QMk4XDsHT5 Today we honor the valiant men &amp; women in uniform who laid down their lives for their country and for their brothers and sisters in arms. We salute their sacrifice and treasure their memory. #MemorialDay https://t.co/I8nwXNsbFm Last year I was proud to partner w/ the American Legion to introduce a resolution recognizing National Poppy Day. Join me in wearing a red poppy to honor those who have served &amp; pay tribute to all who lost their lives defending our great country. #FlashbackFriday #PoppyDay https://t.co/QxqIeGQYpi There are no words left to say, only actions left to do. #NoblesvilleWest  #NoblesvilleSchoolShooting https://t.co/YINjNP6tvu (2/2)  I was proud to support our bipartisan bill to fund our military yesterday. But we can do more to protect Americans by tackling gun violence. When wars abroad get our support &amp; protecting people at home get ignored, we are failing at national security. https://t.co/Y6sn17AROo (1/2) This #MemorialDay we will remember the 2,411 service members killed since 2001 and all who have died for our country. We cannot  forget that they died to protect us. But every day 96 of the Americans they fought for are killed with guns. 13,000 gun homicides per year. https://t.co/Y6sn17AROo Closely monitoring the situation at Noblesville West Middle School. Praying for Noblesville and our whole community. https://t.co/jPGQpZUAGu #TBT to when 2014 Indy 500 Champion, @RyanHunterReay and the Borg-Warner Trophy visited my office. #Indy500 #ThisIsMay https://t.co/CUIyeg8ieP With lives on the line, this is not the time for bullying and insults to win the day. President Trump &amp; Kim Jong Un are walking away from a historic opportunity to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and possibly avoid war. Cooler heads must prevail and return to the table. Today I was privileged to host Nancy, a former foster youth from #Indy for Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day! Nancy was among the many #FosterYouth who came to Capitol Hill to shadow Members of Congress &amp; discuss how to improve America's child welfare system. https://t.co/pYdIyec115 Proud to work w/ my @TransportDems colleagues to reauthorize a critical water infrastructure bill today #WRDAworks Clifton Morlan served in @USArmy, US Army Reserve &amp; US Army Reserve National Guard between 1992 and 2003. With the help of my office, today, he received his long awaited Korean Service Medal and United Nations Service Medal ‚Äì which were both missing from his record. https://t.co/PzJygwBkpj When the same thing happens over and over, just this time in Texas, and nothing has been done to stop it‚Äîthere is nothing new to say... ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/s5balXH2d2
