If we get to that point, my name will be on the petition to discharge, too. Thankful for the opportunity to serve as Energy Subcommittee ranking member &amp; excited for the next two years! https://t.co/FYXnYcShi3 GOD Bless America. Terrific end to a terrific speech, @realDonaldTrump! #USA #SOTU https://t.co/vXMflWXHT7 The 75th anniversary of D-Day is coming up in June. Those brave, young soldiers knew their cause, they knew who they were there to help. Their story is one of courage and bravery. POTUS is right…They knew America had to prevail. Good always triumphs over evil. Humbled to be here with Holocaust Survivors…we must never forget. Blessings to y’all… Dems can’t even clap for the idea of being born free and founded on liberty and independence? That we will never be a socialist country? Hmm… America first is a good thing. We should never apologize for protecting and advancing our interests at home and abroad.  #SOTU Thank YOU, @realDonaldTrump for addressing the atrocities that occurred in the New York and Virginia legislators in recent weeks. ALL life is precious, and I, too, will never stop working to protect the unborn. American freedom has allowed for scientific advances in HIV/AIDS, childhood cancer, &amp; more. We will not stop until these diseases are eliminated. I can’t help but think of the kindness shown by Former First Lady Barbara Bush and our local hero &amp; childhood cancer survivor, Mia. A GREAT shared moment on the House floor. 100 years of women's right to vote, more women in the workforce, and more women serving in Congress than ever before! #USA #SOTU It's simple... #WallsWork Humanitarian assistance… more law enforcement…drug detection at ports of entry…closing of loopholes…plans for new physical barriers… all of these are common sense measures we’ve all agreed on in the past. What’s so different now? #SOTU We must do something about this. Until then, people will continue suffering. Who are we to tolerate and allow this? Sec. Nielsen announced today 2,000 migrants arrived in yet another caravan…their plan is to enter the border into Texas. This is unacceptable. POTUS hits the nail on the head with his assessment of our immigration crisis. Glad to see we can ALL stand for criminal justice reform…I wish I could see the same for our veterans and for our energy dominance… #SOTU “After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.”
Well said, Mr. President…I am proud to stand with my colleagues and applaud this!
#SOTU Just last week, the most recent jobs report came out – it was filled with great news of our strong economy… jobs, jobs, jobs. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the rolling back burdensome regulations, we are continuing our economic boom! #SOTU Our greatest generation is represented tonight. Three WWII vets…just like my dad. Thank YOU for your service. GOD bless our brave military men and women. Excited to hear from our President!

#BackTheBlue #ThinBlueLine Each and every day, our brave law enforcement agents proudly wear the uniform and protect our communities. On National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I especially offer my heartfelt thank YOU. Why do D's want to "fund" the govt only until Feb 08? To get past President's State of Union where he will expose their weakness on Natl Security at our border &amp; their unwillingness to care about Law Abiding Americans more than they do about illegals &amp; terrorists. Sad, huh?...rw Do you remember... Under President Obama, all 54 Ds in the Democrat-controlled Senate voted to double the length of a new border fence with Mexico, double the number of border agents to 40,000, and spend $40 billion on border security.
What changed…? Glad to see the group Foreigners donating to Shriners Hospital in Galveston.  Pardon the pun: Y’all Rock! #ForeignersRock The economy added 2.6 MILLION jobs in 2018! In December, we added 312,000 jobs – well-above the predicted increase. #TaxCutsAndJobsAct continues working for everyone!

Healthcare should be patient-centered, physician-supported, and market-based. Period. President cites lowest unemployment rate: Blacks &amp; Hispanics, says we have doubled standard deduction for couples so that first $24,000 of their wages are tax free. R ‘s leap to feet to applause &amp; the D’s sit there like “bumps on a log” I hope Americans remember come election. Sitting on House Floor. SCOTUS just entered. Waiting on the President. Watching Jeff Flake is on the dais speaking to Vice President Pence &amp; Speaker Ryan. How’d yah like to be a fly on that wall? Undoubtedly talking about how Arizona has prospered under Trump. You think? #MAGA 2.4 million new jobs...Small business confidence at an all-time high...Unemployment at an all-time low...Stock market records...This is GREAT news for Americans!

#TaxCutsAndJobsAct is providing TREMENDOUS relief for the middle class and small businesses. -@POTUS #SOTU .@POTUS is exactly right, Thank YOU, Cajun Navy, Ashlee Leppert and all of our brave first responders, volunteers, and neighbors. #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: Watch the #SOTU live alongside tweets from key Trump Administration accounts here: https://t.co/Njo52YOlc2 Citing #TaxCutsAndJobsAct ExxonMobil expands projects. Great news for American energy dominance, our Great State, and TX14! https://t.co/IFBy2c6S8H The government intrusion this memo describes must see the light of day. The info in the memo is of profound concern...Americans need to know the truth. Chairman Nunes and the House Intel Committee made the right choice. 

https://t.co/VyIlrrE6c2 On this day in 1945 Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated. January 27 is International #HolocaustRememberanceDay - A day when nations join together to promote awareness of the Holocaust and remember its lessons so as to prevent future genocides. Never again... Senate D’s finally figured out that Americans see right through their childish temper tantrum! Hope Americans remember going forward who put Americans on the “back burner” in the process. Now let’s get back to work on behalf of hard-working Citizens. Hopefully Senate D’s learned! Schumer lectured Trump. Really? Senate D’s shut down govt over a fake deadline. They chose to adversely affect lives of law-abiding citizens, put our troops in harms way &amp; jeopardize health insurance for 9 million kids. Simple - you can’t hold Americans hostage. Sent this letter earlier today. #SchumerShutdown withholds pay from our brave military men and women. This is uncalled for.

Standing with our troops...GOD bless them! https://t.co/ZsdE9reiVj In the Senate, 60 votes are needed to pass a bill of this nature. There are 51 Rs. The individual aspects of the bill have bipartisan support, but Senate Ds voted against 6 yr CHIP reauth, the military, &amp; funding the government.
Senate Ds shut down the government...why? We need to separate politics from policy, and focus on the priorities and deadlines at hand. We have a job to do. Last night Senate Ds had a choice – fund CHIP, provide tax relief, support the military, &amp; keep the government open. They chose shutdown. They voted against children, against the military, &amp; against our country. This is outrageous. This is unacceptable. ICYMI: Republicans supporting the ProLife Event today. Speaker Ryan did an incredible job! Did you see any D’s on the stage? Would that the Democrat Party cared as much about the unborn as they seem to care about children who were brought into the country illegally. Disgraceful! https://t.co/rr96MIgy70 What a difference Trump is making. Remember October 2013? Obama &amp; Reid said they would not negotiate with Republicans over the CR! President Trump is engaged &amp; working to keep the government open! Senate D’s better sit up &amp; take notice! Americans sure are! RT @RepHensarling: RT if you agree – we must protect innocent life and defend the rights of those who are unable to defend themselves. #Mar… The House passed the CR last night. 230 of us voted for...
✅ CHIP funding
✅ Tax Relief
✅ Military
✅ Funding our Government

Now we’re waitin on the Senate. I believe @SenSchumer once said a shutdown is “the politics of idiocy, of confrontation, of paralysis” #SchumerShutdown? We took an oath to provide for the common defense... Let's stop playing politics and support our military.
https://t.co/Lro1bHZANB Be extra cautious on the roads today... this cannot be stressed enough. https://t.co/xivZ6kZ170
