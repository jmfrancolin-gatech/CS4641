Thanks to Chairman @LindseyGrahamSC for working with me &amp; @SenFeinstein to arrange a hearing next month to hold Trump officials accountable following the horrifying death of 2 migrant children in U.S. custody at the southern border. It’s clear the American people want to see the Mueller report. The time is now for Congress to pass the Blumenthal-Grassley Special Counsel Transparency Act. Americans have a right to know the facts. https://t.co/7uAHsUrQAL I asked Barr whether he would at least allow Mueller to testify to Congress about his findings. He refused to commit. The American people deserve transparency. I’ll be voting no. I am deeply concerned that Barr will do the President’s bidding &amp; put Trump’s interests ahead of the public’s interest. Trump’s threats to derail or even obstruct the Russia investigation—as recently as the #SOTU—shows the need for full disclosure of findings &amp; evidence by the Special Counsel, which Barr has refused to commit to. I urge my colleagues to oppose him. No commitment from AG nominee William Barr to disclose the Special Counsel report means he is likely to be Trump’s lawyer at DOJ, not the people’s lawyer. #EnoughIsEnough Today the tireless work of countless Americans has led to the 1st hearing on gun violence prevention since Sandy Hook &amp; other senseless shootings.

Actions speak louder than words. Trump’s actions betray his words tonight &amp; American values. His call for an end to the Russia investigation is another effort to derail &amp; even obstruct or avoid any accountability for potential wrongdoing. That line shows all the more reason why the Special Counsel must release a report w/all the facts &amp; evidence directly to Americans. This #SOTU speech was a tale of two countries. President Trump’s calls for unity seem deeply hollow &amp; empty when he appealed to policies that critically divide us. He wants to build more walls—not bridges.

That’s why Senator @ChuckGrassley &amp; I have introduced legislation requiring complete &amp; full disclosure of the findings, in service of transparency &amp; the public’s right to know the facts. For me, the issue of releasing the Special Counsel’s report is a defining &amp; definitive test of a larger question: will Mr. Barr be the people’s lawyer or the President’s lawyer? The answer is unclear &amp; that’s deeply concerning. I disagree with William Barr on policy issues from women’s health care &amp; reproductive rights to criminal justice reform &amp; civil rights. And importantly: I disagree with his decision not to commit to releasing the Mueller report or comply with a subpoena to release the findings. Today I met with William Barr to ask him again to commit to release the complete Special Counsel’s report directly to Congress &amp; the American public. He chose not to. This issue is transcendent at this point in our history. Therefore, I cannot support Barr’s nomination for AG. https://t.co/y8DcaDy3pK Proud &amp; honored to have Gerry Wright of Andover, CT join me for #SOTU.

Reproductive health isn’t a political game for American women like it appears to be for Congressional Republicans. This vote should fail, &amp; Republicans in Congress should get back to doing the job their constituents actually sent them here to do &amp; open the government. Rather than working to address today’s news that an unspeakable &amp;  apparently unknown number of children were ripped from their families at the border, the purported pro-life party is focused on permanently standing between low income women &amp; their right to access an abortion. Rather than bringing up any of the numerous House-passed bills languishing before the Senate that could end this unnecessary shutdown, we are voting on a bill to ban abortion coverage. This vote to block millions of American women from their constitutional right to access an abortion is yet another excuse for Republicans to put themselves exactly where they don’t belong—between a woman &amp; her right to control her own reproductive decisions. Our bill makes a simple clarification to existing law—ensuring all federal employees are able to access unemployment benefits when they’re caught in the middle of a gov't shutdown. A missed paycheck is a missed paycheck, whether you are working without pay or furloughed. Federal workers on the job &amp; unpaid deserve the same financial lifeline as furloughed workers. When I met air traffic controllers &amp; TSA officers they told me they aren’t able to access unemployment benefits because they’re going to work. This fundamental unfairness must be fixed. As a reminder, @foodshare will be in @Bradley_Airport's employee parking lot until 2:00pm today providing food to TSA employees in need of assistance. #tbt Last week I visited @foodshare to hear their #ShutdownStories. The president's personal pet project to build a wall is endangering CT families' access to vital food assistance. Through this period of uncertainty, thank you @foodshare for working to support the people of CT. https://t.co/T0NSATDeIq Every Trump official responsible for this cruel policy &amp; its cover-up must come before Congress &amp; be held accountable. .@JoaquinCastrotx &amp; I will be introducing legislation to provide the victims of this barbaric process w/legal status &amp; a path to citizenship to ensure that they receive treatment for the trauma they have experienced &amp; the opportunity to rebuild their families in safety. We should be furious that only now we're learning about the unspeakable scope &amp; scale of the brutal tragedy imposed on innocent asylum seekers. Trump Admin must come clean &amp; tell us exactly how many kids it ripped away from their families— &amp; how many still haven’t been reunited. https://t.co/BRwBso32nP Rudy is losing it. After Trump repeatedly states “no collusion!”—Giuliani seemingly flips on his client. Possibly adding to credible proof of crimes by unindicted co-conspirator Individual #1, the President of the United States. https://t.co/V7KWQSbqSY RT @foodshare: Foodshare will be at Bradley International Airport TODAY, January 17 from 12 noon – 2 pm in the employee parking lot with a… IG report is a signal to Trump that he cannot flaunt the Constitution in order to preserve the best business deal. 200 of my colleagues &amp; I will keep holding his feet to the fire with our foreign emoluments lawsuit. https://t.co/ENdgseYCRX MSU Board of Trustees’ decision to leave Mr. Engler in this position for as long as it has is an affront to the brave survivors he has mistreated. Now, MSU must commit to finding a replacement who will help heal wounds that have only been carved deeper under current leadership. Engler’s appalling conduct in a meeting with Kaylee Lorincz, during which he pressured her to accept a payoff without her attorney present, is only one example of an extensive record marred by indifference &amp; a stunning lack of empathy. I believe Kaylee. Mr. Engler’s dismissal is way past due. Throughout his tenure, Engler has failed to demonstrate the leadership necessary to fight against abuse, foster healing, &amp; rebuild the trust of both survivors &amp; the general public in MSU. https://t.co/8etKyCtHJ7 #ShutdownStories Workers “don’t know how that next car payment is going to be made. How are [they] going to get to work if [they] lose [their] car? Where are [they] going to stay if [they] can’t make the rent payment? They’ve hung us out to dry.” 
–Paul, TSA Officer #ShutdownStories Christopher, Airway Transportation Systems specialist, said many safety inspectors aren't on the job causing regular safety checks to not be completed. Workers "are having to pick up 2nd &amp; 3rd jobs.” Christopher works 40 hrs at Bradley &amp; 20-35 hrs at a ice rink. #ShutdownStories “It’s more nerve-wracking because of the fact that if this shutdown lasts any longer one of us is going to have to find something [else].” 
–Sarah, TSA Officer #ShutdownStories “we have no income right now… I still have to pay the bills. To feel like we’re poker chips or leverage is very infuriating. We are people. We have lives—not just a number to throw around. I want the government to reopen.” 
–Adrian, Behavior Detection Officer https://t.co/29YXKtWlsr On Monday, I heard directly from workers @Bradley_Airport about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting their families &amp; lives. Today, I share their stories on the Senate floor &amp; with you.👇 Sad to learn of the passing of legal giant &amp; friend, Patricia Wald. She fought for justice all of her life, becoming the 1st woman to serve as Chief Judge of the DC Circuit. Her life story is an inspiration. https://t.co/GwgNjb5fY4 Corporations &amp; foreign governments seem to be attempting to shortcut government scrutiny by funneling tens of thousands of dollars to Trump &amp; his family’s business. A classic case of corruption right here in our nation’s capital. Want your controversial merger approved by the Trump administration? Grease the wheels by booking a stay at the Trump Hotel. https://t.co/NJnvJZENpg Big tech cannot be trusted to write its own rules. The only ‘grand bargain’ on privacy is one that imposes real accountability. I look forward to rolling out bipartisan legislation that puts consumers first. https://t.co/Yt14Oxp2kw From what we saw today, Barr has yet to quell the fear or make the proper commitment that he will not deflect &amp; deny access to the full findings of the Mueller investigation. Barr wouldn’t even pledge to tell Congress what he edited/deleted from the Special Counsel report before he shares it with Congress &amp; the American people. Not a reassuring pledge of transparency. Today Barr told me, "there are two different reports… Under the current regulations, the Special Counsel report is confidential. The report that goes public would be a report by the Attorney General." The American people deserve the Mueller Report, not the Barr Report. RT @AC360: "We will never see the Mueller report. Neither Congress nor the public will ever see the Special Counsel report if William Barr… RT @AC360: Democratic @SenBlumenthal tells @AndersonCooper that Trump's appointee for AG, William Barr, intends to bury Mueller's report an… I asked AG nominee Barr if he still believes Roe v. Wade should be overruled. Mr. Barr didn’t say no. https://t.co/uC4ceRcMVM There are a lot of ways President Trump could stymie the Special Counsel investigation without firing him. During my questioning, Barr gave incomplete answers or refused to commit to: https://t.co/MJmj3EA0OE Neomi Rao’s inflammatory discussion of race, rape, &amp; LGBT rights cannot be condoned with a lifetime appointment. Filling Kavanaugh’s seat with a judge who blames victim &amp; dismisses survivors by writing “and if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice,” is despicable &amp; disturbing. https://t.co/zdFRLiIVVa RT @ConnAFLCIO: Thank you @SenBlumenthal for supporting these federal workers as they enter the 24th day of the government shutdown -- now… The Trump administration's continued attempts to limit women’s birth control access are thwarted once again by the courts. Women—not their employers—must be able to make their own decisions about how to best care for their reproductive health.  https://t.co/qw89DBwISo RT @CNNSitRoom: “I think that there is an obligation to subpoena the notes and if necessary the interpreter because we are talking here abo… RT @CNNSitRoom: .@SenBlumenthal: “These revelations are absolutely stomach-turning.

The shutdown is punishing victims of domestic violence by pushing organizations that help survivors of sexual abuse, human trafficking, &amp; elder abuse to reduce their services. https://t.co/9fp7ji2BCq Tough questions for AG nominee tomorrow about protecting the Special Counsel, providing full disclosure of his evidence, restricting pardon power abuse, standing up to Trump, &amp; much more. Barr must give specific ironclad commitments. All roads lead to the Kremlin—a preview of coming attractions in the Special Counsel Report. Full disclosure is absolutely necessary. https://t.co/tvLrmItu0B Fierce fight vital to defeat any over reaching plan to privatize &amp; dismantle VA health care.  Protecting veterans will be staunchly &amp; steadfastly bipartisan—uniting our Senate VA Comm. https://t.co/Exr4KFG4Tl Are you proud, Mr. President—as you said you would be—of the longest shutdown in American history? A tragic travesty. Another significant piece in the mosaic: FBI had enough evidence of national security danger to start a counterintelligence investigation of Trump even before Special Counsel’s criminal investigation. Now Mueller must resolve both &amp; protect our nation against any ongoing threat. A bombshell revelation: Trump’s possible collaboration with Russians so alarmed the FBI as a national security threat they opened a counterintelligence investigation. A sign of credible evidence &amp; real courage. Simply stunning &amp; unprecedented. The President of the United States under investigation for surreptitiously working with Russia, a conniving foreign adversary. https://t.co/jMeHLbwsTQ Allowing Medicare to negotiate prices, permitting affordable, safe drug imports, &amp; ensuring we pay the same for drugs as other countries are more than common sense measures; they are a mandate to improve our nation’s health. https://t.co/dQavYuwOEH RT @hardball: "He's encountering resistance within his own party." @SenBlumenthal on Trump and the government shutdown. #Hardball Just to be clear—the justice system has never worked this way. Alleged lawbreakers don’t get to edit the grand jury’s product. https://t.co/d8lHEtmxKM Thanks @hookerbeer &amp; local #CT brewers for sharing your #ShutdownStories.  It's not just federal workers being impacted by this lockout. Small businesses' innovation, success &amp; job creation are being significantly stalled. This shutdown must end. https://t.co/46SXp86sN8 Real people &amp; real lives are hurting. To the Senate ‘s Republican leadership: Let us do our jobs, vote to reopen the government, &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. Trump turns down his own party’s compromise—this petulant president always puts his ego first. How can Democrats reach a deal with Trump when GOP Senators can’t? https://t.co/GXqlKEwyRm Today I’m visiting craft brewers, like Thomas Hooker Brewery in Bloomfield—hearing about  devastating impacts of the #TrumpShutdown on them, our economy, &amp; jobs.https://t.co/cCK2IT9k1U
