The average age of a child involved in an accidental shooting is 3. And  over 17,000 children and teens are injured or killed by gun violence every year. We must do better. #enoughisenough #EndGunViolence Great to meet you and learn about Be The Match! https://t.co/yQTkpRxIAl Glad to see the House holding a hearing on climate change for the first time in 8 years.

But guns must be stored safely so they don‚Äôt end up in the hands of children, or those who would do themselves or others harm. https://t.co/9wabinvXaN Due to inclement weather, my office in Issaquah will be closed today. Stay safe and warm out there! Yet another attempt to restrict women's access to healthcare. Rather than creating medically unwarranted barriers to abortion care, how about focusing on real threats to women like maternal mortality? Make no mistake, delayed abortion only increases risk to women. Enough! https://t.co/wXhNbqEK55 If men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay. It‚Äôs that simple.
