Excited to bring some North Texas perspective to Congress! https://t.co/zNdPCOMKTw Just introduced legislation w/@RepJimmyPanetta to allow all Medal of Honor recipients &amp; POWs who are eligible for burial at Arlington Cemetery to receive a full military honors ceremony. Those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom deserve to be honored as heroes. üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/r5RUvJH98k Listen in to @660KSKY as I join @MarkDavis to discuss @POTUS‚Äôs second #SOTU address. üìª Tonight, @POTUS reminded us that extraordinary bipartisan accomplishments are possible and I couldn't agree more. My first month in office has proven there are many issues that bring us together as Americans and I know we can bring real, tangible change to Washington. https://t.co/nvvF7FTXPe At 9:00 PM ET, the President will address a joint session of Congress and outline his vision for 2019. What issues do you hope the President highlights during his second #SOTU address? https://t.co/LC4IDCrggB Met @SecWilkie at the White House to examine how we can improve veteran care. By modernizing the appeals process, utilizing electronic records, and expanding healthcare access we can give our veterans the care and treatment they deserve. https://t.co/vZjOUjuZUj We must have great schools to have a successful community &amp; public schools are a beacon in bringing businesses to Collin County. I‚Äôm excited to serve on the Education &amp; Labor Committee where I can bring input from local teachers &amp; parents to Washington. https://t.co/1IayjVZEUJ RT @NTxCommission: Great luncheon bringing our freshmen Congressmen together. Thank you @ColinAllredTX @RepVanTaylor and @RepRonWright for‚Ä¶ Joined @JasonWhitely @BudKennedy at @WFAA for the first time since I took office. Check out our discussion on our troops in Syria, security at our Southern Border, and my first month in Congress. https://t.co/RspHK0KOID https://t.co/vWN5TSusJv RT @scottorr300: @NTxCommission thrilled to be hearing from 3 of our new North Texas Congressmen. @RepVanTaylor @RepColinAllred @RepRonWrig‚Ä¶ Thanks for having me! https://t.co/iuOEIgXxw7 Kicked off my Valentines for Veterans program this morning at Boon Elementary in Allen! A small gesture means so much to those who have served and their families. https://t.co/c8nhkfGhDn Excited to see Plano represented on both sides of the field tonight! #SuperBowlLIII https://t.co/DyqoNEKZU8 Enjoyed meeting with constituents from Allen today and discussing the issues most important to them. I have always had a 100% meeting policy and will continue to do so in Congress. https://t.co/zv4UmAiY3e As border security negotiations get underway, I stopped by @NBCDFW to discuss our options moving forward. As a Marine, I served at the US - Mexico border. Physical borders work &amp; must be part of the solution when it comes to protecting Americans.. https://t.co/1IayjVZEUJ There is still time to participate in my Valentines for Veterans Program! Simply create valentines for local veterans and drop them off at my Plano office. My team and I will hand-deliver each valentine to veterans at the North Texas VA. INFO: https://t.co/14k53Xd5l4 https://t.co/3XGCTEOo6x Introduced legislation w/ Rep. @Malinowski to limit US troop reduction in Syria. I served in Iraq where we lived the creed, ‚Äúleave no one behind‚Äù - This applies to Americans fighting overseas as well as those fighting with us for the cause. INFO: https://t.co/7rTnueXnIF https://t.co/hTMBAtr4Wy Just wrapped up a conference call with education leaders in Collin County. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I look forward to working together with local educators, administrators, and parents to ensure our students receive the very best education possible. https://t.co/lAj6DsxgwH Honored to have been named to serve on the @EdLaborGOP Committee and the @HouseHomeland Security Committee for the 116th Congress. Not only are these important issues for Texas, but they are crucial to the continued success of our nation as a whole. https://t.co/LxOa1yTdK6 Tune in to @KSEV700 NOW (and @WBAP247NEWS later) as I join @ChrisSalcedoTX to discuss crime at our southern border and what we need to do in Washington to keep Americans safe. https://t.co/LuOPrMpS5L This week I cosponsored H.R. 20, the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act and H.R. 369, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act. As a father, I know how precious life is and will do everything in my power to protect innocent human life in Congress. https://t.co/9H0D98xBbt Tune in to 1160 AM KBDT now as I join @JPKathyandCrew live from Washington, DC - discussing government shutdown and border security.üéô Today, I delivered remarks on the @HouseFloor for the first time. I'm honored to speak from this historic dais &amp; for the opportunity to recognize my predecessor, Rep. Sam Johnson. While I will never be able to fill his shoes, I hope to follow in his footsteps. #TX03 https://t.co/p8lpkRHUsC U.S. national debt is at $21.9 trillion. The first bill I cosponsored in Congress proposes a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution. Americans have to balance their pocketbook, the State of Texas balances its budget, &amp; so should the Federal government. https://t.co/0Rts4Rmyq6 Disappointed Congress is heading home for another weekend while the government shutdown continues - but I‚Äôll be on the phones with Republicans and Democrats. Both sides should be working around the clock for the American people. Participated in a meeting at the White House to discuss border security this morning. It‚Äôs an incredible privilege to represent #TX03 in Congress and ensure Collin County has a seat at the table. https://t.co/SBS63Z4Hp9 Tune in to @660KSKY now as I join @MarkDavis to discuss the government shutdown, my first week in Congress, and how I plan to make Washington work again. After taking the oath this afternoon, I sent a letter to the CAO requesting my salary be withheld until Congress ends the government shutdown. Members of Congress should not be paid when critical federal employees, including our border patrol agents, are denied their paychecks. https://t.co/fsngMonQbE Honored to be sworn in to the 116th Congress today and proud to represent #TX03 in the U.S. House of Representatives! https://t.co/n9dAoWICjS
