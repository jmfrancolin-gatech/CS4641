On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet some amazing animals and the people who take care of them at the @sdhumane. Thank you for the incredible work you do for animal welfare. https://t.co/zdy0bLrPqr Wore white to #SOTU to honor women's suffrage. My constituents hoped to hear how the President was going to raise wages, lower healthcare costs &amp; end corruption. They didn't hear that. Instead, they heard a call for unity but on Trump's terms. That's not how bipartisanship works. https://t.co/3R2vRrvLax The Face of the Furloughed Feds. Honored to have furloughed federal worker and constituent Eric Schlumpf as my guest to the State of the Union. Eric missed two paychecks during the shutdown. #SOTU2019 https://t.co/oDI7nSJ8Dp I am Woman, Hear me roar! Great celebrating the incredible women of our community and the kickoff to #BlackHistoryMonth during Indivisible WATU Women of Color Roar breakfast. https://t.co/kJPs0aTDQb #LGBTQ Americans can be blocked from serving on juries based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. I reintroduced my bipartisan bill to end this discrimination.#Equality 

https://t.co/cV5uu12dDW Ten years ago yesterday, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to protect workers from pay discrimination. I was proud to support that bill and also proud to help introduce today the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure #equalpay for equal work. https://t.co/fvw1dolhfy The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, nearly twice as much as what he is demanding for his wall. Trump is running America like one of his bankrupt casinos - wasting money and running up deficits.

https://t.co/Mx0lCiQDv8 Excited to announce I've been named Chair of the Higher Ed &amp; Workforce Investment Subcommittee. I'll work to ensure that college is an attainable goal for students and look at expanding apprenticeship programs to let workers earn while they learn.
https://t.co/zOHy7070ra While I’m glad the President decided to listen to reason, this could have happened 5 weeks ago thus avoiding the unnecessary suffering by the American people, who don’t want a wall. Top priority now is to ensure fed workers get paid, including back pay. 
https://t.co/6LyAuIAnVr Innocent victims of the #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have passed ten bills to reopen the government, including funding for smart and effective border security, only to have them blocked by Senate Republicans. #EndTheShutdown 

https://t.co/E0GIdgwd57 Just voted for the ninth and tenth time today to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government. Many federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck because Trump is not getting his way. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/CgagMb8gAG Here are the results of my survey on the government shutdown. Thank you to all who responded. We had over 11,000 people take part. Keep in mind, this is not a scientific survey. https://t.co/brLqEPDUmk Right now #transgender troops are serving capably and courageously to protect the American people. This ruling is an insult to their sacrifice. If the Supreme Court won't uphold the ideals of America then we will fight to do so.

https://t.co/7kXKYmoOzG His words resonate with even greater importance today. #MLKDay https://t.co/Rx9ZdAnfHS My latest survey is out. I hope you'll take a few minutes to send me your opinions on the government shutdown.

https://t.co/34kQitxkxR Get ready for Team Davis in Casa de Oro! Have a question or need help with a federal agency? Then come down to my Office Hours. My staff will be on hand to answer your questions and see if we can help. https://t.co/klUzLhT98U https://t.co/8MaD05BEzp During these times, it couldn’t be more important that the administration follows our constitution to include all citizens for an accurate population count. Proper representation and resources are on the line. The spirit of our democracy is at stake.

https://t.co/7KIpkRKK1G It’s a pleasure to have such a capable colleague as @RepScottPeters.  We are energized by the 116th Congress and working together for San Diego and the country! https://t.co/vzPVRdq1r2 Get ready because here we are!

https://t.co/HJuEJ1sxj4 Our nation's 42,000 Coast Guard members and 50,000 Coast Guard retirees are not getting paid. How can the president think it’s a good idea for national security to not pay those who protect us? #EndtheShutdown #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/qD1p3JEZO4 An increase in the minimum wage for America is long overdue. Proud to join in introducing legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. #RaiseTheWage https://t.co/Y40cAAtPVm Our economy is about to take a hit that will cost more than what Trump is demanding for his wall. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government. #EndTheShutdown 

https://t.co/oKpoXFh78U RT @BobbyScott: There is no place in America where someone working full time &amp; making the $7.25 federal minimum wage can make ends meet. To… For the past two weeks, @HouseDemocrats have been passing bills to reopen the government #ForThePeople and will be doing so again this week. Senate Republicans and the President are the only ones standing in the way of ending the #TrumpShutdown. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/A1le2C4A7p There is no safety net for the safety net. Millions of Americans are at risk of hunger and evictions. The president continues to hurt Americans who are already hurting. Let's end the #trumpshutdown and reopen the government!

https://t.co/bTqlfizaHj If there truly is an immediate national security crisis at the border, why is the only solution a wall that will take years and years to complete? There is a smarter approach we can take to border security than wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/wqoFztQu5x Last week, my House colleagues and I voted to reopen the government – and this week, we’re doing it again. The House just voted to fund the Treasury Department and the IRS to ensure tax refunds are not delayed. I urge the Senate to take up this bill and end the #TrumpShutdown. Undoing the #ACA would send our country back to a time when being a woman was a pre-existing condition. I’m fighting against GOP efforts to dismantle the care you’ve come to count on. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/9uxrNAs7he First, it's spelled "forest." Second, a majority of the forest land in California is controlled by the federal government. Third, what kind of person hurts fellow Americans who are already hurting?

https://t.co/iOoYZcRetP 97% of Americans support passing commonsense background check laws – and yet these bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. Proud to join in the introduction of #HR8 today - the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. #NeverAgain The 116th Congress is underway. Tell me the issues you would like to see Congress focus on. Please take my survey.

https://t.co/n3OETWPA4R Filed my first bills in the #116thCongress! My election reform bills have been included in the #ForThePeople Act (#HR1) - the House Democrats' anti-corruption, campaign finance and election reform initiative.

https://t.co/MUVwEJ6e0z With bipartisan support, the House passed two bills to restore government services to the American people and provide paychecks to federal workers. It's time for Congress to be the adult in the room and end the #TrumpShutdown.

https://t.co/euRlvvYTDL Excited to be part of this most diverse historic Congress with our Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The joy of seeing families, children and a Congress that looks more like America is an honor and moment of optimism I will always cherish with gratitude  to my constituents. #116Congress https://t.co/5DyNkisytR The 116th Congress starts now! Watch a live stream of the swearing-in of House members and the vote for Speaker.

https://t.co/TNoTPToV7h Congratulations to Judge Sabraw for being selected as the San Diego Person of the Year. His commitment to upholding people's constitutional rights helped put an end to Trump's inhumane family separation policies.

https://t.co/YeC2CCpBZ8 Another child dies in custody. My condolences to the family who held out hope for a better life circumstance for their son. Investigations are only the first step in addressing yet another tragedy.

https://t.co/mHORd5RVly Another victim of the #TrumpShutdown is the Violence Against Women Act. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government so women can continue to access these critical resources.

https://t.co/7MS6Pn2HyO Someone who says they care about national security doesn't force federal law enforcement officers to work without pay. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/3ctXibG6xl Wishing Justice Ginsburg a speedy recovery. #RBG

https://t.co/HljVficxeS The #TrumpShutdown will only hurt people and San Diego’s economy. I voted against border wall funding in the House and it will be voted down in the Senate. The GOP controls all levers of government and has the responsibility to govern responsibly. #NoBorderWall https://t.co/IbefNio6w5 Federal criminal justice reform is long overdue. Glad to have joined my colleagues in voting for the bipartisan First Step Act. This bill paves the way toward a fairer and more equal criminal justice system.

https://t.co/4G5F7dWvbu There are two entry-level employment opportunities in my office—one in San Diego and one in D.C. Please help spread the word and encourage qualified people you know to apply.

https://t.co/5neIhl7lbC Don't forget about my San Carlos Office Hours tomorrow! https://t.co/KTQp8sHmSJ Trump needs to treat #climatechange like the devastating threat it poses. Joined in calling on him to heed the dire warnings of the climate change report of his government detailing catastrophic results if we ignore this real problem. #ActOnClimate

https://t.co/A9NWdYDavf You can still get covered, California! The Texas court ruling has no impact on your ability to sign up for health insurance. The deadline to be covered by January 1 has been extended until Friday, December 21.

Get covered at https://t.co/6mz6Hd5daF https://t.co/s9T18xWtBa GOP lost the midterms due to its radical opposition to the #ACA. This outrageous ruling shows that what Republicans can't get through Congress, they'll try to get through the courts. The Supreme Court must reverse this baseless lawsuit. #ProtectOurCare

https://t.co/Uzp66xXL9G Get ready for Team Davis in San Carlos. Have a question or need help with a federal agency? Then come down to my San Carlos Office Hours. My staff will be on hand to answer your questions and see if we can help. https://t.co/q8ReaMOFJg Sat down with minimum wage earners and heard how they struggle to make ends meet. It's time to give Americans a raise and increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. #RaisetheWage #Fightfor15 https://t.co/nQT4stigw4 This move to put polluters before people will hit CA hard putting our water and health at risk. It ignores science, law, and strong public support for commonsense protections for clean water. #ProtectCleanWater

https://t.co/r1wrNbYzMc Still time to get health insurance through Covered California. If you are eligible, you could receive financial assistance to help cover the costs. As always, my office is available to answer any questions you may have.

Go to https://t.co/6mz6Hd5daF to sign up! https://t.co/wKkuiA7UeK Honored to be present for this celebration of life for our 41st President, George H. W. Bush. How much we have learned of his leadership style that should inspire others. https://t.co/ZVk0HP2eUM Our veterans should not be shortchanged on their education benefits because of a computer glitch. I'm calling on the VA to ensure #veterans get their benefits and those veterans who were underfunded are made whole.

https://t.co/GNLQEFM93e Very few lived a life of public service that President George H.W. Bush led. He was a consummate gentleman statesman. My sincere condolences to the Bush family. Since the end of #NetNeutrality, internet speeds are already being slowed. Congress must vote to protect internet access and freedom by restoring net neutrality.

https://t.co/9wXuTQ2JCJ Delighted to share constituent service tips at House Freshman Orientation. This new class of Rep-Elects was up early and asking questions that showed they are ready to get to work! https://t.co/pu1sm8SfSW Happening today! Team Davis will be on hand to answer your questions about how my office can help with federal agencies. https://t.co/F3OBwW3L9q The president’s own scientists say that #climatechange is having a devastating effect. From deadly wildfires here in CA to destructive hurricanes on the east coast, we’ve seen a lot just this year. Climate change is real &amp; serious action is long overdue.

https://t.co/z2G52Z4hyM Team Davis will be in Skyline to answer your questions about help with federal agencies. Hope you can make it to my Skyline Office Hours on Wednesday! https://t.co/rZBag94ikT Vast majority of migrants seek a better life–not confrontations with law enforcement.

https://t.co/47SBvbYm8p I've had the opportunity to visit many #apprenticeships in San Diego and around the country. As we recognize #NationalApprenticeshipWeek this week, I am committed to expanding these programs to create quality, high-paying careers. https://t.co/PEPs0Znq0q I join survivors, advocates, and colleagues in asking the administration to withdraw this proposal and start again. This #TitleIX proposal turns back the clock on years of work that survivors &amp; advocates have done to protect students on campuses. I've heard from schools &amp; students concerned about the confusion and lack of accountability this new proposal would cause.

https://t.co/DA4tErX23M Hunted to the brink of extinction in the 1970’s, Gray Wolves are making a comeback thanks to the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. However, they are still in jeopardy. I opposed the GOP bill to remove them from the ESA. We need to #StopExtinction. https://t.co/8WSWKlSc0Q Extremely saddened by the destruction from the fires across our state. So many lives lost and still many more people unaccounted for. I stand in support of our firefighters and first responders who are battling the fires and helping affected families.

https://t.co/m32h2vkjbA As co-chair of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Caucus, I joined in thanking and welcoming EOD servicemembers to the Capitol as they talked about the work they do to protect our servicemembers from IEDs. https://t.co/dH1LAoCLIC Happy #VeteransDay! Thanks to everyone who came out to honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans on this beautiful day. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/hzk8ash4VV As #VeteransDay approaches, we not only should thank #veterans for their service and sacrifice but ensure we are providing them with the benefits and care they deserve.

https://t.co/ryEjtlCfSi The most rewarding part of representing the 53rd Congressional District is the constituent services my office provides to the people.

https://t.co/XnK84bkW3p Grossmont College has a pre-apprenticeship program with Iron Workers Local 229 to help students get the skills to be successful after entering an #apprenticeship program. I saw the program in action &amp; discussed ways to expand apprenticeships, which my bill would help make happen. https://t.co/D6XHC2yQJm An overflowing and diverse crowd of thousands brought love and resolve to Temple Beth Israel - demonstrating how strongly San Diegans reject hate and division. So proud of everyone who stood up and said: Not Here! Not Anywhere!

https://t.co/PDmf9XDgcg I applaud the great work our community is doing to understand the issues, collaborate to find solutions, and support our incredible military families. And I took a selfie for their selfie contest! #SDMFCAC18 #BuildingCommunity At @sdmilfam conference, I spoke on how we can work together to address military spouse unemployment, expand military childcare, improve transition assistance programs and ensure that servicemembers receive enough information about education benefits #SDMFCAC18 #BuildingCommunity https://t.co/fkLTWrZpJh Happening today! Team Davis will be on hand at the Mission Hills Branch Library to answer your questions about how we might be able to help with a federal agency. https://t.co/IfyyX4AYId More hate. More tragedy.

While the economy is booming for some, too many are not feeling the benefits. We can start by raising wages. https://t.co/6jIBjXyAow Time is running out to avoid the worst effects of #climatechange. We must believe in science, end the rollbacks of environmental protections, rejoin the #ParisAgreement and work toward reducing carbon pollution. Our future depends on it. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/J0ph5EUfFV Joined local letter carriers in denouncing Trump's plan to privatize the USPS. If mail is privatized, private companies will drive up prices on businesses &amp; consumers. That’s bad news.

TY to our veterans &amp; the many volunteers supporting those who served. https://t.co/Mun53tfHat As one of 200 Representatives who filed this lawsuit against Trump, pleased to see the case move forward.

Joined my colleague, Chairman Brett Guthrie, to host a hearing on ways to expand apprenticeship programs. Thanks to Mr. Mark Kessenich for testifying to the importance of keeping high-quality standards in apprenticeships. https://t.co/mtjY6LE6cg Trump is under criminal investigation and should not be choosing justices who could decide his fate.

#LaborDay2018 https://t.co/EsSEDo9KkY The memorial service for John McCain should inspire us all to reflect on what "greatness" in a nation is all about. Sacrifice for something greater than ourselves. And we should act with the abiding belief: we are all in this together.

https://t.co/0oe61z1Pku Can you think of a more outrageous resource policy shift??? https://t.co/1e61iztGCK My bill - the Military Hunger Prevention Act - is a bipartisan, common-sense solution to military families who are not able to put food on the table.

https://t.co/TFU7hFO0n8 Thank you, Admiral McRaven.

https://t.co/E3aOHzbg78 Secretary DeVos’ decision to eliminate gainful employment protections for students is yet another instance of this administration putting corporations before people.

I'm committed to pushing for passage of the Women's Health Protection Act to protect a woman's reproductive rights. #CommitToRoe @NARAL I've heard from countless businesses and students in San Diego about expanding quality #apprenticeships. I joined with Congressman Brett Guthrie to introduce the APPRENTICE Act to do just that! 
https://t.co/e8nGlUCrhH… https://t.co/BEDWuY46JP Please join me for my next Town Hall: August 4 at Southwestern Community College. I look forward to hearing from you! Please click the link to RSVP.

https://t.co/or41AC1D63 https://t.co/VPtVzTx3GK Russia continues to be a threat to our democracy. Yet the GOP wants to cut funding for election security. I joined with Democrats in forcing a vote in the House to restore this critical funding. #ProtectOurDemocracy

https://t.co/9ulC77c6en In response to constituent interest, I’ve invited world-renowned experts for a panel discussion on the current state of US/Russia relations. Discussion will cover Trump’s summit with Putin, a history of US/Russia relations &amp; more. Click the link to RSVP.
https://t.co/xWNCd7Xcu9 https://t.co/39ni1Vac9Q Turns out Trump's meeting with Putin was nothing but an own goal. #HelsinkiSummit https://t.co/eEgEQKCXfR Honored to accept the @congressfdn first ever "Life in Congress" Workplace Environment Award.  When it comes to my staff, my approach is--Trust their talent, Believe in them, Get out of their way! #DemocracyAwards https://t.co/sIvxG41Ar0 Having a prepared workforce with access to high-quality jobs is key to economic growth and a strong middle class. I joined with @RepGuthrie in holding first-ever event of the bipartisan Congressional #Apprenticeship Caucus to explore expanding quality apprenticeship programs. https://t.co/y69jqq9ZY2 I’ll fight this lawsuit no matter how long it takes. Attacks on equality &amp; the #LGBTQ community still exist &amp; we will stand up to them at every turn. The #Pride Flag is needed more than ever. Confident the appellate court will rule on the side of equality.
https://t.co/4NhKWLkhyA Here's your chance to weigh in on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Take my survey and let me know what you think.

https://t.co/9nMkcFooL7 Trump’s decision is more about protecting himself than protecting the rights of people to determine their own health and economic future. #WhatsAtStake 

https://t.co/P4q0FYzgKK Leader McConnell should apply his own rule to this nominee and allow the American people to have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #WhatsAtStake 

https://t.co/LYCyfcVXsV Trump promised to drain the swamp and should have fired Pruitt a long time ago. Instead, he was allowed to rack up ethics violation after ethics violation. His record on the environment is even worse. His replacement should know that we will fight this assault on the environment. @LeonardoVaneg17 Welcome to DC!  You can get Gallery passes at my office in 1214 Longworth. Office will be open at 9 AM on Thursday. It is with great honor that I joined these service men and woman of our armed forces as they become U.S. Citizens. Their commitment to serve and to this country will add to the fabric of our country. https://t.co/V0Y9yQ2nUi It feels great to be recognized for the way our office functions every day! A good work environment produces good work and sets an example as we push for fair and friendly workplace policies throughout the country. #DemocracyAwards

https://t.co/LrSKYm6L8t Honored to be selected by San Ysidro Health as a "2018 Health Champion."  Community health centers such as San Ysidro Health perform the critical work of providing care to our most vulnerable populations. Their staff and providers are the true champions. https://t.co/A7plYsdm9g So inspired by the veterans, service providers &amp; volunteers at Stand Down, which connects homeless veterans with services &amp; support. Thanks to the many courageous veterans who spoke with me one on one about ways Congress can help. I commend you and thank you for your service! https://t.co/Ki5wqtxNBp I voted NO with 300 of my colleagues on the GOP immigration bill which would waste taxpayer dollars on building a wall and would not reunite separated families or provide real solutions for #Dreamers.

https://t.co/NUrIl8CIKu The future of our democracy is on the line in the appointment of the next Supreme Court justice. As Leader McConnell has stated: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.” We have the benefit of an election in 132 days. Disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. As a former school board member, I saw firsthand that everyone who is represented in their workplace by a negotiating process enjoys the benefits of union leadership. #JANUSvsAFSCME 

https://t.co/l5zghexL2p The Supreme Court failed the American people today. We look to our courts to uphold our constitution and the ideal of equality. No one should be treated differently based on their country of origin. #NoMuslimBanEver 

https://t.co/uba5HZKa35 Looks like the GOP finally found a way to pay for its massive $2 trillion tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.

https://t.co/CrRIvRRRHO I helped pass bipartisan legislation to expand treatment coverage for opioid addiction through Medicare and Medicaid. This is a key tool in this fight but we will need a greater investment if are going to end this crisis.

https://t.co/MN0axI0UrK We should have zero tolerance for intolerance. I will vote NO on the Republican legislation to build a wall and will continue pushing for the reunification of children with their parents. #KeepFamilesTogether https://t.co/RUq0HuARQT My colleague and friend @repjohnlewis inspired the Aaron Price Fellows to "Get in the Way" and "Never Get Lost in a Sea of Despair." https://t.co/oAp7jm0V4v Enjoyed thoughtful Q and A with the Aaron Price Fellows today.  Great questions! We talked mostly about how Congress really works, how young people can make a difference and about current border issues. https://t.co/Wor4HALsQ8 When we should be reuniting children separated from their families, the GOP immigration bills spend billions of dollars on a wall &amp; don't protect Dreamers or asylum-seeking families. Voting NO on both bills. Speaker Ryan needs to work on a bipartisan &amp; humane immigration bill. Since thousands of children are still detained and separated from their families, the Administration owes it to the American people to tell us exactly how and when they plan to reunite them. #KeepFamliesTogether 

https://t.co/1hIRg28kto In a time when our refugee and immigrant communities are under attack by this administration, we have to remember that they are here contributing to the fabric of our country and to the economic stability of our nation. I stand #WithRefugees. https://t.co/vD9YCRtP4d Since this administration refuses to treat families humanely, Congress must step up and do the right thing. I am cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct in the House which would prevent migrant families from being ripped apart. While we celebrate #Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery in America, the struggle for equality and justice continues. We will not relent in our work to preserve and protect freedom. https://t.co/zisfI5Fnsw Joined my colleagues in inspecting facilities holding migrant children in the San Diego region &amp; repeated my demand that the Trump Administration stop separating families. America should have a zero tolerance policy for the immoral treatment of children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/uMNutc9yab EPA Chief Scott Pruitt's distaste for environmental safeguards seems to only be surpassed by his lack of moral integrity. It’s long past time for him to go.

https://t.co/SKbXjozQe5 President Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a historic summit in Singapore. What do you think?

https://t.co/4bC52VtgCS On this World Blood Donor Day, let's raise awareness of the need for blood donation and of the vital work done by blood centers. You too can help save a life by donating. #WBDD2018 https://t.co/kZqdu1HLds Trump's FCC begins the unfortunate repeal of #netneutrality. Internet service providers can now to restrict access to sites and increase costs to all Americans who use the web. Senate voted to restore net neutrality, I’ll keep pushing for a vote in the House. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/tkZ0yglHPc I'm calling on the Defense Secretary to reject the transgender ban in the military. #Transgender Americans are serving and have served honorably and courageously. This policy does not make us stronger. #Equality #LGBTQI https://t.co/zfBCJ7JYnv Not talking about abortions doesn't prevent them, it only increases the rate of unsafe abortions. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar couldn't answer why this counterproductive policy is in place, given how detrimental it is to women's overall health. #GlobalGagRule https://t.co/dNiK45INz1 Each year Congress hosts the Congressional App Challenge as a way for young people to show off their STEM &amp; computer science skills. Winner receives some great prizes &amp; an invitation to come to DC to show off their app! For more info &amp; to sign up, visit:
https://t.co/hk4mDuIOlD https://t.co/6tnwODDcKd One year ago today Donald Trump ceded the United States’ role as a leader on climate by withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement. But today I’m proud to stand with @SEEC &amp; @CaucusOnClimate to tell the world that we are #StillIn the fight against climate change. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/g0PzGSyv6q The end of #NetNeutrality will hurt consumers and small businesses. Congress needs to overturn the FCC's ruling which lets Internet Service Providers decide what websites you can access and whether they want to charge you more for that access. https://t.co/WDozXIWZzX I pressed Secretary DeVos on whether she is committing enough resources to protect teachers in this program. I will be following up with the Department of Education to make sure it is keeping its promise to these teachers.

https://t.co/fsIJKPmfbw HHS needs to look at their policies and make sure they are doing all they can to keep children safe. This administration also needs to stop the inhumane practice of separating families at the border. We need to protect families, not separate them.

https://t.co/A4tUpPkMc0 @SUHSD @Zer0C00LQ Good news! Thanks so much for rectifying this. Tax cuts don't pay for themselves. The GOP/Trump Tax Scheme is projected to create deficits that will hit $1 trillion. The Bush tax cuts, which I also opposed, turned a budget surplus into massive deficits. How is this fiscal responsibility?

https://t.co/TYHvUYclIJ #MemorialDay https://t.co/WXgPaMbiIK @SUHSD @Zer0C00LQ Thanks for looking into this, @SUHSD.   Please let me know how this has been resolved. Updates on my trip to Afghanistan, border sewage, national security, net neutrality, and more are all in my latest newsletter. You can read it here and you can also sign up to have it sent straight to your inbox.

https://t.co/tVfi79IzVg Thanks to everyone from Taylor Guitars, Deering Banjo and others from the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) for advocating for more music education. I agree--music in our schools is important! https://t.co/PSyhrCoYad Honored to have my staff present a proclamation for Balboa Park’s 150th Anniversary. Balboa Park is the jewel of San Diego - loved for its nature, culture, arts &amp; history. I’m proud to have this amazing landmark in my district. Congratulations to all who make Balboa Park an icon! https://t.co/l9bfkFYsex I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Secretary doesn’t know how many people on her staff are working on this important issue. #DeVosHearing 
https://t.co/Heq0iBCGTd Thank you for your thoughtful suggested questions for Secretary DeVos! I wish I could have asked them all but I will submit them to her to answer for the record. I focused on getting justice for students who have been defrauded by predatory for-profit schools. After almost 2 years in office, Secretary DeVos will appear before the Ed &amp; Workforce Comm tomorrow. What would you like me to ask her? Can't promise I'll use your question as I'll only have 5 min but will do my best to get real answers about the direction of our public schools. https://t.co/U3TiuuuZrU
