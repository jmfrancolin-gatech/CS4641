This crucial legislation - endorsed by the Administration, policy experts, and the business community - will ensure the US remains the leading Pacific power for generations to come. I urge President Trump to immediately halt any plans to withdraw US troops from Syria and to consult with Congress on a long-term Syria strategy that protects US national interests and denies a win for Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, and the Iranian mullahs. The US is the only global power able to stop Russia, Iran, &amp; their terrorist proxies in Syria from total control of a region vital to national security. We've made significant progress in our fight against ISIS but the fight isn't over, &amp; a US withdrawal will embolden bad actors.

I‚Äôll never forget the images and video of the brave women and men running into danger to help save thousands of people on 9/11. After all these heroes have done for us, our nation cannot and will not turn its back on them. It may not be the most talked about issue in our state today, but Jason‚Äôs confirmation late last evening is truly good news for Colorado. I look forward to his swearing in soon. Jason has a long record of  public service, leadership in his community, and the integrity this position requires. Bob Troyer did great work for our state for several years, and Jason will be expected to follow the strong track record Bob will leave at the office. United States Attorneys serves as the nation's principal litigators under the direction of the Attorney General. They handle cases ranging from terrorism and national security to drug crackdowns and money laundering along with a whole lot in between. Yesterday evening Jason Dunn was confirmed as the next US Attorney for the District of Colorado. While this isn‚Äôt the most high profile vote here‚Äôs why this is so important for our state: Great news coming for Colorado tomorrow. Standby! RT @NREL: NREL's Juan Torres met with @SenCoryGardner before testifying at a Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee hearing - @EnergyG‚Ä¶ This bipartisan letter has triggered an investigation and Global Magnitsky sanctions determination after Khashoggi went missing last Tuesday after entering a Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
https://t.co/G2pid8v8D6 I sent a letter yesterday with more than a dozen of my colleagues to President Trump regarding the recent disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. RT @AliABCNews: .@SenCoryGardner on Kashoggi: "I think it's a pretty glaring red line that we're about to see. You have people on one side‚Ä¶ @TheWxMeister Good morning Matt! Absolutely. Please call Alex in my office: 202-224-0926. My colleague @SenBennetCO and I were sent here to work together. We have our disagreements but we have always fought for the best for our state and I hope that every colleague of mine in Congress will do the same. We have our political disagreements and we should cherish the rights to express our disagreements. But when it comes to calls for violence and attempted murder and assassinations this country has gone too far and it‚Äôs time we step back from that brink. You have other party leaders saying Michelle Obama was wrong when she said "when they go low we go high." But rather when they go low "we kick them." This is not who we are. Just before I voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh, my wife received a text message of a graphic beheading. We now have public officials saying you should be uncivil to each other - a call for incivility. I‚Äôm confident that we will be able to continue to build on the strong foundation she solidified in her role as UN Ambassador. Because of @nikkihaley's leadership, the United States has a powerful voice again at the United Nations. She‚Äôs been an incredible partner to work closely with on carrying out the Administration‚Äôs maximum pressure doctrine on North Korea.

https://t.co/9z0rCvLz33 ICYMI: Along with Land and Water Conservation Fund legislation, several other important initiatives for Colorado that I have backed advanced through Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday. Today was a huge step forward for #LWCF @LWCFCOALITION. Legislation to permanently authorize and fully fund the program passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with my support. https://t.co/essbekYSVd It‚Äôs always a pleasure meeting with educators from our great state. On Tuesday, Joe Simo, the 2018 Colorado Principal of the Year from Centennial Middle School in Montrose stopped by my office to talk about his ideas to improve education in CO. https://t.co/z0qhid9YiY This announcement is good for Ft. Carson, CO, and most importantly the right decision for our military. We made the case to the Army that Fort Carson‚Äôs incredible infrastructure, manpower, and support will guarantee an effective increase in the Army‚Äôs readiness and capabilities. I announced today with @SenBennetCO that after several meetings over the course of the past year with Army leadership, the Army will stand up a Stryker Brigade Combat Team at Ft. Carson in Colorado Springs. My prayers are with the Gaiter family. Lew Gaiter was a man of integrity, serving as Larimer County Commissioner for years while battling cancer. His leadership &amp; devotion to family &amp; community will be missed. The impact he left on us will not be forgotten. I will miss my friend. Complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization is United States and international law. These steps are important - inspectors must have full, unfettered access and accounting. https://t.co/FLl21tYJWc In the meantime, the Trump administration should immediately increase its diplomatic efforts to compel every entity ‚Äî Russian or otherwise ‚Äî to comply with international sanctions against North Korea. Without this pressure, North Korea will not denuclearize. We urge the Panel not to cave to Russian pressure and to release the original version of the report. Countries not applying pressure are enabling North Korea's advancing nuclear weapons program. Russia is acting in bad faith, and we join Ambassador Haley‚Äôs call for transparency and accountability on sanctions enforcement at the United Nations against North Korea. .@senmarkey &amp; I joined @nikkihaley today in condemning Russian interference with a key UN Panel of Experts report concerning NK sanctions &amp; calling for the release of the original version of the report, which implicates Russian entities in sanctions violations. I hosted a roundtable Tuesday in GJ that focused on the importance of Jordan Cove. This project would take liquified natural gas and turn it into fuel exports, creating a great source of energy in the US. Check out @dwebb40‚Äôs article to read more about it. https://t.co/7GzfFlnGX2 This is great news ‚Äì the House Natural Resources Committee just passed a measure to reauthorize LWCF. There‚Äôs bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We need to get the job done to fund #LWCF. https://t.co/NhocI09Ryc RT @DeanBobbyBraun: Great to be in @SenCoryGardner‚Äôs hometown today with his regional director Darlene and visiting Yuma High School to sho‚Ä¶ RT @RepTipton: Yesterday, I hosted a roundtable discussion w/ @SenCoryGardner on the importance of the Jordan Cove Project.

I appreciated their insights as we discussed the legislation I‚Äôve introduced to help stop this crisis. https://t.co/Gz7YRqqSNT RT @nielslesniewski: Following NBC report about sonic attacks, @SenCoryGardner renews calls for declaring Russia a state sponsor of terror‚Ä¶ This includes the invasion of Ukraine, the support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria, and assassinations on foreign soil. Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism, and it is time we treat them that way. Vladimir Putin cannot continue to operate with impunity and it is time we impose tough and lasting consequences for Russia‚Äôs actions that undermine civilized norms and international law. As the facts of this heinous act are further ascertained, I urge the Senate to pass my legislation requiring the State Department to consider the designation of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, and a comprehensive sanctions package against Russia I introduced last month. If these reports are true, this is a direct attack by Russia against the United States. https://t.co/CaO3LQWKXU Seventeen years ago the United States experienced a horrendous act of evil and terror. We will #NeverForget the lives lost on 9/11 and we will continue to honor their memory. https://t.co/d25XO6foH3
