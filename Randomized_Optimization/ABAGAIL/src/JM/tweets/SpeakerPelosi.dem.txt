We must remove all doubt that they do, and say to them: we will have an economy that works for you. #ForThePeople As the House of Representatives opens the 116th Congress today in Washington, it will hold the election for the 63rd Speaker of the House.

Watch live 👇  https://t.co/wYCvCXbnoN During today’s meeting between @realDonaldTrump, myself &amp; other Democratic leaders, we asked the President to open up the government – giving him a path Republicans have supported previously. Why would he not do it? #TrumpShutdown .@realDonaldTrump has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly &amp; quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown – just the first sign of things to come in our new Democratic Majority committed to working #ForThePeople. https://t.co/CGl1euCotB Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/R0xRpL8c8W https://t.co/BRJv13FhOH Once the Senate passes this legislation and puts us on a path to reopening government, the President must come to his senses and immediately sign it into law. It would be the height of irresponsibility &amp; political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported. The President is using the #TrumpShutdown to try to force an expensive &amp; ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown. Our legislation reopens government services, ensures workers get the paychecks they’ve earned &amp; restores certainty to the lives of the American people. While @realDonaldTrump drags the nation into #TrumpShutdown Week 2 and sits in the White House &amp; tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess. RT @JoyAnnReid: Tune in next Friday, January 4th!! https://t.co/tqizjfp0KC Americans sent a clear message in November – they are tied of exactly the type of behavior that triggered the #TrumpShutdown. Congressman-elect Joe Neguse is working to start putting things right by passing the bold reforms in HR 1. https://t.co/ssSeLimXGl It is with great enthusiasm that I appoint @USRepKCastor as the Chair of our new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. We know she will bring great experience, energy &amp; urgency to confronting this existential threat. https://t.co/PtKVsvvxXk https://t.co/Ow3ukDfTuS The tragic death of an innocent child on Christmas Day breaks the hearts of all. Democrats call on Homeland Security’s Inspector General to immediately open an investigation into Felipe Alzono-Gomez’s death. https://t.co/on2E63hPhX https://t.co/pvNCtMJt9g As families across the country come together to celebrate, we wish joy &amp; comfort to you all. Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays! https://t.co/cCL4AJ1lMs As long as @realDonaldTrump is guided by the House @FreedomCaucus, it’s hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his #TrumpShutdown. .@realDonaldTrump wanted the #TrumpShutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it. Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what @realDonaldTrump would accept or not accept to end his #TrumpShutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment. Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, @realDonaldTrump is continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio &amp; TV hosts. It's Christmas Eve and @realDonaldTrump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve — after he just fired the Secretary of Defense. #TrumpShutdown By choosing to trigger the #TrumpShutdown, @realDonaldTrump is hampering important efforts to keep Americans safe. If Trump &amp; the GOP don’t stop holding America hostage to their radical policies, the Democratic Majority will act swiftly to reopen government in January. https://t.co/Ii5F6bIjNL If @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans choose to continue this #TrumpShutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January. Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, &amp; all of which include funding for strong, sensible, &amp; effective border security – not the president's ineffective and expensive wall. .@realDonaldTrump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a #TrumpShutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted. Republicans control the House, the Senate, &amp; the White House. But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, @realDonaldTrump threw a temper tantrum &amp; convinced the @HouseGOP to push our nation into a destructive #TrumpShutdown during the holiday season. Regrettably, America has now entered a #TrumpShutdown. RT @RulesDemocrats: Something smells in this Congress, and it’s the @HouseGOP calling an emergency meeting of the Rules Committee just 8 ho… RT @RulesDemocrats: “I’ve seen some surreal things around this place, but this is really something. Vital parts of our government are about… A #TrumpShutdown hurts the men &amp; women who keep us safe: taking away paychecks from 41,000 federal law enforcement &amp; corrections officers – plus nearly 90% of Homeland Security employees. https://t.co/dEho7pSSb7 Maybe @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP can’t imagine living paycheck to paycheck like most Americans. But the #TrumpShutdown will force nearly 800k federal employees to go without pay – right in the middle of the holidays. It’s the holiday season. Trump and Republican antics are causing shockwaves through the economy. Working families need certainty. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop holding America hostage, and keep government open &amp; working for the people. Food safety inspections will be curtailed. Identity theft victim services will be suspended. State and local law enforcement training programs will be stopped. All thanks to a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/aINYdkrtDI .@realDonaldTrump’s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall doesn’t make us safe, or honor our oath to protect &amp; defend our neighbors &amp; communities. And no matter much how he thinks a #TrumpShutdown will help him politically, it poses a real threat to American families. RT @RepMGS: I have a bunch of ideas for how to spend $5 BILLION and a wall aint one. https://t.co/WwBSV8MzXY RT @NancyPelosi: @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MXvDX3Xz1u @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MXvDX3Xz1u Democrats are for real border security solutions. Not for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on an immoral, ineffective &amp; expensive wall. We all take an oath to protect and defend our country. Border security is an important part of that oath. Your wall will fail in the Senate tomorrow, Mr. President. America cannot afford a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/8S7QJzAanT All Americans should take time to read General Mattis’s letter of resignation. It is a truly beautiful letter that speaks to our very best values as a nation. https://t.co/XY0mvqfv9q General Mattis was a comfort to many who were concerned about the path the Trump Admin would choose to take. His resignation letter is defined by statements of principle — principles that drove him to leave the Administration. All of us should be concerned at this time. We should be working to help hungry Americans, not take away their food. Yet under a new rule proposed by the Trump Admin (based on ideas the Congress rejected on a bipartisan basis), hundreds of thousands of ppl could lose nutrition assistance. This is the definition of cruelty.
