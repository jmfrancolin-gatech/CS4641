https://t.co/P3XeukI4kM @senatemajldr @POTUS Only one bill does all the bipartisan things I’ve discussed.

Only one bill has any chance of becoming law.

Let’s vote for it. @senatemajldr @POTUS Today, we’ll decide whether we turn a new corner and begin putting the last month behind us, or whether we will all continue to show up for work, stuck in exactly the same situation. @senatemajldr @POTUS The American people will see plainly which senators want to make a law and clean up this mess, and which senators are content to continue making political points and nothing else.

Making law versus making points. That’s the choice. @senatemajldr @POTUS That’s what this law provides. The border security we need plus actual, statutory authorization for DACA recipients -- written in law, for the first time. Not the unilateral hand-waving of the Obama administration. @senatemajldr So these commonsense physical barriers were a bipartisan point of agreement until about 5 mins ago. But the @POTUS went even further to win Democrats’ support. For example, his proposal also provides for 3-year legal status for certain individuals currently covered by DACA &amp; TPS. @senatemajldr Like the barriers in which many of my Democratic colleagues happily voted to invest billions of dollars during just the last Congress. @senatemajldr Barriers like the ones that the current Democratic Leader joined then-Senators Obama, Biden, and Clinton in supporting back in 2006.

Like the barriers constructed by President Obama’s own administration. @senatemajldr And it would direct about one one-thousandth of federal discretionary spending for physical barriers along the highest-priority sections of the border. @senatemajldr Well, if they agree with the need, they should agree with this modest proposal. 

It would fund new enforcement and surveillance technologies, recruiting and training hundreds of new Border Patrol agents… @senatemajldr “Certainly, you need barriers. And we support barriers,” said another. 

Not to be outdone, a third said, quote, “I’m a huge advocate of border security.” @senatemajldr The need for more security on our border is not a partisan invention. It is a fact. It’s a reality most Senate Democrats readily admit. 

“I’m willing to support more border security,” said one. @senatemajldr This legislation provides the resources that the men and women who risk their own safety to defend our border tell us are necessary. .@senatemajldr McConnell speaking now on Senate floor on government shutdown and border security proposal.
