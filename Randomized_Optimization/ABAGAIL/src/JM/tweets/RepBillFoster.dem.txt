Congratulations to Naperville North High School! #NSB2019 https://t.co/eFArfOWVOC .@JohnDingell’s commitment to public service made our country a better place. His work has helped millions of Americans get the health care they need. We will remember him as a fearless legislator whose life and legacy will be impossible to forget. https://t.co/dBaAkd1y3U I commend @GovPritzker and @KwameRaoul for their leadership on this important issue. The public health of the Willowbrook community should remain our top priority. https://t.co/QOQ5CDKROV Today, @RepTedDeutch and I introduced legislation to make sure immigrants held in detention centers are given information about their legal rights. https://t.co/arL4BXC1EK The science continues to show that #climatechange is real. A new study by @NASA and @NOAA found that global surface temperatures in 2018 were the fourth warmest since 1880. https://t.co/ACJEfklUIZ I am currently reviewing the new data from the air quality emissions tests. The public health of Illinois residents should remain our top priority. @EPA was established to protect the well-being of Americans, and I hope it will continue to honor that mission as we move forward. https://t.co/SxzXqijpnG Congress is finally getting its kicks and voting to honor #Route66 today. I’m proud to support legislation to establish a commission that will honor its history and legacy. It's time for @realDonaldTrump to accept the world in which we live &amp; not the world in which his political base would like to live. It's time to stop using falsehoods to undermine policies that made our country great &amp; work to strengthen our future. #SOTU https://t.co/pMPvkW4XuA It’s great to welcome Marilyn Weisner to the #SOTU this evening. Her work at the Aurora Food Pantry has helped hardworking families in our district put healthy food on the table. #StateOfTheUnion https://t.co/LrknGYf4bA 106 years ago today, Rosa Parks was born. We honor her courage that forever changed the course of history. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/oFqGr5ZnzS I am proud to announce that Marilyn Weisner, Executive Director of @aurorapantry will be my guest for the #SOTU address. https://t.co/lWZlDnYS9c I’m proud to join the House #Census Caucus and work with my colleagues to provide people with a better understanding of the important role the Census plays and to protect its integrity. https://t.co/k2rAbih63z I’m excited to continue my work with @HouseNewDems, @RepChrisPappas, @RepHaleyStevens, and @RepLBR  to understand the way automation and technology are changing the way we work. We need fact-based policies so that the American dream remains accessible to everyone. #FutureofWork https://t.co/fIPkXWOmMC Ten years after President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act, women are still battling the #wagegap. It's past time for the #PaycheckFairness Act. #Ledbetter10 Again, please talk to a scientist. https://t.co/9ZYP0X7QxD This would never happen at @Fermilab. 😂 https://t.co/nBnzFsaZBC I am relieved that we have finally found a temporary solution to reopen the government. The #TrumpShutdown was useless and accomplished nothing except provoking economic hardship, anxiety, and uncertainty in the lives of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/Xe2wWOSSsr The #DoomsdayClock remains two minutes to midnight. We all agree that nuclear deterrence is essential for our national security. It is vital that @realDonaldTrump engage with experts who have the technical knowledge to reduce the threat of these powerful weapons. https://t.co/TvurMQIJ66 On the anniversary of #RoevWade, I'm proud to stand with Americans who support a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. A majority of Americans agree that reproductive rights are human rights. #7in10forRoe Transgender service members serve in our military with honor and risk their lives for our country’s national security every day. They deserve nothing less than respect and support. https://t.co/PL9XbmpXtP Today, we recommit ourselves to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and follow his example of service to our communities and commitment to equality &amp; justice for every person. #MLKDay Anyone who purchased a copy of _The Art of the Deal_ should receive a refund. This offer is dead on arrival. Let us know when there’s a plan that doesn’t waste taxpayer money on fabrications for political gain. #TrumpShutDown https://t.co/P7KzOQvWRS I’m in Chicago this morning to listen to federal workers about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting their families. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/KvHILXKbOI I’m proud to announce my support for H.R. 1. It’s time to make our democracy work for all Americans and end political corruption. #ForThePeople https://t.co/gMi1BS5COY I’m in good company this Congress as we welcome more scientists to the #116thCongress. More technical backgrounds will help us tackle important issues like #climatechange and energy innovation. It’s time for Congress to get #backtoscience. https://t.co/Xsnu919m8G It was great to join my colleagues in the @ProChoiceCaucus and @DrLeanaWen to recommit ourselves to the fight for #healthcare for all women. #NoGagRule https://t.co/veRfa3IFE1 The #TrumpShutdown is now the longest shutdown in history and has hurt federal employees and hardworking families. @realDonaldTrump’s stunt has gone on long enough. https://t.co/KvWpq9sjc6 20 days into the #TrumpShutdown, we are starting to see the effects of @realdonaldtrump's reckless leadership. Federal workers will not receive a paycheck tomorrow. Crucial services like airline and food safety inspections will be impacted. It's time to #EndtheShutdown. https://t.co/nlmqz2y9qK As a scientist, I look for facts when I make policy decisions. I didn’t see or hear any tonight to justify this wasteful idea. #TrumpAddress 97% of Americans support passing commonsense background check laws – and yet these bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. Thankful to see the introduction of #HR8 today. #NeverAgain https://t.co/Gvm1CtsPpJ I will donate my congressional pay to @ILfoodbank during this reckless and unnecessary #TrumpShutdown that is hurting hardworking families across the country. https://t.co/LolSgHpgT3 As the #116thCongress gets underway, here’s a look back at some highlights of the work my offices in DC and Illinois accomplished for the people of #IL11 over the past two years. https://t.co/2bjZtbwWG1 The #TrumpShutdown has gone on far too long. @HouseDemocrats passed legislation last night to reopen the government. Now it’s time for @realDonaldTrump to do his job and end this #shutdown. https://t.co/iNiEmRsczz I am excited to get to work in the #116thCongress. The American people deserve a Congress that puts their priorities ahead of special interests, invests in scientific research and embraces facts, and takes its oversight responsibility seriously. https://t.co/wgTZUy1n91 I was proud to vote for @NancyPelosi for Speaker of the House. It’s time for the new Congress to get back to fact-based policy to help all Americans. #116thCongress https://t.co/lihMtOFMOH ICYMI: the #TrumpShutdown could adversely affect scientific research. Innovation &amp; discovery require sustained federal funding. When @realDonaldTrump fails to lead, we risk losing new medical treatments &amp; new technology that could fight #climatechange.
https://t.co/TmUPhCTKgL I am deeply saddened to learn that Mayor Tom Weisner passed away. Mayor Weisner led Aurora through a period of great change and growth, leaving it a more vibrant place to live, work, and play. My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/UsgRMbIPFg Happy #Kwanzaa to all in Illinois and around the world who are celebrating. Best of luck to Santa tonight as he and his reindeer defy the physics of the space-time continuum. Thank you to everyone at @NoradSanta for the updates! #MerryChristmas to all who are celebrating! I introduced a bill to close the Congressional gym during a government shutdown. @SpeakerRyan continues to use it during the #TrumpShutdown as federal workers face uncertainty over the holidays. The only task we have right now is ending the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/kB5k7SFCeD The #TrumpShutdown is unnecessary. I am ready to support an agreement that funds the government and does not waste resources on a border wall. https://t.co/eIWbUEmtVY RT @FSCDems: #RELEASE: Committee #Democrats Stand Up for #DACA Recipients Seeking Access to #Homeownership

READ: https://t.co/x8rwcjSiU4 h… I am proud to announce that @UofStFrancis will receive a major @NSF grant to support local students pursuing #STEM degrees. https://t.co/qISfLWxIrf I opposed this bill because any funding for a border wall is a waste of resources that are better spent on other priorities like education and infrastructure. Tonight, we saw @HouseGOP bring us closer to an unnecessary shutdown. https://t.co/R0qnSqVwHi I’m proud to support the #FirstStepAct to begin reforming our criminal justice system. https://t.co/tTf7vvOX2U Any funding for a border wall is a colossal waste of resources. That’s money we could use to fund new infrastructure projects and new schools. We all agree we need to fix our broken immigration system but threatening to shut down the government isn’t the way to get things done. https://t.co/1ydrbp0tsr Millions of Americans have access to life-saving health insurance thanks to the #ACA. Republicans should stop their attacks on health care and work to make it stronger. https://t.co/GYWMZE209F Tomorrow is the deadline to sign up for health insurance through the https://t.co/2XcBP2HcO2  marketplace. Don't miss your chance to #GetCovered! Six years ago today, 20 children and 6 adults were shot and killed at #SandyHook. The best way to honor the victims of senseless gun violence is to take action and pass reforms that will make our communities safer. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. This week, I introduced common-sense legislation to allow patients to access their medical records for free up to once a year, removing an unreasonable financial barrier to health care. https://t.co/iXYqpcxdqt I am proud to join with my colleagues @RepChuck, @repbenraylujan, and @RepLeeZeldin to support the vital work of the men and women at our nation’s national labs. https://t.co/g2DTydQ0h3 Today, I announce my support for @NancyPelosi as Speaker of the House for the 116th Congress. She has signaled her commitment to transfer her knowledge to the next generation of leaders so that they may effectively lead the Party into a new era. https://t.co/WJ8e3WWRon We know #climatechange is real and largely man made. The #ParisAgreement was a landmark agreement to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming. We must commit to protect our planet for future generations. Open Enrollment is only 5 more days – until December 15. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered on https://t.co/2XcBP2HcO2 for 2019! https://t.co/O0wfbsDSR1 Today, we pause to remember the sacrifice and bravery of the men and women who defended our country at Pearl Harbor. #PearlHarborDay https://t.co/KA3kPZseOs Thank you to everyone who attended our discussion on mental health and the impact of social media last night in #Naperville. https://t.co/KNG0ynFbEj From Abraham Lincoln to Jane Addams, Enrico Fermi to @BarackObama, the impact of Illinoisans on the great story of America is undeniable. I am proud to join in celebrating 200 years of our history as a state. #illinois200 https://t.co/kCCYaqxQdm I was honored to join students competing in @ENERGY’s annual Cyber Defense Competition this weekend at @argonne. The event brings together teams from across the country and is a great example of how we can inspire the next generation of #STEM leaders. https://t.co/lUxOUqltye Wishing a #HappyHanukkah full of family and happiness to everyone celebrating the Festival of Lights. Our thoughts are with the Bush family as we mourn the passing of George H.W. Bush. President Bush gave decades of service to our nation - from Naval pilot to Commander-in-Chief. America is a better country because of his service &amp; leadership. #Bush41 Whether @realdonaldtrump wants to believe the #NCA4 or not, #ClimateChange is real, it’s largely man made, and failing to #ActOnClimate endangers the prosperity of future generations of Americans. Today, I introduced legislation with @SenDuckworth, @SenatorDurbin, @RepLipinski, and @RepSchneider to help @EPA communicate effectively and efficiently about the public health risks of chemicals like ethylene oxide. https://t.co/sFuC5VtA71 A new report by @CDCgov is a sobering look at how drug overdoses and suicides are negatively impacting U.S. life expectancy. We have a lot of work to do if we are going to reverse these trends and prevent unnecessary deaths. #opioidepidemic https://t.co/yDfXaphSsS Tune in now to see the #MarsLanding! https://t.co/MVKTSOwLug We have known that climate change is real and largely man made. If @realDonaldTrump fails to act, he abdicates his responsibility to ensure prosperity for future generations. It’s time to listen to scientists, Mr. President. https://t.co/kgxu0gHJfC Talk to a scientist https://t.co/VWLR2SBFYz RT @HouseDemocrats: Open Enrollment only lasts six weeks – November 1 to December 15. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered on https://t.co… Helpful bacteria, lactic acid, hydrogen atoms, and osmosis – also known as a scientist’s recipe for making pickles delicious. #NationalPickleDay https://t.co/fkpWF53vTP It was an honor spending time with Vietnam #veterans this weekend in Naperville. We owe so much to those who’ve served and sacrificed for our freedom. https://t.co/YpfkS1N56J On #VeteransDay, we show gratitude to our veterans for everything they have sacrificed in defense of our freedom. https://t.co/v56sZNlzwu As our economy becomes increasingly STEM-based, it has never been more important to increase opportunities for #STEM education and training. #NationalSTEMDay https://t.co/vdSt8HOqXO The #IranNuclearDeal was a success. Because of this deal, Iran removed much of its nuclear material and rendered the core of its heavy water nuclear reactor inoperable.
@realDonaldTrump’s decision shows his diplomatic incompetence. You don’t need a PhD in physics to see that. https://t.co/n8NACAKKPa Open enrollment in https://t.co/2XcBP2HcO2 starts today!  Make sure you #GetCovered. https://t.co/O0wfbsDSR1 Open enrollment for the https://t.co/2XcBP2HcO2 marketplace starts tomorrow! From November 1 through December 15 you can compare health insurance options for 2019 and choose the plan that’s right for you. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered. This announcement is another example of the President's attempt to walk away from the principles that made this country great and to instill fear in the immigrant community and the individuals who lawfully seek asylum in our country. https://t.co/MAefrYhVXs Tonight, we are thinking of the victims and their family and friends. We grieve with them and hope that this country can find a path to healing. https://t.co/MfuE08eRls We should ask for more than thoughts &amp; prayers. We ought to ask for leaders who don’t use racist rhetoric and who condemn any act of violence against people for who they worship, what they look like, or who they love. Can the American people have that leader @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/Mo4qmGiWO9 Tomorrow is #TakeBackDay! Follow the link below for more information on where you can drop off unused medications. 💊🚨 https://t.co/xvRFF8Dpyp This decision would be antithetical to American values. For centuries, the United States has stood as a beacon of hope for all those who seek safety from oppression and a better life for themselves and their children. History will not look kindly on this decision. https://t.co/BFxyL9epYx We refuse to allow these attempted attacks on public officials and journalists to instill fear among us and stoke political divides. We are grateful to the first-responders who put their lives at risk to keep us safe. .⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩: do not use the word “science” to justify your Administration’s bigotry. Everyone deserves respect regardless of who they love or what gender they identify as. If you want policies based on science, try action on #climatechange. https://t.co/OzHbHNp6JK This type of dangerous rhetoric has become the norm for @realDonaldTrump, but it’s important to take a stand against it. Promoting violence against journalists is malicious and stands against American values. https://t.co/xf4C9xxbfn I’ve joined over 150 of my colleagues in demanding @BetsyDeVosED provide answers about why @usedgov has failed to implement the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program that Congress authorized. Our public servants deserve better. https://t.co/hln96UEZRq I am honored to receive a 100 on @HRC’s Congressional Scorecard for my support of #LGBTQ equality. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love. #HRCScorecard https://t.co/dGBXVjJAvu https://t.co/Hl8jd5NJWf Yesterday, I joined @advocatehealth as they announced a new initiative to provide free naloxone kits to patients treated for opioid addiction or overdose. This is a proactive way to confront the #opioidepidemic, and it will save lives. https://t.co/SpytRJLVwD ICYMI: @realDonaldTrump claimed on @60Minutes that scientists have a political agenda. It was an unfortunate example of his inability to understand the importance of science and how scientific research can make our world a better place.
https://t.co/vU52ys5mm1 I had a great visit to a local Will County farm today and learned more about the machinery farmers use to do their work. #NationalFarmersDay https://t.co/IYkUkvVd8t It’s #HispanicHeritageMonth! #Latinos have a significant, positive impact on our culture &amp; economy in Illinois and our nation. Read more about their contributions here: https://t.co/1Pjubj6F9C I’ve called on @GovRauner to address the damage the Republican tax plan will have on #Illinois taxpayers. https://t.co/88lWIiqXcQ Thank you to everyone who attended our #STEM fair at @JolietJrCollege on Saturday – including a slithery friend from @brookfield_zoo! https://t.co/ObS2r3nWiB More evidence that it’s past time to take science and climate change seriously. If we don’t take action soon, our planet and the well-being of vulnerable populations will be at risk. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to get #backtoscience. https://t.co/osTrRefK1e Leon Lederman was a brilliant physicist whose love of scientific discovery was inspirational to so many and whose work transformed our understanding of the world around us. https://t.co/sYZDDtydVx Proud that @usedgov has named Naperville North HS a @NatlBlueRibbon school! This is a testament to the hard work of teachers, administrators, students, and parents who make education a priority in @Naperville203 &amp; our community. #nbrs2018 https://t.co/JpgDQrflIN The United States has stood as a leader for human rights, because our policies have reflected openness and acceptance. This decision turns back the clock on progress and is a disgrace. The global #LGBTQ community deserves nothing short of equality. https://t.co/oY2m8uvEp9 Congrats to Arthur Ashkin, Gerard Mourou, and especially to Donna Strickland for winning the Nobel Prize in physics.  We need to do more to encourage and celebrate #WomeninSTEM so that it’s not 55 years until the next woman wins a #NobelPrize. https://t.co/utvtnWJvJ1 Join us this Saturday at @JolietJrCollege for an interactive #STEM fair featuring local organizations including @brookfield_zoo! https://t.co/nQHbw44yJk Happy Birthday! For sixty years, @NASA has inspired explorers, young scientists, and our imaginations to understand the world beyond our own planet. #NASA60th https://t.co/RmMxZTZQrC ICYMI: Important news out last week regarding @realDonaldTrump’s accountability to our country as President. No one is above the rule of law. https://t.co/eV6fIvdm7o I opposed this plan because it will add trillions to our national debt and endangers Medicare and Social Security. It also hurts hardworking families in Illinois. I am ready to work on a fair tax plan, but this plan is just another gift to the wealthy and corporations. #TaxScam2 https://t.co/XXtoLExub1 Finally, we also need a plan to detect and monitor non-stack emissions of ethylene oxide to ensure safe levels in #Willowbrook and the surrounding areas. We will continue to update everyone as we receive more information. Then, the community needs an explanation of what these results mean in terms of the long-term health impact for nearby residents. A brief update on testing at the Sterigenics facility in #Willowbrook: While the initial stack test indications may be encouraging, we need quantitative results that verify the 90% reduction of emissions estimated by Sterigenics. On a difficult day for many to see and hear, we are reminded that creating an environment where women can come forward without fear is an important step. Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who represents nothing less than the highest moral and ethical standards. https://t.co/g0pILwsKEg I had the honor of speaking at the @letscispeak premiere last week. It underscores the important work that scientists do and why we need them and their research now more than ever. #letsciencespeak https://t.co/lgv8jmhKPE I’ve joined @SenatorDurbin and @SenDuckworth to ask @EPA and Sterigenics to immediately conduct testing air quality in Willowbrook to detect emissions of ethylene oxide and make the data public. https://t.co/Kf6wWFCPfD Proud to join @SteveKnight25 in announcing our bipartisan legislation – the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act – was signed into law last week. https://t.co/5QBmN49Z9K Join us on Saturday in #Naperville for a discussion on the link between mental health disorders and substance use, as well as how effective mental health treatment can help prevent people from turning to drugs or alcohol. https://t.co/a8tP94Hw5C Great news! https://t.co/NTJNS4fXWh .@realDonaldTrump have you no shame? Your immigration policies - your Muslim Ban, your reduction of the number of refugees allowed in the United States, and your family separations - are nothing more than a degradation of our country’s values. https://t.co/VB7OIXbqeV My district offices in Aurora and Joliet are seeking interns for the fall and winter terms. https://t.co/5DeMem9HiD I am proud to see @northcentralcol has joined the #YouAreWelcomeHere scholarship program. Its commitment to international students makes our community stronger. We all thrive when we welcome diversity. https://t.co/lDlSDldJiR G’mar Chatima Tova to all observing Yom Kippur tonight and tomorrow in Illinois and around the world. I stand with my colleagues in Congress - the Senate should postpone the #Kavanaugh vote until there is a thorough investigation into the sexual assault allegations. https://t.co/jOAWOwV6td As technology becomes more important in our lives, lawmakers need the Office of Technology Assessment to make the best decisions for all Americans. It’s time to bring back the OTA so we can prepare for future challenges. https://t.co/33En2LxPlw #DoddFrank made our nation’s economy stronger and gave Americans confidence in a system that is safer, more accountable, and more transparent. Democrats remain committed to fighting to protect American consumers and ensure our economy works for everyone. #10yearsafter https://t.co/RobHStpzAU As a scientist, I can tell you it’s impossible to make facts disappear simply by outright denial. It’s past time for you to show leadership to our country and - perhaps - a little bit of human decency for your fellow Americans. https://t.co/Fmj67XJSHE .@realDonaldTrump’s assault on the environment continues. Gutting @EPA’s methane rules will make it easier for oil and gas companies to pollute the air we breathe. https://t.co/xM3lNiwyCF Tune in now to hear more about what policymakers can do to advance #Alzheimers research. #AtlanticStateofCare https://t.co/klp1vUiBH5 It’s been 17 years since that fateful day that changed our nation  forever. It is vital that we #neverforget the lives we lost on  #September11th – or the bravery and sacrifice of first responders who  ran into harm’s way to help the victims. https://t.co/Js4vQ5MixR Thank you to everyone who joined us in #Naperville on Saturday to learn about pursuing a nomination to one of America's service academies. https://t.co/7sPi2rYqhE Shana tova to everyone celebrating tonight! https://t.co/ysQ9wcKcON This is despicable. Subjecting families seeking lawful asylum to separation and detention for long periods of time is inhumane. We are a stronger country when we respect the basic human rights and dignity of every person. #JusticeForAll https://t.co/fAjf5WZYTf Today, Republicans are in court to strike down protections for people with pre-existing conditions. I stand with my colleagues today to fight against any attempt to destroy protections the ACA guarantees. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/IUr5p1Fz2l Federal employees perform vital work for our country’s national security; they respond to natural disasters; and, they conduct important research to make sure our country remains a leader in technology and science.

Thank you, Senator, for showing us how to lead with honor and integrity to the very end. https://t.co/4SgGALba32 We all agree a nuclear North Korea is a threat to our national security. @realDonaldTrump needs to listen to diplomats and scientists who have the technical qualifications to advise him on the deeply complicated denuclearization process. https://t.co/2STcKa9jcm Wishing everyone who celebrates a joyous Eid! #EidMubarak Once again, @realDonaldTrump has placed special interests ahead of the health and safety of our children and the future of our planet. Ending the Clean Power Plan will have serious public health consequences. https://t.co/s7W6EtjUTq Let’s be honest. This idea was always terrible and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Our men and women in uniform work already hard to protect our country. Let’s use our resources wisely &amp; commit our military to real threats to our national security - not ridiculous displays of power. https://t.co/4u3N3LnHey Yesterday, I had a chance to tour the @MortonArboretum in Lisle and meet with their great staff. #IL11 https://t.co/U93918yltB On the one year anniversary of #Charlottesville, we continue to fight against racism, bigotry, and hatred.

We cannot turn back the clock on progress. #WhatsAtStake Today, I joined @RepMikeQuigley and @janschakowsky at @UCSUSA to discuss nuclear weapons and the need for @realDonaldTrump to take qualified scientific advice seriously during his negotiations with North Korea. https://t.co/V61PvoAZn2 We will continue to advocate for these young people who deserve to be reunited with their parents as soon as possible. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/qVEqPL9mDa Our country is a nation of immigrants, and we are stronger because of their dedication and commitment to our national security. These men and women deserve our highest respect - this report is despicable. https://t.co/DQ1rj5YFSN .@EPAScottPruitt’s resignation is long overdue. He deliberately reversed years of environmental regulations and climate change research, and he wildly misused taxpayer money for wasteful purchases. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to nominate someone who supports science. https://t.co/Mt1uwlUsHu Happy #IndependenceDay! Check out @NASA for interesting facts about our country’s mission in space.
#IndependenceDay2018 https://t.co/Ge33hiu6rZ On the 54th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we remain as committed as ever to the fight for equality, justice, and freedom for all. https://t.co/AEW0BVeAHN We all agree a nuclear North Korea is a threat to our national security. That’s why @realDonaldTrump should take the time and listen to qualified scientific advisors who understand the challenges of this process. North Korea cannot and will not denuclearize after one meeting. https://t.co/HH8g6zryG2 A free press is the foundation of our country’s democracy - this means freedom to express ideas without persecution or harm. We honor the memory of the individuals we lost today with a recommitment to the freedom of all people to go to work or school without fear of violence. https://t.co/eMUMcsFG6n I am proud to announce that @UofStFrancis will receive over $950,000 from the @NSF to provide scholarships for undergraduate #STEM majors who are pursuing teaching careers. #IL11 https://t.co/H4J5LeHKLi Simply put, House Republican leaders wasted our time with a failed #immigration bill that provided no real solutions to the immigration crisis. https://t.co/XgO7xsd9nV I am deeply concerned that the Supreme Court’s #Janus decision will weaken our strong labor unions that have given our workers a safer work environment, fair wages, and collective bargaining rights against unfair working conditions. https://t.co/WtuZBBJQ5c Today is the third anniversary of the #SCOTUS decision that legalized marriage equality, but we need to do more. The Equality Act will extend equal protections to #LGBTQ community. It’s time to end the discrimination that is still legal in 30 states. #EqualityForward #LoveWins Women deserve affordable and accessible health care. This includes access to facts that are clear and answers to their questions without bias. #EndTheLies https://t.co/4hC9GVfWHQ It’s a sad day for our country when our legal system condones bigotry and xenophobia. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for their actions. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/PqjfmRD1Qs .@realDonaldTrump’s cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reunification. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/71MMWBMMj1 Voting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE. https://t.co/27dp86MeEc All of the great images from #CephalopodWeek are a reminder of the diverse creatures that live in the oceans and the need to protect them for future generations. (Maybe every week should be #CephalopodWeek) https://t.co/brTFuSTCgs I voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act because it expands medication-assisted treatment for individuals who struggle with opioid dependency. https://t.co/u7oNaJOf8S RT @RepJerryNadler: Well said @NYMag https://t.co/cqfkQ5M5I2 I voted against this legislation because it did not #ProtectDREAMers or offer them a pathway to citizenship. It would also expand family separation, making an already condemnable situation even worse. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/VLxVh3E76K RT @SenatorDurbin: Good news for main street businesses in IL &amp; across US: #SCOTUS has cleared the way for our retailers to compete on a le… Join me on Monday in Aurora for an important discussion I’m hosting on the risk of cyberattacks. #cybersecurity https://t.co/sHnlXTvH2L Yesterday, I called on the @NSF to implement reforms for a better work environment for all scientists and researchers. https://t.co/09KdnSr63O I’m proud to stand with @NancyPelosi, @RepJerryNadler, @RepGutierrez, and all @HouseDemocrats to call on @realDonaldTrump to #KeepFamiliesTogether. There’s absolutely no reason to inflict lasting harm on families who seek a better life for themselves and a better future. https://t.co/QdYrfYCEI2 This announcement is great news for our economy and innovation. We need a robust and fair patent system to foster the ideas of tomorrow. https://t.co/JowYon1tHp There’s no question that #FamiliesBelongTogether. That’s why I co-sponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct with my colleagues in the House. We must stop @realDonaldTrump from taking children away from their parents. https://t.co/7scFBpJsD2 RT @ASH_hematology: 300,000 babies will be born with #sicklecell disease this year. Join our webinar tomorrow, #WorldSickleCellDay, to lear… I’m proud to stand with @RepJerryNadler and support his legislation to protect families from this insidious policy.  #FamilesBelongTogether #StopSeparatingFamilies https://t.co/UqoDaZFZng 35 years ago today, #SallyRide made history by becoming the first American woman in space. Dr. Ride was a pioneer who paved the way for more women to pursue careers in #STEM fields. https://t.co/o7wavdbbfT I’ve called on @ICEgov to provide detailed answers concerning its so-called “Operation Keep Safe” in the Chicagoland area last month. I strongly condemn any attempt to instill fear in our immigrant community. https://t.co/H6nbaZaBOQ Let’s be clear: there is only one person who shoulders the blame for this despicable policy. I continue to condemn the separation of children from their parents. We must stand up together for common decency and morality. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pMCXa4sNds RT @HouseDemocrats: #Eidmubarak to all those celebrating in the U.S. and around the world! https://t.co/5yZ8qMzBw9 The situation at the border remains disturbingly immoral and against everything our country represents. @realDonaldTrump has made it U.S. policy to separate children from their parents. This is shameful. https://t.co/vqZpo18qq9 I’ll just leave this right here and remind everyone that discrimination has no place in our country. https://t.co/phHwT9cgbI. cc: @USOCC Proud to stand with my colleagues to make sure our workplace is inclusive and supportive of everyone regardless of their sexual or gender identity. https://t.co/WXVxSEniZ8 Great to chat with @RobertPicardo and @exploreplanets yesterday on Capitol Hill! Thanks for stopping by to talk about science! https://t.co/yhswsn4dEy Great to meet with researchers from @IBM today to discuss quantum computing with a real quantum computer! https://t.co/8sOx0PnrPL We all agree a nuclear #NorthKorea threatens our national security. We must look to verifiable criteria to ensure that North Korea is serious about giving up nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, it appears the President walked away with only vague promises. https://t.co/JZU5JCz8Wf No one should live in fear or endure violence because of who they love. Today, we remember the lives we lost too soon and pledge to make our country safe for everyone. #DisarmHate #OrlandoStrong #LoveisLove https://t.co/WYbi6p0tbb The United States has always been a beacon of hope for people who seek refuge from oppression and fear. History does not look kindly on us when we fail to live up to our country’s founding principles. https://t.co/Pc5SY2Z7OE Today, the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality goes into effect, but the fight for a free and open internet continues. The Senate has already voted to #SaveTheInternet. I’m proud to support similar #NetNeutrality legislation in the House. https://t.co/w3DfG8NP6m
