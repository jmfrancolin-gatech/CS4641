We can, however, discuss smart, effective border security - improving ports of entry, additional drug detection equipment, for example. https://t.co/aTybPyUg6j Lowey: It's essential that we fulfill our responsibility to the American people and reopen the government. Closing the government is childish. We don't need this kind of temper tantrum.

But the wall would not make us more secure. https://t.co/tDUTIPCBgQ Lowey: For the first time in American history, we convened a new Congress with the federal government partially shut down. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/eaL9lAyuDh Lowey: @POTUS needs to come to the table and have a serious discussion. No progress has been made to end the #TrumpShutdown, because he refuses to negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/zh6bWkQ5hW Lowey on @BrianLehrer show: We need to reopen the government then have a serious discussion about border security.
