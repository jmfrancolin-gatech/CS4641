He’s still in the same roll as when he was on the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was just treading water and stonewalling. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/dmZlhzQ9SK If the Trump family owes lots of money to Russian oligarchs &amp; people close to Putin &amp; that effected the actions he took as POTUS, investigating their finances wouldn’t be crossing a red line but would be a red line directly to Moscow that we need to look into. #Whitaker #Mueller https://t.co/9EPMvxzmR2 The #MuellerInvestigation has resulted in the conviction of Paul Manafort; guilty pleas from Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, and Michael Cohen; and dozens of indictments.

Watch live here: https://t.co/dmUV6vorIr The @CFPB and the Trump administration continue to show that they work for predatory pay day lenders, not #ForThePeople. Rolling back regulations on payday loans shows a clear disregard for the needs of poor people and people under financial stress. #ProtectConsumers #Memphis When we hear at the #SOTU that you can’t have peace &amp; legislation if you have war &amp; investigation, that’s deeply concerning. I hope that acting Attorney General #Whitaker will choose to cooperate at Friday’s @HouseJudiciary hearing, but, if not, we have subpoenas ready. #Justice During the Great Depression, when we sat on the brink of financial ruin, Democrats passed the New Deal &amp; saved our country.

If the President is serious about stopping the spread of #HIV/#AIDS by 2030, I think that’s admirable. But he shouldn’t leverage this for political points if he doesn’t plan to follow through.
