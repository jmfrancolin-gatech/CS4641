My full statement: https://t.co/xPlnEXqfPr https://t.co/qb4syq78oT Just in: The administration has released the Missile Defense Review. Check out my full statement: https://t.co/azgfpGsUj4 https://t.co/7BHYuatYSu During this Congress, I‚Äôm looking forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this key priority and continuing our work in providing for a strong national defense. While @US_Stratcom is located in Sarpy County, NE, it is a national asset with a global mission ‚Äì over 180,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and civilians are working every day around the world in support of the command‚Äôs mission. #Service That means any delay or any error, could put at risk our ability to field an effective nuclear deterrent in the future, and we cannot allow that to happen. In the face of growing threats, our deterrent must remain strong. As a result of decisions to delay and defer funding, there is no margin for error in the schedule. The command and control networks that our nuclear forces rely on are also in need of replacement, as is the scientific #infrastructure that maintains our stockpile of aging warheads. As our nuclear deterrent becomes more important to our nation‚Äôs defense, the need for nuclear modernization only grows. This conclusion is echoed by the administration‚Äôs #NuclearPostureReview. Meanwhile, our warheads and delivery systems age toward obsolescence, as does the #infrastructure that maintains our deterrent. With #Russia and #China increasingly seeking to challenge US interests and reshape the geopolitical landscape in their favor, the unique role our nuclear forces play in deterring conflict &amp; preventing war is becoming increasingly important. As part of the effort to ensure our military is prepared for new threats, we must continue modernizing our #nuclearforces. I‚Äôm entering my 7th year on the Senate Armed Services Committee where we‚Äôve continued the committee‚Äôs long-standing, bipartisan tradition of working to strengthen our #military.

It is an honor to tell his story. #NEhero Matt was a consistent source of inspiration for his fellow Marines, he was the kind of young man that people were just drawn to. He was tough yet a selfless Marine. #SemperFi For his ultimate sacrifice, Corporal Matt Henderson received the naval achievement medal with cluster, a Purple Heart, and he was the first to receive the prestigious Non-Commissioned Officer Combat Engineer of the Year award posthumously. Matt warned his squad to get back and take cover but was unable to get out of range himself. The remainder of his squad survived. #Leadership #Service #Sacrifice As a squad leader, Matt was aware of and concerned about the dangers of his second deployment. On May 26, 2004, Matt was leading his squad in sweeping an area in the Al Anbar province of Iraq. During the sweep, Matt and two of his men were killed when an IED was detonated #NEhero In February of 2004, Matt deployed to Iraq for the second time and Jaimie moved back to #Nebraska to be closer to their families. Upon Matt‚Äôs return home in May of 2003, he and Jaimie finally had their big church wedding in Lincoln, NE. They moved to California where Matt was stationed. During his deployment, Matt was chosen to be a squad leader due to his #leadership abilities &amp; the respect of the other Marines. Matt‚Äôs family had no communication with him during this time and watched the news every evening with the hopes of catching a glimpse of Matt. In February of 2003, Matt deployed to Iraq where he joined other U.S. led forces in the invasion of Iraq from Kuwait in order to oust Saddam Hussein. #NEhero On August 4, 2001, Matt proposed to his girlfriend Jaimie on Mission Beach in San Diego just after sunset. As they planned their wedding in Nebraska, Matt‚Äôs unit was informed they would be among the first forces to invade Iraq. Due to his strong interest in the construction field, Matt also finished Combat Engineer School at Camp Lejeune, and he was assigned to the 1st Combat Engineers Battalion at Camp Pendleton. In 2000, Matt joined the @USMC because he was attracted to the discipline &amp; direction it offered. He completed boot camp at @MCRD_SD before attending &amp; completing infantry training at @MCIWPendletonCA. #Service Matt loved sports and was a devout @Huskers and @ChicagoBears fan. #GBR #Tradition After Matt‚Äôs father finished veterinary school, he moved the family to the Good Life. As Matt grew up, he made many friends and could be found by his dad‚Äôs side on equine veterinary visits.
