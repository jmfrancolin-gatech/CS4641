Today my thoughts and prayers are with my colleague @RepDebDingell after the passing of her husband. Congressman John Dingell was a beloved legislator who served the people of Michigan in Congress for nearly six decades. He will be missed. We must keep working to make sure every American can afford their medicines. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act, which would put patients first and allow Medicare to negotiate fair drug prices for our seniors. #ForThePeople https://t.co/HSntUDRu2E After tonight's #SOTU, it’s time for @realDonaldTrump to add substance to his words of bipartisanship and unity by working with Democrats to rebuild our nation’s transportation infrastructure and bring down the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. I invited Allen Fritz, an air traffic controller from Pennsylvania and a member of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (@NATCA), as my guest for tonight's #SOTU. He was one of thousands of selfless Americans who worked without pay during the government shutdown. https://t.co/VlzARFKdgn We celebrate the courage of so many who helped shape the beliefs and values of all people. “I knew someone had to take the first step, and I made up my mind not to move.” - #RosaParks #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/yL6wdk6Wxa Mitch McConnell doesn’t want:
- big money out of politics
- to protect our national sovereignty
- you to vote https://t.co/SyHQ8pSeRH I'm proud to introduce legislation to Make Voting Accessible for All American Workers. The "Time Off To Vote Act" would require employers to grant their employees at least two hours of paid leave to vote in federal elections. https://t.co/E2PGpMo130 RT @govtrack: .@RepCartwright got bipartisan cosponsors on the most bills compared to 
all House Democrats last Congress. 
https://t.co/9Cc… S&amp;P also estimated our economy lost $24 BN from Ted Cruz’s 2013 shutdown. That means tens of thousands of lost jobs every time. Shutdowns should be off limits. https://t.co/wZHmrPKpju I’ll be stopping in at St Luke’s tomorrow to help out with this. Come on, already. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/UkIbJMqeU2 The House has passed 10 bills to reopen government and allow hardworking federal employees get back to work and get paid in full, but Mitch McConnell has refused to take up the bipartisan legislation. Shutting down the government is not an effective governing tool.#EndTheShutdown How the Shutdown Affects Federal Employment in Each State https://t.co/Eq6yjXHjVC I’m a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 1, the House Democrats’ bill to reform our political system.  It would increase voter participation in elections, stop outsider influence on elections with big money, and raise ethical standards in every branch of the federal government. https://t.co/sPqVyguYu5 Today, we honor those who lost their lives 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor, and we recognize all veterans for their heroic commitment and service to our country. https://t.co/u8riyIW2NI Open enrollment on https://t.co/sfJUfh522i ends in less than two weeks.

Honored to receive a 100 on @HRC’s Congressional Scorecard for my support of LGBTQ equality. #HRCScorecard https://t.co/brGnWgblJ6 https://t.co/HQTlybEif6 We all saw this coming when Republicans rammed through a huge tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Now they target your Medicare and Social Security benefits as the way to pay for their ill-advised tax cuts for the rich.
https://t.co/pBy1IUBXcn Rising costs in housing, specialty medical treatment and hospital services, and prescription medicines.

I support adjusting the way Social Security COLAs are figured to better reflect rising prices in the areas of need and expense for seniors. #ExpandSocialSecurity. Today’s Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement of 2.8% is welcome news to seniors who have seen their living and out-of-pocket medical expenses rise. But we need Social Security benefits to keep up with all the rising costs that hit seniors hard. America's most successful conservation program could expire within days. Reauthorizing #LWCF is a no brainer - it costs the American taxpayer nothing, protects our treasured #publiclands, and helps preserve American history. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/ugsqbJzf6n The FY18 Assistance to Firefighters Grant application period opens soon. You can begin preparing now. I advocate for programs like AFG to ensure first responders in cash-strapped communities get help to keep people, property &amp; themselves safe. @AppropsDems
https://t.co/6ZORFWNPZP I'm happy to join the new #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus. #SocialSecurity is an earned benefit, a vital program to our nation, that we need to protect, strengthen and expand. https://t.co/axJjMxZBrw 17 years later. Time marches on, but we must #NeverForget those who were lost and the sacrifices made that day. https://t.co/TNurtUJx7E Our economy is dependent on the hard work, dedication, and expertise of federal civilian workers.  They deserve the same rights and respect that private sector employees deserve. Instead of freezing, we should be raising wages to invest in local families and our region’s growth. @NTEUnews Congrats on the striking down of a wrongheaded executive order. #publicservicedeservespublicrespect Senator John McCain served his country in Vietnam with uncommon bravery and on Capitol Hill with uncommon conviction.  His patriotism was unmatched, and he will be missed widely. For 83 years now, Social Security has provided older Americans with stability and security. Without it, 2 in 5 older Americans would be living in poverty. We must protect it from partisan attacks.  #SocSec83 Union memberships have been declining for decades as labor remains under attack. The recent #SCOTUS decision in #Janus is the latest blow to organized labor. At the same time, wages have fallen &amp; economic inequality has risen. 

Coincidence? You decide:
https://t.co/gzcBoYGO9m When you propose good legislation that will save lives &amp; money, like my #OrganDonor Clarification Act will, support comes in from all over. Here’s Republican former Speaker @newtgingrich with a strong endorsement of my bill: https://t.co/b22lQqmYOw Today’s deadline imposed by #China on US air carriers is an unnecessary provocation. The gov’t and people of #Taiwan should know that we stand with them as friends.  https://t.co/9ZUXmq0e2M The #AderholtAmendment is a thinly veiled #LicenseToDicriminate. The amendment would allow child welfare organizations to discriminate against #LGBT people, denying loving homes for children who need them most. https://t.co/N7qrHC4Tws 115,000 people await an organ transplant in America. My #OrganDonorClarificationAct will save lives and billions in Medicare costs. That’s why I have support from Rs &amp; Ds, orgs &amp; individuals, Nobel winner Al Roth &amp; conservative tax reformer @GroverNorquist https://t.co/bGt2BebP1f Nothing was more important to the development of the middle class than America's labor movement. After this week's #Janus decision undermined workers' rights, it's more important than ever that we give Americans #ABetterDeal. https://t.co/l3WogkDOU1 #SCOTUS decision in #Janus was not jurisprudence, it was bare-knuckle politics. My bill protects collective bargaining rights for employees. Organized labor is a time-honored tradition in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act defends it #Union https://t.co/TdpO4pd8wj The #SCOTUS #Janus decision is an outright attack on unions, an attack on working people &amp; the causes we fight for every day. We stand with our union brothers &amp; sisters. This decision will not stop our efforts.
#UnionProud #UnionStrong https://t.co/lVudB1Lvir Three years ago marriage equality became the law of the land. Today we continue to push for progress and seek to end all remaining discrimination. #EqualityForward https://t.co/e5hZkujGoM We need to increase the supply of organs for transplantation by removing barriers that donors face under current law. This will save lives, and this will save Medicare and the gov't billions of dollars. #organdonation Twenty-two people die every day as they wait for a viable #OrganDonor. Today I was interviewed by a documentary video crew about my Organ Donor Clarification Act. https://t.co/b2499pN9MV This evening I’m joining my fellow @SEEC members to speak out to #SaveLWCF. Every Pennsylvanian deserves the opportunity to experience the beauty of nature in their own backyard. https://t.co/4oufB3vc1G We need to stop this new policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border. @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogether bill that I cosponsor will end this inhumanity. #HumanRights #FamiliesBelongTogether The notion that you must separate children from their parents to secure the border is just not true. This is a cruel way to try and deter illegal border crossings. I support border security, but now we must end the family separations and #KeepFamiliesTogether Enjoy your day, Dads!
#HappyFathersDay https://t.co/YJQSg514t8 I'm thankful for the bipartisan effort with Congressman @RepJasonLewis on our bill to help counter the devastating effects of opioid abuse in the workplace. This will help employers as they search for ways to support affected employees. https://t.co/r4XdgTCYc2 Over 5 million Pennsylvania residents have pre-existing conditions that are protected by the ACA. Their health care is now under attack.

Americans with these pre-existing conditions shouldn’t face discrimination. Period. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/qMCf6KH7ty https://t.co/eb4ABN49CV This is alarming news. New reports now show the @gop tax bill is causing the Medicare trust fund to dry up quicker than anticipated. We must act to preserve &amp; improve now. https://t.co/EYo5A3Gv6X This #ImmigrantHeritageMonth we celebrate the extraordinary contributions that generations of immigrants have made to enrich our communities, our economy, our culture, and our country. Can you imagine the thoughts these brave men had as they approached shore on #DDay?
