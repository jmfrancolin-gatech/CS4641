Michael Cloud (@RepCloudTX) dropped a great new bill requirin… RT @FindFarmCredit: Our board chairman, Jimmy Dodson, left, met with Rep. Michael Cloud and his wife, Rosel, at Texas Agriculture's Welcome… RT @SharonLWood: Terrific day in our nation’s capital with my fellow engineering deans at Texas universities! And big thanks to @RepBillFlo… During #SOTU, I appreciated the discussion of how we came together during WWII - there’s more that unites than divides us. Congress must put aside party politics, recognize that ending the humanitarian crisis on our border should not be a partisan issue

https://t.co/c7C7SqRWyf RT @NateOnTheHill: I spoke with @RepCloudTX about the need for border security and his first impressions of Washington as a new congressman… My Washington team and I were honored to be presented with the official U.S. Army seal. I will proudly display this in my office as a small show of support to our nation's oldest military branch. https://t.co/41cAyrKGnj RT @USTermLimits: Thank you @RepCloudTX for cosponsoring HJR20 to term limit Congress.

Please take this survey &amp; let me know your opinion on several important issues expected to come before Congress:

https://t.co/UOg324eLY5 Was on House Floor to discuss humanitarian crisis at border. Cartels abuse U.S. generosity &amp; profit from trafficking drugs/humans. Border wall would push back on these crimes, ensuring migrants cross at port of entry protected by law enforcement

Watch: https://t.co/lmxOgir0Xn SURVEY: Last night, the House (with my support) passed a spending bill that included funding for a border wall. As we wait on the Senate to pass or reject the bill, please share your thoughts with me on the construction of a border wall: https://t.co/WVBiyDMtRD https://t.co/yz8qDWmhBr To fix the FEMA process, we need change at the federal level. In the meantime, families and communities need help navigating this complex system.

Check out this guest column in @Vicadvocate for my take on this complicated issue.

After dozens of mtgs with local leaders &amp; residents I was able to discuss our concerns with Mr. Long.

https://t.co/VKNLypu71k Great to see that Pastor Andrew Brunson has been released. Pastor Brunson ran the Resurrection Church in Izmir, Turkey, until he was wrongfully imprisoned and held under house arrest in 2016. It's wonderful to see him go free today. I applaud @POTUS for his efforts to combat human trafficking. This modern slavery affects adults and children of all backgrounds and must come to an end. https://t.co/z0t6zxyQWg Happy #NationalManufacturingDay! American manufacturing is growing at its fastest rate in 23 years! Check out this video celebrating recent job creation and the great work being done in our region.

Happy World Teachers Day to all teachers making a difference in students' lives! https://t.co/2RUWkTzWbL On Gold Star Mothers Day, we remember mothers whose children gave their lives for our nation. I pray for God's peace for these mothers who have sacrificed so much - today and every day. We as a nation are indebted to you. https://t.co/ubE8uMCV5s Yesterday I voted to make this year's tax cuts permanent for middle class families, workers, and small businesses. 

This year we've seen more jobs, bigger paychecks, and historic economic growth - let's keep it that way! https://t.co/QNO4bNueUf A @WSJ op-ed highlights how conservative economic policies are placing more Americans in stable, full-time jobs.

“Over the past year...the number of people working full time increased by more than three million.”

https://t.co/VSUAv9ESED https://t.co/UhETKvgzKJ On #NationalPOWMIARecognitionDay we remember those who have sacrificed so much for our country. #YouAreNotForgotten https://t.co/qO5fNzFJ8o RT @callerdotcom: Corpus Christi Marine receives medals 48 years after earning them https://t.co/uKUnrpvmTz https://t.co/0GLtkNUcSo What an honor to be able to assist Mr. Gonzalez in receiving his long-overdue medals! https://t.co/Y2wycGe942 As a small business owner myself, I can tell you that cutting taxes and burdensome federal regulations leads to job creation and economic growth! https://t.co/aklNih8Y2U Happy Constitution Day!
