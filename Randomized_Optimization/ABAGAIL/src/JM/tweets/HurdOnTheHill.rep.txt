An American retreat only emboldens ISIS.

An American retreat from Afghanistan emboldens Al-Qaeda and undermines the ultimate sacrifice already paid by thousands of Americans. Both will threaten our Homeland again.

This shows the importance of continuing bipartisan, bicameral work to improve our government's ability to defend our digital infrastructure through the #MGTact, #FITARA, empowering a Federal CIO and the SECURE Technology Act (which passed the House and Senate last night). China's objectives are clear: using hacking to steal advanced technology and bolster its position at the expense of other nations. China methodically siphoned out an immeasurable amount of intellectual property, undermining years of research and development and doing irreparable harm to over 40 companies and government agencies like @NASA and the @USNavy. This Chinese state-sponsored cyber attack was pervasive, infiltrating systems in the U.S. and around the globe for over four years. We are in a hot war with China, and cyber space is the battle space. https://t.co/DzQTOKmq6u We have to look at what our allies and enemies think. The fact that Russia, Iran, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad all support this decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria is a problem. We cannot allow ISIS to regroup, train, equip and run operations unencumbered. https://t.co/GS6QZ8qcGI Public libraries, especially in rural areas, do much more than simply offer books. They’re often the main provider of literacy programming, tech training &amp; job seeking assistance in many #TX23 communities. Glad my colleagues came together to support our bipartisan bill today https://t.co/Ii7FTrC91s We cannot abandon our allies, like the Syrian Democratic Forces, and create an opening for ISIS, Iran and Russia to determine the fate of millions of Syrians and create a safe haven for terrorist groups that threaten our security. ISIS is a global threat and could re-emerge as a destructive insurgency in Syria and Iraq. Withdrawing our ground forces undermines the strong, global coalition we built to defeat this threat. It is clear from available intelligence that ISIS is trying to rebuild and still commands a significant fighting force of over 30k. Earlier this month, the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS was undertaking new operations in Eastern Syria. And last week the Chairman of Joint Chiefs said we’ve only trained 20% of the forces necessary to stabilize areas formerly held by ISIS. .@RepKinzinger is right. This decision undercuts the chance of completely defeating ISIS and instead bolsters the Assad regime, which has gassed its own people, killed hundreds of thousands and caused over 6M refugees. https://t.co/TSILWkBkaY We're better than this. This is a symptom of a larger problem we’ve spent years ignoring – our broken immigration system.
