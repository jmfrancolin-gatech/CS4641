That includes #WV. Look no further than the devastating flood we experienced in June 2016 that took 23 lives. .@Sen_JoeManchin: If the US does not lead in developing the technologies that will incentivize China &amp; India to burn coal &amp; natural gas in a cleaner way, it will not matter how much we do here. .@Sen_JoeManchin: Events like the polar vortex will continue to happen &amp; that means energy generation resources &amp; technology must be cost competitive &amp; reliable – 24/7. .@Sen_JoeManchin: While the system performed well, rising natural gas demand made it economical to bring on coal to keep the lights on and homes warm. Coal will continue to be critical in extreme weather situations. .@Sen_JoeManchin: Last week’s brutal cold provided another test case for how our electricity grid is often stressed and changing. .@Sen_JoeManchin: Especially during events like last week’s polar vortex, I know communities around the country are grateful for the energy supply &amp; reliability that #WV provides. .@Sen_JoeManchin: #WV also accounts for 11% of the nation’s coal production &amp; is among the top 3 states w/ the largest amounts of recoverable coal reserves at producing mines. .@Sen_JoeManchin: #WV &amp; its neighbors, also has the historic opportunity to develop an Appalachian Storage Hub. This innovative regional storage and distribution hub would create jobs &amp; reduce greenhouse gas emissions. .@Sen_JoeManchin: In 2016, #WV ranked 5th among states in total energy production according to @EIAgov. And our little state consistently exports more electricity than it consumes. .@Sen_JoeManchin: As ranking member, I look forward to working with @LisaMurkowski to tackle the biggest energy and natural resources questions facing our country.
