There's no question #ChildCare4Vets will save lives, so I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible. BREAKING: Proud to say the House just passed the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, including my amendment ensuring that vets seeking substance abuse counseling never have to choose between getting treatment and taking care of their child. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/u1IhG48X70 Let's get this done, because #ChildCare4Vets will save lives. https://t.co/awuA9HhG49 What’s happened at #MDC is unacceptable. I will continue working with @NydiaVelazquez and @RepJerryNadler to make sure this investigation is thorough and, most importantly, this never happens again. https://t.co/mAWvFlvdiV The opioid epidemic has disproportionately affected our vets, so we need to make it easier, not harder, to receive treatment. I'm proud to have worked with @VetAffairsDems to pass my amendment providing veterans seeking substance abuse treatment access to childcare services. https://t.co/mtX5wrU672 About to speak on the House floor about by amendment to ensure vets seeking substance abuse treatment have access to childcare, so they don't have to choose between treatment or their kids.

I strongly support Medicare negotiating drug prices. This is something that everyone should support. Let's get it done. Proud to be a cosponsor of the strongest bill to date to #EndRxMonopolyPrices https://t.co/mp3Z2evtCS RT @mchooyah: Truth. https://t.co/OQh0g4d0e4 This all could have been avoided if the city had included our community in the process before this decision was made.

They didn't, and now CB 1 has no choice but force the city to listen. I'm proud to stand with them in making sure their voices are heard.
https://t.co/HtRGfTIDlJ Thank you, Michele, for joining me for the State of the Union last night! What a powerful advocate for all those battling the disease of addiction. Can't wait to see you again this summer at your Walk For Hope! https://t.co/3Z2vWGyHMp Tonight’s the easy part, but tomorrow we have to get to work. The President is right, Americans are united around doing something to lower healthcare costs, rebuild our infrastructure, and end the opioid epidemic. Lets do our jobs and get the results Americans expect of us. #SOTU Addiction is a disease that inflicts all races, genders, and classes. We need to be doing all that we can to make sure the opioid epidemic stays on the front burner, not the back burner, so we can tackle this once and for all. https://t.co/X0Ad8p1Qhy I’m honored to have Michele Kunz as my guest to the #SOTU. Michele lost her son, Bobby, in 2015 following a tragic accident during his struggle with addiction to opioids. She was kind enough to share a touching and powerful tribute, “A Message of Hope” 
https://t.co/tgKtJy6Uqz Great convo with @MelissaRusso4NY about tonight's #SOTU. https://t.co/zJvaiXk2ws Heading over to the White House to meet with VA @SecWilkie. When it comes to making sure our veterans are taken care of, I’ll meet with anyone anytime. Happy #LunarNewYear! I was proud to support @RepGraceMeng's resolution recognizing the cultural and historical significance of this day. Wishing a happy and prosperous #YearOfThePig to all those celebrating in #NY11 and across the the country. Important visit this morning with my guy Joe Q to make sure I’m ready for #SOTU https://t.co/U8mW4aGCPJ Proudly #TeamEthan https://t.co/I9QoHkTNXz What happened to Ethan and his family was wrong. I’m happy to see some results finally, but I will not stop holding insurance companies accountable when they screw over families in my district.

https://t.co/kKxLyizIhj The @MTA said they’re buying new buses for the L Train shutdown. If that’s not happening, @HeyNowJO and are I just asking, where are those buses? Send them over to Staten Island!

https://t.co/ZlbORAiUTd RT @JackCookeInNY: Glad to see @RepMaxRose on  @HomelandDems . No district paid a higher price on 9/11 than the #NY11 #NeverForget RT @BklynEagle: “Only in a town as broken as Washington do you still get paid when you don’t do your job,” says @RepMaxRose 
https://t.co/9… On Jackie Robinson's 100th birthday, his lessons in courage and living a life in service of others are as relevant as ever.

"A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." #JR100 Honored for the chance to help defend our nation and secure our homeland from terrorist threats. Nearly 18 years after 9/11, it's about time a member from NYC held this position.

Thank you @HomelandDems for this incredible opportunity. Let's get to work. https://t.co/RWTtxnrJt1 Proud to be working with @RepGolden and @RepDanCrenshaw to bring some common sense to Washington. Keeping the government up and running is the most basic thing that our constituents ask of us. 

We failed and hardworking Americans lost. 

It's time for politicians to have skin in the game. If we can't fund the government, we shouldn't be paid. https://t.co/S1bjyW7d3p I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act.

Ten years after the Lilly Ledbetter Act passed, it's unacceptable that women are still battling the wage gap. It should go without saying that women deserve #EqualPay for equal work, but we've still got a long way to go. Thank you @MASYouthCenter for inviting me to your reception last week. I want you to know that you always have a partner in me and my office. Keep up the great work that you're doing to let the world know that we don't have to choose between our values and our safety. https://t.co/hQmSU9SG4k Only in a town as broken as Washington do you still get paid when you don’t do your job. That’s wrong, and it’s past time to make it right.

Proud to be working with @RepGolden @RepDanCrenshaw to bring some sense to this town. https://t.co/7yxKHpem4h Stopped by @HeyNowJO's BP Assist Live resource fair on Sunday to answer questions from @sewfalcons students. They didn't go easy on us -- but with the challenges they face we can't hide from the tough questions or the tough answers. https://t.co/OdDycFbruj Be on the lookout, because I'll be coming to your neighborhood soon! We promised we’d show up, we’d be different. We’re keeping that promise because it’s what you deserve. That's why we started "Max at your Door," &amp; it's why I spent this weekend knocking on doors from Mariner's Harbor to Oakwood to hear your concerns. https://t.co/bkN2Yojmjd Had the honor of visiting Fort Wadsworth yesterday to thank ⁦@USCG⁩ for continuing to honor their commitment to their country even when their government wasn't returning the favor. https://t.co/UNiXWnVHkK But as @ADL_National reports, we still have a long way to go. Anti-Semitism is on the rise, and domestic extremists killed more people in the US in 2018 than 2017. We must stay vigilant in our efforts to root out hatred in all of its forms. On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, #WeRemember six million Jewish victims &amp; millions of other Nazi targets, we salute WWII veterans who risked their lives to liberate a continent, and we recommit ourselves to educating future generations so that these atrocities never happen again. Thank you Staten Island @NAACP for having me at your #HBCU College Showcase today! https://t.co/0hIiKLUnEX I've been learning a lot in just three weeks on this job. Sadly dancing didn't make the list. ⁦@AOC⁩ got any tips? https://t.co/rbcZZ1ADSD Michael has a long road of recovery ahead of him, but thankfully he and his family are surrounded by such an incredible and generous community @StPetersBoysHS who will be there every step of the way.

Watch out, you might see me at your door soon! https://t.co/OfsKPVckbj Had great meetings with the 60th and 62nd precincts in Brooklyn this week. Proud to be their voice on the @HomelandDems and looking forward to working with them to keep #NY11 safe. https://t.co/9PwSSOwrtD I fully support reopening the government, even on a temporary basis, so the 800,000 hard working Americans can get the pay they deserve and stop being used as political hostages.
https://t.co/8XAT0pD7B2 https://t.co/eCVBUMj2Q5 So tell me again, what was the point of this shutdown, other than show just how absurdly broken Washington is? Hardworking men and women are working every day to serve their country and keep us safe, paying for gas and tolls along the way, without getting their paychecks.

These are not normal times. That's why I'm requesting E-Z Pass delay charging those affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/JWLvviHiyy I am too, Kelly.

It’s time to close the #LobbyistLoophole. https://t.co/uYt6T9Xejl If someone acts like a lobbyist, and is paid like a lobbyist, then they ought to register as a lobbyist.

It’s time we fight back.
 
That's why today I intro'd a bill to close the #LobbyistLoophole that Democrats and Republicans have exploited on behalf of special interests. https://t.co/4kdIHtrKVx Ready to get to work with @RepMarkTakano and @BennieGThompson to fight for the brave men and women who defend our country overseas and here at home on the @HomelandDems @VetAffairsDems. https://t.co/4TwFMoUzg7 The cops, firefighters, and first responders who call #NY11 home are on the front lines defending our country every single day.

Honored to serve on @HomelandDems where I’ll work tirelessly to ensure that these brave men and women get the support and resources they deserve. https://t.co/gPLUstA2KV Today is the 46th anniversary of the landmark Roe v.

https://t.co/VNFfP2OnNi I’m honored by the opportunity to serve on @VetAffairsDems, where I’ll fight to make sure our veterans get the care and benefits they deserve. I accepted the President’s invitation today because I’ll work with anyone to try and end this shutdown as quickly as possible. We must preserve our national security, uphold our values, and reopen the government immediately so we can get to work solving these problems. Couldn't agree more, Jodi. As an Army combat veteran, these servicemembers are my brothers and sisters, and I won't stop fighting to make this right. https://t.co/kGtesK70Ol NY has some of the strongest gun laws in the country, but @NYGovCuomo recognizes that we can always do more to prevent senseless violence.

Happy to see common sense measures like a bump stock ban &amp; red flag laws on his 2019 agenda.

Now it's time for D.C. to do its part. RT @StatenIslandDA: Thanks to @USPS and @RepMaxRose for their teamwork to ensure mailbox fishing becomes a crime of the past.

https://t.co/4m9yGK7lup We’re battling an opioid crisis on Staten Island.

Proud to support the great work being done by Staten Island Borough Commander Chief Kenneth Corey, Deputy Chief Scott Henderson, and all the brave NYPD officers who are on the front lines of this fight. https://t.co/tPhaW4tJ6O And I call on these senators who want to end government shutdowns to come to the table and vote to end this one. Shutting the government down has become an annual tradition in Washington. I absolutely support this plan to stop these once and for all.

https://t.co/3XelE8LtCj I spoke with a constituent who serves in the FBI this morning. It’s a national disgrace that they’re working without pay through the shutdown. We need to do better and end this shutdown. https://t.co/1l2KmKTjBp Getting ready to join @Morning_Joe to talk about how disgusting it is that American workers and their paychecks are being used as political pawns in this government shutdown. https://t.co/oA9kQ9QFpX I spoke with some constituents last night who aren't getting paid because of the shutdown. They're fed up that politicians aren't doing their job, and frustrated that they're being used as hostages. They deserve better from their government. I'll keep fighting for them. https://t.co/4sV6tCIIjq I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure we bring every idea and resource to the table to accomplish that goal—including creating a super express train for South Shore residents as the Borough President has proposed. As I’ve told anyone who will listen and even those who won’t, the ultimate goal for this ferry route must be to shorten the tortuous commute that Staten Islanders on the South Shore endure. Everything we can do to end our commuting nightmare is a step in the right direction, so I commend the Mayor for recognizing the need for fast ferry service on Staten Island. But that’s what this must be: a first step.

https://t.co/jpOyeudRu6 RT @siadvance: Newly-sworn in Rep. Max Rose addressed Congress, re: a bill to construct the East Shore Seawall on S.I. In his speech, Rose… I was honored to stand in solidarity with @ADL_National and my fellow Jewish freshmen against hate. Irrespective of our faith, we all must work together to root our intolerance. https://t.co/PkIeNNWvNA I made a promise when I was sworn in that if something matters to my constituents, well then it matters to me. That's why the first piece of legislation I introduced in Congress is to build the East Shore Seawall off Staten Island. https://t.co/itZYNEBUTL There’s no debate: climate change is real, storms are getting worse, and the East Shore seawall will help protect the lives and livelihoods of Staten Islanders. https://t.co/T3LHku6rsV For too long, Washington D.C. has let the lobbyists and the corporations dictate our healthcare system. That needs to change. So yesterday, I stopped by RUMC to talk to the doctors and nurses on the front lines about what we can do to help. https://t.co/bgXpExyE48 Background checks save lives, plain &amp; simple. In the states that have already passed background check laws:

🔘53% fewer police officers are shot &amp; killed in the line of duty. 
🔘57% fewer women are shot to death by abusive partners. 

It’s time to say #NeverAgain and pass #HR8. Before heading back to DC, I stopped by An-Noor Center last night for a great conversation with Muslim community leaders in #NY11.
