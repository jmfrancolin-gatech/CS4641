Our country has lost a great legislator and public servant. John Dingell was an inspirational fighter for the American people.  My deepest condolences to @RepDebDingell and their entire family. Mr. President, the American people voted for us to clean up Washington. That means investigating wrongdoing and passing laws to end corruption. That is what we intend to do. https://t.co/X6cFDnOykB Our roads, bridges, ports, and even our clean water infrastructure are aging rapidly. We need major investments to keep our economy growing for everyone—and to prepare for the impact of climate change. I was proud to join @TransportDems for a hearing today on #TheCostofInaction Climate change is an extraordinary threat. It is time for an extraordinary response. Our nation can achieve incredible things when we act decisively— but we can’t afford to wait. I am proud to join @RepAOC and @SenMarkey in cosponsoring the Green New Deal Resolution today. Today, that ended. We’re soliciting testimony and holding hearings. It’s time to #ActOnClimate once and for all—and this is only the beginning. 2/2 I’ve served on the Natural Resources committee since 2013. I came to Washington to help lead the fight against climate change, and to confront the defining challenge of our time. For years, GOP majorities blocked our efforts with denialism and junk science. 1/2 The allegations against the Trump inaugural committee are serious, and I am glad to see prosecutors launch a thorough investigation. However, we still need the President’s tax returns, and we need to protect the Special Counsel! https://t.co/uSpDyeOm8n We’ll keep fighting for fair elections, and to stand up to special interests. Our investigators will continue to enforce the law and uncover wrongdoing, whatever the President says. And, we can responsibly secure our border without demonizing immigrants. 3/3 Here in Congress, we can only respond to this darkness with a positive agenda. We’re moving forward with hearings to combat climate change and to tackle gun violence. We will work to provide good healthcare to every American and propose a comprehensive infrastructure plan. 2/3 Last night, we saw a message of fear and divisiveness from President Trump, all wrapped in a thin veneer of civility. He failed to offer any compromise on border security, he threatened a reckless nuclear arms race, and he avoided any mention of the threat of climate change. 1/3 Chúc Mừng Năm Mới to everyone in the 47th district! May you all have a healthy and prosperous year of the Pig! #HappyTet A wall wouldn’t do a single thing to change that fact. Neither will members of our military, who are in support and logistical roles only.  If we want to discuss border security, its time to face reality and stop this posturing. 2/2 This is ridiculous fearmongering. Asylum seekers aren’t hoping to “flood” the border—they want to claim asylum and plead for legal status. They have a legal right under American &amp; International law to have their cases reviewed here. 1/2 https://t.co/ctHXhEl5AU David Bernhardt’s work as an oil industry lobbyist should disqualify him from heading Interior Dept. His nomination by Trump is another blatant attack on our public lands and resources. House oversight will be needed to watch him closely. These reports are deeply alarming. It’s clear that dangerous effects of climate change are already occurring—but there’s time for us to prevent the most serious impacts. We need to #ActOnClimate and we need to act now. https://t.co/zUzfpqd3gk There is simply no “crisis” at the border that would justify an emergency declaration to overrule Congress and the will of the American people. The President must face facts and respect the rule of law. https://t.co/KMbE5vzvpJ 106 years ago today, Rosa Parks was born. Her legacy remains as inspiring as ever. Join me in honoring her by committing to fight for justice for all every day. #BlackHistoryMonth The Administration’s efforts to roll back title IX protections are disastrous for sexual assault survivors. We can’t afford to give up the hard-won and frustratingly slow progress we have made – I  was proud to submit comments to oppose this policy. https://t.co/hTrCMDRDsM Congress is done ignoring the effects of climate change. We’re holding hearings and preparing legislation—and we want to hear how you have been affected directly. Share your stories with us: https://t.co/sK8EZosIbE This week will see the first real congressional hearings on gun violence in years. We allowed this unnecessary crisis to fester for years, as mass shooting after mass shooting added more and more victims. Enough. Action is coming. The Trump EPA is appointing a climate change denier to a key scientific advisory board. Time and again we’ve seen them try to suppress or reshape the undeniable evidence that climate change is a man-made and existential threat. https://t.co/8WnZwF9kQJ The damage done to our national parks by the #TrumpShutdown could take centuries to heal. This is another tragic reminder—we must never allow a shutdown on this scale again. https://t.co/bxmWW7X766 This bullying and politicizing of the intelligence community hearkens back to some of the most disastrous blunders of American foreign policy, including the Iraq War. When a President makes foreign policy based on their preconceived biases, bad things happen. https://t.co/3w5CsBfZ3A The Iran deal made our country safer. Our intelligence chiefs contradicted the President to make that point in testimony this week. We owe our European allies a debt for continuing to uphold the agreement. https://t.co/TGF1tg4eGm Climate change is here. We need to get serious about confronting its impact and limiting further damage. https://t.co/5jsulUzj9T Message to Leader McConnell: making election day a federal holiday  is no “power grab”—it’s an overwhelmingly popular idea to make working people’s voices heard more powerfully. HR 1 is about strengthening our democracy and fighting corruption.  https://t.co/xqTV35oFYg We’re willing to secure our border- investing in scanning equipment at ports of entry and increasing surveillance. But we won’t accept a pointless wall, and we won’t give in to hostage-taking. The President must know that he cannot shut down the government again. We can’t undo the harm that the #TrumpShutdown caused to federal workers, but we can show them that the American people value their service, and help pay what they are worth. I’m that the house passed Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act. The Administration consistently abandons its duty to protect public health, and clean water. This is only the latest example. https://t.co/NgIJ9efrM6 The U.S. should not be supporting Saudi Arabia’s bloody war in Yemen. I will proudly support a War Powers resolution.

RT @LCVoters: Congrats Committee Vice Chair @RepDebHaaland, Insular Affairs VC @Kilili_Sablan &amp; Subcommittee Chairs @RepHuffman, @RepDebHaa… Something is broken. I joined a letter led by @RepBlumenauer and @RepBonamici to urge the Administration to listen to its own experts—and actually read the reports—before its too late! https://t.co/ZNLlVP4FuH 2/2 EPA scientists produced a disturbing warning of the risks posed by climate change, yet EPA director Wheeler told the Senate that he hadn’t read the full report of these findings. Meanwhile, President Trump can’t tell the difference between weather and climate. 1/2 RT @eqca: Congratulations to @RepMaxineWaters, @RepBarragan, @RepLouCorrea and @RepLowenthal for receiving a 100% on our 2018 legislative s… RT @alaskawild: A hearty congrats to returning #Arctic champs @RepHuffman &amp; @RepLowenthal on your subcommittee chairmanships in @NRDems! Lo… I’m honored to have been formally elected  by my @NRDems colleagues to Chair the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. From this platform, I will proudly work to protect our climate, and hold the Administration accountable. Let’s get to work. The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $3 billion, permanently. It was a terrible mistake which must never be repeated. Our federal workers must never be used as political pawns again. https://t.co/U5YGofgoOX This weekend I was honored to host my annual Young Women’s Empowerment Conference in Long Beach! I couldn’t be prouder to join an incredible group of young people, and to help them build leadership &amp; career skills.  https://t.co/MkA3bHQBga 50 Years ago today, our communities were devastated by the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. Its an important reminder of the progress that we have made to protect our oceans, but also of the risks we still face. I’m working every day to #ProtectOurCoasts https://t.co/MZlG8RWTHm There is more to learn, and it is essential that we see the full results of the Special Counsel’s investigation. However, as yet another member of the President’s inner circle is jailed, it is clear that the President must answer for these very serious allegations 2/2 The Roger Stone indictment shows clear evidence that he was in close communication with Wikileaks, an officially designated intelligence service, with the knowledge of the Trump campaign, as they sought to damage Hillary Clinton.  1/2 We know climate change will lead to increasing natural disasters, droughts and economic harm in the US—but is also means conflict, suffering and instability around the world. Climate action is a moral imperative—and a national security issue. https://t.co/EmnxmtJx4i Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Join me in commemorating the suffering of millions of Jews and other innocent victims of Nazism. #WeRemember The #TrumpShutdown was pointless and avoidable. The President chose to hold our country hostage to demand a wall that has been rejected by the American people, and that he claimed Mexico would pay for. The White House security clearance process has been disastrously abused. We need to understand the full magnitude of the problem and whether our national security has been threatened. There must be consequences. https://t.co/e5aZj7j1Mc The Administration has continued its shameful efforts to deport Vietnam War era refugees from South East Asia. We’re working to end this shameful policy. #RefugeeResilience #KeepFamiliesTogether My response to the end of the #TrumpShutdown : https://t.co/gFOwfXYFiA Secretary Ross doesn’t understand the real world. The #Trumpshutdown has forced 800,000 to go without pay for over a month— and the Administration can’t comprehend the harm they’re causing to hardworking Americans. https://t.co/1shoNh1vwi My democratic colleagues and I have voted 11 times to end the shutdown. We have passed 10 bills. We can’t allow the President and Majority Leader McConnell to continue governing by hostage-taking— reopen the government! Thrilled to rejoin the @TransportDems this Congress. I look forward to working to upgrade our ports and build robust, sustainable infrastructure projects with chairman, @RepPeterDeFazio.

I thank the 6 republicans who put country before party and joined every Senate Democrat to vote to end the #TrumpShutdown The #TrumpShutdown has real costs. All Americans  are affected, directly or indirectly. It must end now. Then, and only then, we can negotiate on border security. https://t.co/9SqIE43Xst The Trump administration has given special treatment to the oil &amp; gas industry behind closed doors for years. Watch now as I lead an effort with my @NRDems colleagues to spotlight blatant favoritism of oil &amp; gas companies throughout the #TrumpShutdown : https://t.co/W2Y2Cmz2km President Trump insists that we need a wall to fight crime—at the same time that he deprives the FBI of critical resources, and disrupts active investigations. https://t.co/xaUIjekeLp This is a tragedy. Healthcare is a human right. As a proud member of the Medicare for all Caucus, I’m fighting to make that right a reality. https://t.co/z5H4oH9nvN Federal workers: resources are available to assist you during the shutdown. We’re working to reopen the government as soon as possible, passing over a dozen proposals to restore funding. Please contact my office if you need help finding resources. https://t.co/FJRAWDGOx7 We won’t legitimize political hostage-taking and allow the President to gut the legal asylum process. Government funding must come before a deal on border security! Too many American families haven’t seen a real pay increase in decades. Tax cuts favoring the wealthy won’t fix that. I’m proud to cosponsor the Raise the Wage Act, which will put money into the pockets of millions of hardworking Americans. I am profoundly disappointed by the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to allow the Trump administration to temporarily implement its discriminatory Transgender military ban. Trans Americans have served our country capably for years, and deserve full equality. This is not over. In honor of Martin Luther King Day, join me in pledging to fight to fulfill the promise of his legacy. We must work every day to build a more just and equal society. My response to President Trump's statement: https://t.co/HGk42DMYRW The Family separation policy was instituted with malice and ineptitude. I saw the haunting impact of the policy when I toured border facilities—but there is much more we need to know. Congress will aggressively investigate. https://t.co/FH1MXbFU8b Our parks and public lands should be helping to offset carbon emissions, but thanks to the Administration’s energy policies, they’re actually contributing to climate change. Check out my op-ed with @RepRaulGrijalva: https://t.co/mdY07VH6uX This week, Trump nominee Andrew Wheeler demonstrated himself to be unfit to lead the EPA. He continued to downplay climate change, and refused to abandon the reckless Trump deregulatory agenda, which has resulted in more pollution and worse health outcomes for thousands. ICYM: This week,  I joined my colleagues @RepRaulGrijalva and @BettyMcCollum04 to demand that the administration stop ordering furloughed federal workers to return to work to serve the interests of oil &amp; gas companies, with shoddy legal justifications. https://t.co/7LOVgFFIeB Forcing federal workers to work without pay under these conditions is profoundly unjust. There’s no way around this crisis, and no easy out. The #TrumpShutdown must end now! https://t.co/uPqMQI5TT7 The economic cost of the shutdown is increasing every day. 800,000 federal workers are suffering, but as payments freeze and government services stall, more and more Americans will feel the pain. We MUST reopen the government BEFORE any negotiations about the border. If these reports are true, the President is in serious legal trouble. In conjunction with the Special Counsel, we will investigate and take all appropriate steps. https://t.co/0hcCOQQEJJ Cancelling Speaker Pelosi’s trip to meet with military officials in Afghanistan interferes with Congress’ constitutional oversight obligations, and harms our national security.

The Senate must do likewise! https://t.co/k8qCzwujcM Lost in the debate about the wall is the environmental impact that vast construction projects can have on delicate ecosystems and communities.

Partisan gerrymandering distorts the electorate. Voters are disenfranchised. Dark money buys influence for the wealthiest. Special interests manipulate the process. Now, change is coming.

It was an honor to join @GabbyGiffords this morning, as we reflected on the terrible impact of gun violence and celebrated her tireless work to end this scourge. I’m proud to support #HR8 and its push for universal background checks. The president seems to have only one tactic: hold innocent Americans hostage, while demonizing anyone who disagrees with him.

A wall won’t change that. 1/2 The #TrumpShutdown leaves hundreds of thousands without pay, paralyzes the IRS,  undermines public health and the environment, jeopardizes SNAP, stops law enforcement activities and threatens our economy. Mr. President, don’t stand in the way. Allow a clean funding bill now. Today, House Democrats introduced bills to prevent offshore oil drilling and protect American coastlines. We won't sacrifice our coastal economies or our environment in the name of oil &amp; gas. We can ensure these ecosystems remain unspoiled for generations to come. It’s time to fulfill our promises.

I led a bipartisan group of members of Congress to urge the Supreme Court to end partisan gerrymandering once and for all last year. As Congress moves to pass its historic HR 1 democracy package, I am pleased that SCOTUS will revisit the issue. We need #FairMaps! The President has dangled pardons in front of witnesses, attacked investigators, and repeatedly mislead the American people. Enough. The new majority will not tolerate obstruction of justice.

It will require states to create independent redistricting commissions and guarantee #fairmaps once and for all. 2/3 I am excited to see the introduction of H.R. 1 today! This sweeping legislation is an important step toward restoring full faith in our democracy. Our government needs to serve the people and the voters above all, not special interests. My statement: https://t.co/rERindh6Ma 1/3 The #TrumpShutdown has gone on too long. The President’s absurd demands for a border wall shouldn’t prevent our government from doing the job we were sent here to do. On Day 1 we passed bills to open the government--the Senate should pass them now. Such an honor to be sworn in to serve the people of California’s 47th district for another term. Now is the time for bold, progressive leadership; for accountability and responsible government.

Stop letting politicians choose their voters and allow real democracy. #FairMaps 6/6 Protecting our democracy takes work, and we need comprehensive reforms to protect the right to vote. We must protect against foreign interference. But we can’t end harmful partisan gerrymandering without making it a national priority. 5/6 Gerrymandering has other consequences beyond partisanship. It divides voters with common interests. If your community is split between many members of congress for partisan gain, how can you be sure people in Washington are looking out for you? 4/6 Gerrymandering is an old process, but the problem is getting worse- new technology and computer modeling can draw ever more undemocratic maps that pinpoint voters and entrench undemocratic results. This is a problem in state legislatures and in congress. 3/6 When politicians draw maps for themselves, self-interest trumps the public good. Picking and choosing electoral coalitions makes the electorate more extreme and weakens our institutions. 2/6 Tomorrow, a new congress will take office, but the threat to our democracy posed by partisan gerrymandering is as severe as ever. Why? A thread: 1/6 Joyous wishes for a happy New Year. 2019 will be an exciting year. We have unique opportunities to make this country a better place. It’s time to get to work. The Endangered Species Act is one of the most successful conservation laws in our history. It has safeguarded out environment and protected countless vulnerable species for decades. On the anniversary of its passage, join me in committing to tirelessly defend our wildlife! We need to promote green energy and invest in programs to protect vulnerable communities from worsening fires and natural disasters. But none of that can happen until we have facts and allow science to guide us, not special interests 2/2 If we’re going to face the threat of climate change, we need real action. The federal government needs to acknowledge the threat with huge investment in green infrastructure, public transportation, and zero emission solutions. 1/2 Merry Christmas to all celebrating. Best wishes from me and my family to yours. I fiercely opposed these measures, and our work isn’t over. We’ll do everything we can to #ProtectTheArctic. 3/3 It also mandated oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, threatening vulnerable ecosystems and wildlife, allowing increased greenhouse emissions and threatening pristine public lands. The Gwich’in people way of life is in jeopardy. 2/3 One year ago, the #GOPtaxscam became law. It exploded the debt with giveaways for the wealthiest and for big corporations, and its long term economic impact was meager. 1/3 The President has decided that his wasteful and unnecessary wall is more important than funding the entire federal government. It's absolutely shameful. This shutdown will hurt innocent people, and Donald Trump knows it. He alone is responsible for the consequences. General Mattis showed honor and courage in his resignation, and his rebuke of President Trump’s reckless and destabilizing agenda. As voices in the Administration fail to constrain the President, know that the new Congress is ready to step up and to hold him accountable. 2/2 Secretary Mattis was a valuable force for stability. He understood the importance of diplomacy, and boldly defended our allies. His departure from the Trump Administration is alarming. The President is acting without a strategy, and will embolden our enemies. 1/2 Betsy DeVos and the administration are putting the NRA and its interests before the safety of our children. Guns have no place in our schools. https://t.co/bbETRv8b6z The @GOP got what they wanted, at least temporarily: a court order striking down the ACA could cause 17 million to lose insurance coverage and could devastate 130 million with preexisting conditions. All this, with no replacement plan. This ruling won’t stand. #ProtectOurCare No one working full time should struggle to make ends meet. It’s time for Congress to act on a fair, livable minimum wage. After the Vietnam War, our country sheltered thousands of innocent people who aided Americans. These refugees built lives here. The Trump administrations attempts to make them eligible for deportation is an outrageous betrayal, and we’re fighting back. More and more disturbing evidence of climate change in the arctic. While we debate the best way to tackle this crucial problem, we’re still faced by far, far too many who are determined to deny these basic facts. We need action, and we need it now. https://t.co/3Re6Rx175N Don’t let the President’s misleading fearmongering fool you: while our border needs security, experts and the American people agree that the wall is a pointless waste of vital resources. https://t.co/O5shAx5Zps We can’t keep allowing policymakers to ignore common sense, to ignore science and to gamble with our futures. Our government needs to put the needs of the American people first. Protecting clean water has been a bipartisan priority for years—the next congress will act. 2/2 Last week saw another effort by this administration to undermine environmental protections. New rules could badly weaken the Clean Water Act, putting special interests and polluters ahead of public health, and our environment.  1/2 https://t.co/sbIxazSvRT RT @TLHumanRights: Thank you @RepLowenthal for all of your support!

We won’t turn our backs on our friends and neighbors: I am proud to join with my colleagues @RepLouCorrea and @HarleyRouda to denounce any move to deport Vietnam War – Era refugees. https://t.co/79i0LCJxEd I was thrilled to meet this week with United Nations Association students who are gathering support for my bipartisan resolution to honor the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We’ll continue work tirelessly to promote human rights at home and abroad. https://t.co/QMsOiM2pfv This innocent girl is the face of the crisis at the border, not some vague threat of “invasion.” We must treat asylum seekers with dignity and respect. I am heartbroken by her loss. https://t.co/O5mK4JrBUs While I have every confidence that last night's ruling against the Affordable Care Act will be overturned, it is indicative of the GOP assault on our healthcare system. We must continue to protect coverage for preexisting conditions at all costs. Sec. Zinke failed to uphold the highest ethical standards and failed to act as a responsible steward of our environment, or our public lands. His record in Puerto Rico was a black mark. I welcome his departure. https://t.co/koQnHHIarn This week I was honored to join @TLHumanRights to recognize their 10 years of leadership on Human Rights in Congress.

Today marks the anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre. The firearm used, an AR-15 style weapon of war, is still legal. Guns like these have claimed far too many lives since that day. Enough is enough. Time to take action and to pass real measures to #EndGunViolence. @HouseGOP The next Congress must move decisively to end the tide of human rights abuses. The United States cannot continue to provide any support to this immoral war. 2/2 Last night the Senate moved decisively with bipartisan support to rebuke the Saudi war in Yemen. @HouseGOP blocked the House from following suit through back-door parliamentary maneuvers—but the days of Saudi impunity are ending. 1/2 RT @RepRickLarsen: Appalled by admin's efforts to deport thousands of Vietnamese immigrants who have lived in our communities &amp; contributed… I am proud to work with @repdinatitus on this important legislation.

I am proud to lead 25 of my colleagues to protest any effort to renegotiate agreements with Vietnam and to jeopardize these Vietnamese Americans. 4/6 These people, and their families, made grave sacrifices and have essentially no home in which they are welcome outside the United States. It would be a grave betrayal to turn our backs on these men and women. 3/6 Vietnam and the United States have a deeply complex history, and our immigration system must acknowledge and accommodate that fact. Thousands of Vietnamese Americans living in the United States fought alongside American troops. 2/6 I am deeply disturbed by the Trump Administration’s efforts to subject thousands of immigrants from Vietnam to deportation. Presidents Obama and Bush recognized need to protect these people, who include Vietnam War-era refugees and have lived in the US for decades. 1/6 Yet another unacceptable move to weaken protections for our environment and public health. #DirtyWaterRule puts polluters ahead of clean drinking water for millions. We can’t let that happen.

I’m proud to join @RepBarragan to work to end this injustice.  https://t.co/yRpOMiSemy Today is the 3rd anniversary of the Paris Climate Accords. If the President continues to ignore climate change, the next congress will act to ensure tough limits on harmful carbon emissions. We can’t afford to wait. The President’s longtime personal attorney received a 3-year prison sentence for crimes that directly implicate President Trump.  There is much more to uncover. We’re ready to hold the administration accountable.  https://t.co/cVAvoKmzgV @HouseGOP The House is poised to uphold the constitution and take a stand against a brutal war, which has seen numerous severe and ongoing human rights violations. It has nothing to do with debating the Farm Bill—this is an outrageous move to silence the voice of Congress. 2/2 This is outrageous. @HouseGOP is using back-door parliamentary tricks to block a vote on constitutional oversight of US involvement in the Saudi War in Yemen. 1/2

https://t.co/OLZBMMU45H Partisan gerrymandering is wrong. Not because it disadvantages one side, but because we live in a country where voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. I’m working every day for #FairMaps The Department of Homeland Security’s moves to change Public Charge immigration rules are a needless effort to cut legal immigration levels. They will leave American communities sicker, poorer, and more vulnerable. I joined over 100 of my colleagues to stand in opposition. The President is directly implicated in financial crimes committed by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. It’s serious. But there is much more to investigate. We’ll protect the investigators as they #FollowtheFacts.  https://t.co/DKvQ5aJQoL The wall is pointless and wasteful. The American people don’t want it. And yet President Trump is threatening to hurt innocent people by shutting down the Government for it. Absurd. The administration banded together with Saudi Arabia, Russia and others to block the adoption of a UN report on the growing threat of climate change. We can’t keep hiding from the truth. I’m working to end this insanity. https://t.co/sYfFojtJbn
