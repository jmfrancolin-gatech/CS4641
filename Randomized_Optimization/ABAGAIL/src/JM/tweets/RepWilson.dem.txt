If accepted, these exemplary students from my district will matriculate next fall at one of the elite U.S. military academies serving our nation. Let's all wish them the best! https://t.co/qc0BTp7NKO We continue to work toward securing the freedom of the 112 #ChibokGirls still captive. Boko Haram's brutal campaign in Nigeria must be stopped, for the sake of their future victims and all those that have suffered so much. 
#BBOG https://t.co/Sl8MjBH3ae SMH: These kinds of incidences must end!#BankingWhileBlack 

https://t.co/NDrOfIAjoG I applaud the passage of a criminal justice reform bill, but cannot forget that it is just a first step and does not affect the state and local systems that feed the school-to-prison pipeline and support disparate treatment of people of color. https://t.co/qZcZgo3L7M Our teachers are not first responders; they already have a very  important job. As a former educator, I know how ridiculous the  administration‚Äôs proposal to arm teachers is, especially when the real  solution to school shootings is clear: gun reform!
https://t.co/C32vX65r1v @5000RoleModels @zoomiami Role Model Denzel you are the pride and joy of the 5000 Role Models Of Excellence Program. Go Maudie Ives Elementary. Go 5000!  Go Zoo Miami!@zoomiami .@BetsyDeVosED actively seeks opportunities to undermine student protections. Her latest attack takes aim at an Obama-era policy to prevent racial disparities in school discipline that punish minority students more harshly than their white counterparts. https://t.co/ky7vgLsjuG I am pleased the Farm Bill passed without a harmful work requirement provision for SNAP recipients that would have cut benefits for more than 1 million households already struggling to put food on the table. https://t.co/0ZjiGNRzlD Thank you to my colleagues who continue to stand for the freedom of the #ChibokGirls. We remain committed to #BringBackOurGirls. https://t.co/XndXRobLg3 @5000RoleModels @FIU Role Model Price Destinobles FIU 2018. We are so very proud of you. You are 5000‚ù§Ô∏è There are just a few hours left! #GetCovered, https://t.co/VNrW8pCfjc Time is running out! Open enrollment closes tonight. #GetCovered while you still can. https://t.co/Ke5sPjjBhN I cannot wait until Democrats take over the House in January and lead the charge against actions like this that put Americans‚Äô health at risk. https://t.co/YF8hDt7Shm This is the last day of open enrollment. Give yourself and your family peace of mind and #GetCovered for 2019! https://t.co/H6KqoVrpTG "A survey conducted by UNICEF indicates that the population of out of school children in Nigeria has risen from 10.5 million to 13.2 million, the highest in the world." This is a devastating reminder of Boko Haram's impact and why they must be stopped.
https://t.co/TFED1hSKQQ Despite the Texas judge‚Äôs ruling, Obamacare stays in place. Today is the last day of open enrollment for coverage in 2019. #GetCovered! This sounds an awful lot like blaming the victim to me, RT if you agree!
https://t.co/UvrGtaNVwr I am deeply saddened by this news. We need answers about how this happened, but it is a painful reminder of the need for humane immigration policies. 
https://t.co/H2IadEK4L6 Give someone, especially a child, you know and love an extra hug today in honor of the children and staff who lost their lives during the mass shooting at #SandyHook and their families. #SandyHook6yrsLater https://t.co/u7e8atfZ3J Our hearts are with the 112 #ChibokGirls still held captive and we haven't given up on this fight! #BringBackOurGirlsNOW https://t.co/NOSvB4qVR8 Minority &amp; low-income communities across the U.S., like the one I represent, face similar barriers: high unemployment &amp; crime rates, inadequate access to health care &amp; good schools. In the next Congress, Democrats must fight #ForThePeople who struggle most. Miami-Dade &amp; Broward counties each contain two separate worlds: one for those with resources &amp; another for those without. Gallop Poll once named the ones I represent as the ‚Äúnation‚Äôs most suffering,‚Äù That‚Äôs why I fight so hard to give voice to the voiceless. Tomorrow marks one year since the FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. Over the past year, millions of Americans have voiced their support for restoring #NetNeutrality rules and it is time for Congress to listen. I will continue to fight for the free and open internet! https://t.co/d140M9cEJi Thank you to these colleagues and many more who continue to support the fight to #BringBackOurGirls. @RepSarbanes @LisaBRochester @GKButterfield https://t.co/tHt5Q9CAIc @5000RoleBCPS @RobertwRuncie @dwatkins1 @BrowardOSPA @fredistouch15 @OSPA_Cadre8 @Hallandale_HS @browardschools @Mr_InstrCoach @Justaboutpeople That is absolutely spectacular! @5000RoleBCPS @RobertwRuncie @dwatkins1 @BrowardOSPA @fredistouch15 @OSPA_Cadre8 @Hallandale_HS @browardschools @Mr_InstrCoach @Justaboutpeople Congratulations to the student leaders who are serving as true Role Models for their peers.

We also share a commitment to #BringBackOurGirls! https://t.co/xzj2mZOyG5 ‚ÄúThe United States has announced the designation of Boko Haram as an entity ‚Äòof particular concern‚Äô.  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, in a statement, designated Boko Haram alongside ISIS, al-Qa‚Äôida and al-Shabab."
https://t.co/J7EOjHHD8X Americans called for a Congress that works #ForThePeople in the last Congress ‚Äì not another #TrumpShutdown. How you could think otherwise is beyond me.
