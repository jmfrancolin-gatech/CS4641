It is our duty to expand opportunities for the education of our heroes‚Äô children and offer these families the support they deserve. Because of frequent moves and a lack of school choice, children in military families feel the negative impact. This is why I introduced the Military Child Educational Freedom Act today. Our brave women and men in uniform fight on the front lines for our freedom. Not only are we grateful to our heroes, but also to their families for their service. The average child in a military family moves six to nine times in his or her school career.
