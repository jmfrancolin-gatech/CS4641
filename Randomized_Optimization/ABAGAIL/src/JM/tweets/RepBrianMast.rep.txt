https://t.co/y0yrj68htT PASSED THE HOUSE: The Veterans Access to Child Care Act
Our bill requires the VA to provide child care assistance to veterans who are receiving care for mental illness. Childcare should not be a barrier to patients seeking care from the VA! https://t.co/dmdsqBv2hM It’s long past time for the Army Corps to be held accountable for their actions. My bill - The Toxic Health Threat Warning Act - will require the Army Corps to notify the public before discharging toxic waters into our communities. My goal: no more discharges. https://t.co/MLDxPKCjzN Our communities deserve to know if there's something toxic or hazardous headed in their direction. My bill—The Toxic Health Threat Warning Act—would require the Army Corps to notify the public of any toxic discharges from Lake O.
https://t.co/m8EuGXv4Iz Notifying the public when their health is in danger is the basic level of good governance (no discharges is real goal). It’s time for the Army Corps to take ownership of the toxic discharges from Lake Okeechobee. https://t.co/UNt99x5wFp You can definitely add my name to the long list of people who are ardently opposed to any drilling in the Everglades. Absurd and horrifying is right. https://t.co/T3AZnnT5QD RT @OurOcean: Hats off to bipartisanship in Congress with the coast-to-coast #OceanClimateAction by @congbillposey @RepBonamici @RepBrianMa… Great story @ChrisRuden! https://t.co/tZ8inQSG46 Scientists have linked toxic algae to severe illness &amp; even death, so why did the Army Corps discharge water 50 times too toxic for human contact into our communities from Lake O last summer? My bill will hold them accountable for their dangerous actions.
https://t.co/RiWgGArjxP This week I introduced the Toxic Health Threat Warning Act, which will:
✅Protect the public health of our communities
✅Require water to be tested before discharging from Lake O

https://t.co/MA9WPI0t4A @llco The Democrats were using this resolution to play politics, pointing fingers instead of trying to come up with solutions - that's a waste of time.  We need real policy not wasting taxpayer dollars to try to help one political party or another in 2020. For too long, the South Florida Water Management District has lacked transparency. Thanks to @GovRonDeSantis’ leadership, the SFWMD board will finally represent the people, not special interests.

Welcome to Congress, @ElectJimBaird &amp; @DanCrenshawTX. https://t.co/NU7YnbAE4u When servicemembers first put on that uniform, we make a set of promises to them.
