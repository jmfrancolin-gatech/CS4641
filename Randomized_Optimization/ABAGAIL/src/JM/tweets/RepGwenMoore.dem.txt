I'm here to serve, folks! https://t.co/bvtQDiMjLb In just a few days, @HouseDemocrats are going to take back the gavel and move forward with our plan to end the #TrumpShutdown. It's time Washington start working #ForThePeople.
https://t.co/aPJCSujlnx On day 7 of #TrumpShutdown, @realDonaldTrump instructed 420,000 fed employees working without pay to trade manual labor for reduced rent.

Instead of forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to work TWO jobs this holiday, Trump needs to do his ONE job &amp; reopen the government. https://t.co/sHEQz4EpeS Fact check: The 400,000+ Americans working without pay this holiday are NOT all (or mostly) Democrats. 

But Democrats sure are going to be the ones who get these folks their money back when we take the gavel in January. https://t.co/GcmBzLFSYA Habari gani? #Umoja (Unity)!

His response? To attack the @federalreserve on @Twitter &amp; cause the Dow to fall even more. This country needs a leader, not a twitter account. https://t.co/abxISqk0VF This weekend, I talked to @funder about #TrumpShutdown, #TrumpResign, and if @realDonaldTrump is fit to serve. Tune in to my interview w/ #DworkinReport to find out why I think Trump should just go quietly and spare us all a whole lot of pain. https://t.co/gul9y4IUAq The #TrumpShutdown has allowed #VAWA to expire, blocking funding for programs that support survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence &amp; stalking. 

This is a shameful moment for our nation. #VAWA protections save lives. RT @funder: Trump must resign. Retweet if you agree.

His behavior &amp; this shutdown are inexcusable. For the sake of our nation, House Republicans &amp; President Trump need to do their job, fund the government, &amp; put an end to this mess. https://t.co/ABjzPBpx2m 78% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck.

These people have families, car payments, student loans etc. &amp; many live paycheck to paycheck. ICYMI #TrumpShutdown forces them to work the busiest time of the year w/o pay. https://t.co/mya6TTanj9 I've been saying for a long time that the one honorable thing Trump could do would be to put down his cell phone and go peacefully into the dark.

https://t.co/IdL9Q0GzfP Taxpayers don't want a wall, they don't want to pay for a wall, and they sure as hell don't want the government to shut down because of the wall.

Looks like @HouseGOP couldn't resist throwing the American public under the bus just one more time before they leave office. https://t.co/lrSO3pFao3 Today, I joined @NormaJTorres &amp; @RepTedLieu in demanding @SecNielsen put an end to @DHSgov's policy of deterring migrants seeking asylum at our border. They're creating a humanitarian crisis &amp; endangering the lives of more innocent children like #JakelinCaal. It needs to end. https://t.co/aZMyMlp6nx Working on it, @DavidFBowen! https://t.co/fjB7iADwYI RT @NancyPelosi: We should be working to help hungry Americans, not take away their food. Yet under a new rule proposed by the Trump Admin‚Ä¶ SNAP is one of our nation‚Äôs MOST effective anti-poverty programs.

Last year, the program lifted 3.4 million people out of poverty. 

Trump needs to take his #handsoff our food aid. https://t.co/XOjcgEt8Jr RT @RepRaulGrijalva: As Trump throws a temper tantrum over his #BorderWall, a #TrumpShutdown would force 420,000 federal employees to work‚Ä¶ ICYMI: In the year since the #TaxScam became law, the Dow fell more than 1,800 points, the deficit increased by more than $100 billion, &amp; wages remained stagnant.

The public has spoken. They want quality, affordable care. It's long past time for Washington to give it to them. #ProtectOurCare .@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP tried everything to undermine ACA open enrollment this year. Not only did they cut marketing by 90% &amp; the navigator program by 70%, but they also created intentional confusion with Friday's court ruling. https://t.co/5ABNLxqnTA Don't give up. Don't give out. And don't give in.

Thank you, @SenKamalaHarris. https://t.co/yvufQD8pL8 Paul Ryan is leaving behind a major mess in Washington, and I am SO ready to start cleaning it up. https://t.co/mKR6NelRKg A year after the #TaxScam passed, here‚Äôs where we stand:

Not only does it read like @NRA wrote it, but it also attacks critical protections for Black &amp; brown students designed by the Obama admin to combat discrimination in our schools. https://t.co/7QUydlnxiH Trump's threats to shut down the government are more befitting of The Apprentice than the presidency. He can't force the American public to pay for his wall, and we won't let him. https://t.co/0dsyPZmUs8 Republicans are doing everything they can to hold on to power, including disenfranchising Black and brown Milwaukeeans.
