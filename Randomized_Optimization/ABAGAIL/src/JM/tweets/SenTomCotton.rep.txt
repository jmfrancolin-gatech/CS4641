Make no mistake: The brutal police tactics in Xinjiang are not just an assault on that province’s native people, although they’re surely that.

There is not a single benefit in the bill for the victims of these criminals. Opponents falsely claim victim notification amendment wouldn’t allow victims to opt-out of notification. Current law for other notifications doesn’t mention “opt-outs,” but Bureau of Prisons still provides it. This will not change. The amendment I offered with @SenJohnkennedy, cosponsored by Senators Barrasso, Kyl, Sasse, and Toomey, would notify victims before their victimizer is granted early prerelease custody and give victims a chance to make a statement to the warden.

Criminals get a lot of benefits in First Step Act. Why not at least give victims notice? https://t.co/7hlFmCRRhB The senate should unanimously pass @SenatorLankford amendment #4121 to fix language in current bill that discriminates against Christian and other religious groups. Proud to sponsor this fix. Faith-based groups deserve full participation in federal prison system. I'm proud to have @SenJohnKennedy, @SenJohnBarrasso, Senator Kyl, @SenSasse, and @SenToomey as cosponsors for this amendment. We only need 51 votes to make this bill a little better and safer. I urge all my colleagues to support it. Now, please tell me which of the crimes in my amendment should remain eligible for early release time credits. Coercing a child to engage in sexual activity? Assaulting law enforcement? Assaulting a child? Carjacking? Bank robbery? Hate crimes? They should all be made ineligible. Opponents of my amendment continue to push false claim it “would make virtually all federal prisoners ineligible for earned time credits,” so I’m posting analysis from bipartisan US Sentencing Commission confirming 62% of prisoners are still eligible if my amendment‘s adopted: https://t.co/ynwVta0e6E I also strongly support @jiminhofe's amendment #4141 that would fix the unconstitutional, unfunded mandate in the First Step Act that could bankrupt local jails. This is a serious issue in the bill that has received little attention thus far. And @SenSasse would also get rid of the section that reduces the penalty for repeat fentanyl trafficking in amendment #4142. Fentanyl traffickers deserve no leniency. I strongly support. In amendment #4143, @SenSasse would fix the "productive activities" loophole that allows violent felons to gain early release credits by playing softball. Why do bill authors allow “productive activities” to qualify? The @SenSasse amendment #4144 deserves support. It bans felons who assault police officers, violent bank robbers, and carjackers from early release. Violent offenders should not be eligible for early release to home confinement or to “supervised release.” My colleague @Senorrinhatch has introduced comprehensive mens rea reform in amendment #4137 that I hope will be accepted by my colleagues. Disappointed this was not included in bill. And @SenToomey amendment #4120 would provide more funding for victims of violent crimes. This is an outstanding and much-needed amendment that deserves my colleagues’ support. I also support @SenToomey amendment #4119 that increases the penalty against violent felons who stalk children. I am proud to support @SenToomey First Step Act amendment #4118 that would raise the penalty for felons who murder police officers or first responders by ensuring that capital punishment is an option. While I still have concerns with First Step Act, I strongly support and am proud to sponsor @SenatorLankford amendment #4121 to ensure faith-based organizations can work with prisoners to improve lives and reduce recidivism. I urge my colleagues to pass this common sense fix. It’s fair to disagree on the merits of offering early release as an incentive to “low-risk” violent offenders, but this claim being circulated is not true. Proponents of the FSA misleadingly claim my amendment “would make virtually all federal prisoners ineligible for earned time credits.” But the U.S. Sentencing Commission confirms 62% of federal prisoners would remain eligible even if my amendment is adopted. The Cotton-Kennedy Amdts to FSA exclude all violent felons &amp; sex offenders from any early release credits. Current bill allows 1,466 sex offenders convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2422 to qualify for time credits. Our amendment fixes this. cc: @SenJohnKennedy https://t.co/rkOVyanDwD https://t.co/cXhBSq1Fg5 READ my op-ed in @NRO "Fix the First Step Act and Keep Violent Criminals behind Bars" https://t.co/W4QbabE0tz CBO says implementing First Step Act will increase deficit by $352M. https://t.co/lCjZeMmWQn https://t.co/nJXikWAu2p Unfortunately, @hughhewitt, these types of criminals would still be eligible for early release—unless my and @SenJohnKennedy’s amendment to exclude all violent offenders &amp; sex offenders is adopted next week. But we only need 51 votes to adopt our amendment, &amp; I remain optimistic. https://t.co/1B6xPoDpNW Grateful to the @NAPOpolice and other law enforcement and victims’ rights groups for their support of the Cotton-Kennedy Amendments https://t.co/QU2WlNGIia CC:@SenJohnKennedy The Cotton-Kennedy amendment will exclude all sex offenders and violent felons from
the time credits. https://t.co/kUkvRtKyMu And in spite of those changes, felons who attempt to coerce minors into illicit sexual activity under 18 U.S.C 2422(b) are still eligible for the time credits. First Step Act proponents preposterously claim original bill “already excluded sex offenders.”

Yet on same “fact” sheet, they announce changes to the bill to newly exclude certain sex offenders. https://t.co/3j9jhXoKzH Happy birthday to our National Guard.

Why won't sponsors of the new First Step Act make the text public? What are they hiding? Many of the proposed changes closely mirror my own legislative solution to this regulatory problem, and I'm pleased that the Trump administration has followed through on its promise to rural America. Everyone wants clean water, but the 2015 ‘waters of the U.S.' rule was a vast &amp; vague expansion of federal regulation, especially in Arkansas. The new definition announced today still protects our waterways while giving producers &amp; landowners the clarity they need to farm &amp; build Fake news? Then why did new bill change to exclude more violent felons? Unfortunately, new version still allows multiple classes of violent sex offenders to get early release. https://t.co/rrfyFX2HDY I look forward to debating this bill on the Senate floor and introducing amendments to address its many remaining threats to public safety. Crimes still eligible for early release in the latest version of the bill:
1. Bank robbery with a dangerous weapon (18 U.S.C. § 2113(d))
2. Assault against a child (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5))
3. Carjacking with intent to cause death (18 U.S.C. 2119(1)) Unfortunately, the bill still has major problems &amp; allows early release for many categories of serious, violent criminals. This includes felons who commit violent bank robberies with dangerous weapons, who assault children, &amp; who commit carjacking with the intent to cause death. For months I’ve said the First Step Act allows violent felons and sex offenders to be released early. I’m pleased the drafters have finally acknowledged that reality and made changes to address some of the specific issues I pointed out. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass legislation addressing these malign activities of the Chinese Communist Party during the 116th Congress.

Anna and I join all Americans in thanking General Kelly and Karen for their service and sacrifice. Semper Fi, General Kelly. General Mark Milley has been an outstanding Army Chief of Staff and will be an excellent Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He’s a warrior and cares deeply for the troops. Congratulations! That’s why this bill’s sponsor list IS its whip list. In fact, the sponsor list is longer than the whip list because even some sponsors don’t want it to become law. So when cornered by a zealous bill sponsor, most senators will hem &amp; haw, trim, &amp; hedge. They will say something abstract like, “I agree, we need to do something,” etc etc. But then they tell the whip they don’t want to touch the bill with a 10-foot pole. Let me explain the facts of Senate life. Politicians hate to say no, especially to other politicians. 

https://t.co/09mLZNYxDO Only thing worse than early release from prison of thousands of serious, violent, &amp; repeat felons is to do that in a spending bill with no debate or amendments, forcing senators to either shut down government or let felons out of prison. If the jailbreak bill gets stuck in the spending bill, everyone bring your stockings to the Senate, because we’ll be there on Christmas! https://t.co/9uuEq6z6uw Great to see representatives from several Arkansas chambers of commerce in DC today! https://t.co/51D2yRbUxf Thanks @SGottliebFDA for your prompt attention to this report and commitment to improving the important orphan drug program. https://t.co/4KwtDraAtE While ODA has successfully encouraged development of treatments for rare diseases, the GAO report @senorrinhatch, @ChuckGrassley, and I requested shows how FDA's mismanagement allowed abuse of the law's incentives. FDA must act on these recommendations.

https://t.co/5XvCDyn8tE This loophole is dangerous and should be removed from the bill. Current safety valve already allows truly low-level, first time offenders a break. Why do proponents want to let repeat offenders with lengthy, violent histories off the hook? Many violent felons who served &lt;12 months would be eligible. Reduced sentence under safety valve = earlier release than current law. According to DOJ, because Brock Turner only served 3 months for his crime, he will not be excluded from new safety valve if he commits a future drug trafficking crime. He is excluded today. What’s a “serious violent felony”? Only a violent crime where a defendant actually served 12 months or longer. https://t.co/EkqZVTSWzp First Step Act allows lengthy criminal histories to get reduced sentences, &amp; adds massive, dangerous loophole. Judges can waive criminal record requirements as long as defendant hasn’t committed a “serious violent felony” or “serious drug felony.” See text. https://t.co/6dGmXaIXxg Today, ‘safety valve’ in fed law allows fed judges to ignore mandatory minimums and sentence certain defendants to reduced time. It’s meant for rare, truly first-time cases, so one condition is defendant must have no or very limited state or fed criminal history. First Step Act says crimes are “serious violent felonies” only if prisoner served 12+ months. Brock Turner, who served just 3 months for sexual assault, is not a “serious violent felon” under the jailbreak bill. Here is why that matters.

Reagan deserves high praise for negotiating the INF Treaty more than 30 years ago, but the world is a different place today &amp; we need to change old policies to ward off new threats.

The jailbreak bill has dangerous loophole that could give early release to medium- &amp; high-risk sex offenders. https://t.co/awk0gFYpg0 Today I joined @SenWarren in introducing the National POW/MIA Flag Act. It's my hope that this small gesture reminds Americans to honor those who left our shores and never returned. https://t.co/Ajhw1YLbGQ The Iranian regime’s continued practice of hostage taking places it among the worst human rights abusers on earth. Congress should immediately pass the Iran Hostage Act to hold the Ayatollahs accountable for their barbarism.

Bush’s patriotism and dedication to public service inspired us all. I join all Arkansans in mourning the loss of this great man. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family. "The FIRST STEP bill may be well-intentioned and it contains some useful provisions, but reducing sentences by years is profoundly misguided and will have deleterious effects on society. The Senate should reject the FIRST STEP Act as currently written."

https://t.co/uxWWiH35hY Congratulations to Col. Ingram on your historic achievement. The state of Arkansas is proud of your tenacity and leadership.

https://t.co/VAQJ6CJiRB RT @WashTimes: .@SenTomCotton: "My Senate colleagues should take the time to fix the flaws in this legislation instead of rushing a bill th… .@CharlesFLehman: The bill “would unilaterally free thousands of federal offenders without any exposure to expanded anti-recidivism programming, regardless of how those individuals would be rated by First Step’s new risk assessment tool.” @weeklystandard https://t.co/je83O35YSy I’m glad sponsors are rewriting FIRST STEP Act and acknowledge that last draft allows violent sex offenders to qualify for early release. They need to fix all the bill’s problems—not just some of them—and release text so Senators and public can see. https://t.co/BKJ5b8Qd0J Today @Liz_Cheney and I introduced the Stopping Russian Nuclear Aggression Act to limit Russia’s nuclear buildup https://t.co/89hULddxKP Congratulations to the great men and women @AerojetRdyne for their role in the successful @MarsInsight landing!  Job well done team! I commend New Zealand for joining their Australian neighbors in blocking Huawei from their 5G network. I urge all our allies to think twice before allowing the Chinese Communist Party to gain a foothold in their critical infrastructure.

https://t.co/NDLuMnlj1p ICYMI: My interview with @hughhewitt on criminal justice reform https://t.co/pVnZ3IjOr7 I have asked the Small Business Administration to reverse a proposed rule that would deny family poultry farmers in Arkansas critical access to capital. This rule endangers their livelihoods and those of other small businesses owners across Arkansas.

https://t.co/15GZEYoISS “Now that the Department of Justice has confirmed that the Senate FIRST STEP Act offers early release to multiple categories of sex offenders in several provisions of the bill, Congress should fix these problems instead of ramming this bill through."

https://t.co/B8iM6bb8kQ Major law enforcement organizations overwhelmingly oppose the First Step Act: https://t.co/CXJLx3Y9AD A new Justice Department analysis "found that the Senate’s bipartisan sentencing and prison reform bill could make people convicted of some sex crimes eligible for early release."

https://t.co/B8iM6bsJco Thanks, @marcorubio. I look forward to discussing this with you further. https://t.co/15UP7B1ZPJ RT @NRO: Senator @TomCottonAR urges fellow conservatives to take a second look at the FIRST STEP Act. https://t.co/E1qJptthSg https://t.co/… Last year, 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. Why does the bill reduce the penalty for repeat fentanyl and heroin traffickers? Why not add these crimes to the 'exclusion from early-release' list? 1.  Drug-related robberies involving assault with a dangerous weapon (U.S.C. § 2118(c)(1))
2. Assault resulting in substantial bodily injury to a child (U.S.C. §113(a)(7)
3. Threats to assault, kidnap, or murder a federal judge or official (U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(b)) While the bill excludes some crimes from earning the new early release “time credits”, why are the following crimes missing from the exclusion list? Can @senmikelee promise the American people that nothing in the criminal justice bill gives any type of early release to violent sex offenders? https://t.co/VuB242SQzJ Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours. Wherever you are, I hope you’re surrounded by family &amp; friends. Thanksgiving is a time of gratitude, for our families, for our many blessings as a nation &amp; for our troops who are far from home. We all have much &amp; many to be thankful for .@SenMikeLee sunlight and debate are good things. Looking forward to a robust debate of bill’s text and its impact on public safety. It’s true that for this new time-credit system, BOP needs to classify as “low-risk”, although other provisions in bill still apply to “high-risk” prisoners. But do you trust BOP to have perfect judgment about recidivism-risk? Why not just exclude? Some criminals are ineligible for new credits, but many serious &amp; violent felons are eligible, because “ineligible convictions” list is inadequate. One example eligible for early release under the bill:  18 U.S.C. 113(a)(7) – assaulting a child resulting in serious bodily injury.
