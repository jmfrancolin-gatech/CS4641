The House has voted multiple times to re-open government. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/HOxS0UDk4Y RT @Shareblue: Trump shutdown could cost taxpayers billions by the time it‚Äôs over

https://t.co/oLHkqPqOHp RT @TheDemocrats: The American people have spoken: They want the #TrumpShutdown to end. https://t.co/aJ5CExtPr8 #ThanksTrump https://t.co/9zo3NmfC0q "Trump boasts that he leads w his gut. He can‚Äôt be bothered w all the details of governing, remaining ignorant of how anything works in Washington ‚Äî the presidency, Congress, Constitution. That‚Äôs left him in a standoff for which he was wholly unprepared." https://t.co/GooKqmSs3q Democrats are committed to border security ‚Äì but Trump‚Äôs wall isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs inffective. It‚Äôs wasteful. And the way he‚Äôs going about trying to get it is hurting American families. #EndTheShutdown Last week, my House colleagues &amp; I voted to reopen the government ‚Äì and this week, we did so again, with one goal being to ensure Americans received their tax refunds on time. When will Republicans step up and help end this irresponsible #TrumpShutdown? Americans aren‚Äôt getting paid because of this irresponsible, wasteful shutdown. Why does @SenateMajLdr refuse to allow a vote to reopen government? #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/zESZ2W4mpU "You know the system has broken down when the clearest way out of a government shutdown may be for the president to declare a fake national emergency." https://t.co/AD84vCBFbn #trumpshutdown 21 days into the #TrumpShutdown, Americans are starting to receive their $0 paystubs from the federal government ‚Äì all because @realDonaldTrump is throwing a tantrum to try and get his wasteful wall. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/XOU7SdAA86 "Someone needs to gently explain to the president that, going forward, he might want to adjust his negotiating strategy." https://t.co/D4U8IlPxpb #trumpshutdown RT @RepCummings: Because of the Trump shutdown, the Census Bureau may run out of funding in February to continue preparations for the 2020‚Ä¶ RT @IlhanMN: Today should be payday, but 800,000 workers are waking up to find their checks withheld.

Meanwhile federal contractors are lo‚Ä¶ RT @TheDemocrats: Trump is holding workers‚Äô paychecks hostage over a manufactured crisis. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/‚Ä¶ .@nytimes Editorial: What Trump Could Learn From His Shutdown https://t.co/dtlrHFWx3d #trumpshutdown Finally, This Bill Is Vital Because, Under the Trump Shutdown, Access to Health Services for Many American Indians and Alaska Natives Is In Serious Jeopardy This Bill Is Also Critical for Americans‚Äô Health, Because EPA Inspections of Chemical Factories, Power Plants, and Other Industrial Sites Will Begin Again The immediate enactment of this bill is critical to ensure that all of our treasured National Parks, National Monuments, and other sites managed by the National Park Service (NPS) are re-opened and fully staffed, before any of them are damaged further. While the National Parks Are Becoming Unsafe and Filled with Garbage Under the Shutdown, This Bill Will Open Up All National Parks and Bring Back the Vitally Needed Staff and Services While @realDonaldTrump continues to drag the nation deep into Week 3 of gov Shutdown, Dems are taking action to lead our country out of this mess.  On Day 1, we took first steps to restore certainty by passing a complete funding package with Senate GOP language to re-open gov't. Today, the House will consider H.R. 266, FY 2019 Interior-Environment Appropriations bill, a bill that is virtually identical to the bipartisan appropriations bill that Senate Republicans and Democrats passed in August by a vote of 92 to 6. Democrats believe health care is a right for all, and we must build on our success in 2018 by beating Donald Trump, taking back the U.S. Senate, and electing more Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight to ensure that every American has access to the care they deserve. Millions of Americans will pay higher premiums this year because of Trump and Republican sabotage, and millions more are priced out of the market and unable to afford coverage. For nearly a decade now, the Republican Party has been defined by its cruel, costly, and relentless goal to take away people‚Äôs health care. While 17 Democratic attorneys general are now appealing this decision, it‚Äôs all too clear that Republicans are not serious about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/VUhVHu7asH Republicans came as close as they‚Äôve ever been to destroying the Affordable Care Act and taking health care away from millions of Americans after last month‚Äôs lower court decision. Yesterday, House Democrats voted to intervene in the Republican lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, keeping their campaign promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions and fight against Republican health care sabotage. Working together, Democrats will honor the public‚Äôs trust, and put the power back in the hands of the people: (1) Reducing the role of big money in politics; (2) Advancing fair elections by strengthening the Voting Rights Act; (3) Restoring ethics and integrity to Washington.
