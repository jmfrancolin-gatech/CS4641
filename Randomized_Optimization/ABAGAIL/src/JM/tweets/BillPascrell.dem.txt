This is a stunning autopsy. Laid out in brutal detail by @Publici, the #GopTaxScam was passed at the behest of republicans‚Äô billionaire donors.

Who picked up their tab? You did.

https://t.co/YzkTW4T9HC #Sunlight on the #TrumpTaxReturns will reveal whether Donald Trump has any financial conflicts of interest and if his decisions are impacted by foreign entanglements. Thank you @cspan for having me! https://t.co/tqXUDAgon1 About to step on with @cspan to discuss the #TrumpTaxReturns and other issues of the morning. #TuneIn or #CallIn ‚Äî would love to chat with you! https://t.co/qu3E4HOUyY They called John ‚ÄòMr. Chairman‚Äô not because of seniority but out of respect. There wasn‚Äôt a colleague, ever, that had a cross word for John. He is one of the greatest members that ever came through this place. My family grieves with Debbie. https://t.co/rNWVJIhvgt It‚Äôs been a long road, but we‚Äôre finally moving to expose Trump to true transparency. Americans deserve to know if their leader is a crook. Thank you as always for your yeoman‚Äôs work @CharlesPPierce.

https://t.co/MTM2bIdNFM Remember this the next time republicans claim that exposing the #TrumpTaxReturns to sunlight is a ‚Äúfishing expedition.‚Äù Talk about chutzpah. https://t.co/7z6xThLQj5 There is a lot disingenuousness at this hearing. 

Congress didn‚Äôt need to request Trump‚Äôs modern predecessors‚Äô tax returns bc they all disclosed them voluntarily! https://t.co/YHdvveBUBi I submitted for the @WaysMeansCmte oversight hearing record three stories laying out troubling financial dealings from this president. There are plenty more. #Sunlight https://t.co/F4fwDAxdfb I‚Äôm at the first hearing on the #TrumpTaxReturns, live at the link below. After two long years, oversight has begun.

https://t.co/PiaoIE7bdR There‚Äôs more baloney in this thread than in a butcher shop. https://t.co/Ihmlhahemh As Trump thunders incoherently at any oversight, Democrats are prepared to conduct a thorough analysis of the #TrumpTaxReturns so that we can see any potential conflicts of interest he may have. Americans have waited long enough for #sunlight. https://t.co/IGc5V1SYyR Just wrapped up a terrific meeting w/ Govt Accountability Office head Gene Dodaro. @USGAO is the brains and watchdog of our govt.

Oversight is Congress‚Äôs job. And today, at long last, we‚Äôre holding our first hearing on pres tax returns.

https://t.co/DWIsoNGzvY Delighted to host @KatyTurNBC today at our office to discuss congressional dysfunction, Newt Gingrich‚Äôs toxic legacy, Gateway Tunnel, and how to fix Washington. #Staytuned https://t.co/naVnYDrQEj Reminder: The #TrumpShutdown held federal workers hostage for 35 days and cost our economy $11 billion. https://t.co/EBjegn9z3h The cost of climate change is astronomically high.

The cost of ignoring climate change is even higher. https://t.co/1zO64jcJfe For decades, a super-majority of Americans have demanded commonsense gun violence reforms. 

For the first time in eight long years, the House will hold hearings on gun violence. Finally. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/w95eMPwUqx I know. I sat through it. https://t.co/K59WrxE60A This was a touching moment in the chamber. But we must pass real, commonsense gun control measures. Americans cry out for them.

Will Trump and republicans finally work with us to stop gun violence? #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/VHwLMa9vLx OTOH, hearing my republican colleagues clapping for our withdrawal from the INF treaty makes my blood boil. Trump‚Äôs idiotic move will hasten a nuclear arms race. The only other one who likes it is Putin.

He is bereft of honor or plain decency. https://t.co/gmSoavXcbj America has lost an inspiring hero and a member of the Greatest Generation. Godspeed Mr. Overton. https://t.co/et61jnerk7 My floor speech reading the Steele Dossier into the record is available here. And I discussed Trump and the Russia investigation in this thread. https://t.co/GE81xSTPIp

https://t.co/aWg9CeN3c6 This summer, in response to a cavalcade of lies by Trump and his associates about their contacts w/Russian officials, I read the Steele Dossier into the Congressional Record. If accurate, this report confirms yet another element of the dossier. https://t.co/JZ1MNcC0q2 On day six of the #TrumpShutdown, OPM is advising govt employees to send mercy letters to creditors, consult ‚Äúpersonal attorneys,‚Äù and barter w/landlords over rent. Americans‚Äô lives are being upended by Trump‚Äôs temper tantrum. This is a disgrace. https://t.co/Ds7T78uIVr As the heartbreaking #ShutdownStories accounts make clear, the #TrumpShutdown is doing terrible damage to American families and small businesses. This is not a game and Americans are suffering bc of Donald Trump's temper tantrum. It must end.

https://t.co/dkJYslFJAs Before the #TrumpShutdown, we were able to pass some critical legislation, incl our landmark funding for traumatic brain injury research and an extension of the flood insurance program. We will push for long-term reforms in 2019.

https://t.co/NuWnWEXJGK From #PatersonNJ, my family and I wish every one celebrating the holiday a warm, happy, healthy Christmas üéÑ. In a challenging world, we have so much to rejoice and be thankful for. #MerryChristmas #HappyHolidaysToAll https://t.co/HAmZf3Nw0W On the eve before Christmas, the leader of our nation is raging incoherently about a shutdown he created. The #TrumpShutdown is destabilizing our economy and leaving hundreds of thousands of workers and their families in peril. https://t.co/VsQtS4BmJS RT @BillPascrell: This needless shutdown is a Trump shutdown. Despite controlling all three branches of government, Republicans still are i‚Ä¶ This needless shutdown is a Trump shutdown. Despite controlling all three branches of government, Republicans still are incapable of governing. Donald Trump is throwing a child‚Äôs temper tantrum and Republicans prefer stroking his unhinged ego to running a country. https://t.co/ctsnAh0vSn We were proud to defeat Republicans‚Äô early Christmas present to private insurance companies, includ those who take advantage of our constituents. In the impending Dem House we will push for bipartisan, sustainable flood insurance reform. https://t.co/HCCgCWpZ5h The Acting AG‚Äôs refusal to recuse himself over supervision of the Mueller probe is a gigantic scandal. The willingness of lackies like Matt Whitaker to abet Trump‚Äôs bottomless corruption threatens every American. https://t.co/eOej3533xz While the Senate continues to wait on its shutdown vote, moseyed over there today to do an interview w/ @billritter7 on NJ getting its fair share in a new tax bill. Watch it this Sunday morning on @ABC7NY https://t.co/3hoPXCGFrf This new #GOPTaxScam is Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs all over again. They prop up their dead tax bill to make it look alive. That didn‚Äôt work ‚Äì this will not work! https://t.co/0M2GUsd64k Thank you @RepJoshG for your support in finally getting this program approved. It will make a world of difference for so many TBI victims. https://t.co/cNY0C5T2hT .@RepRichardNeal‚Äôs assumption of this important job will mean more focus on fair tax policies, working families, and real oversight. I look forward to working beside him in 2019. Congratulations Richie! https://t.co/TTEA1FHvvV I‚Äôm ecstatic for @FrankPallone‚Äôs elevation to this critical post. Frank will be one of our top champions for affordable health care, consumer protections, and the fight against climate change. Congratulations Frank! https://t.co/DHLml0nXNa Traumatic brain injuries are some of the most calamitous one can endure. Our legislation will provide critical funding for breakthrough research across the country. With its final passage tonight, better treatments &amp; potential cures are closer than ever. https://t.co/hM7tllKkKM Our interest in oversight is not a way to embarrass Donald Trump. He does a good job at that himself. https://t.co/BDSADCZERe Since Feb. 2017, @HouseGOP has rejected 18 attempts to make public Trump's tax returns -- something he falsely promised to do himself. Subjecting the returns to proper oversight is critical &amp; a top priority in the next Congress.  #CongressMustRequest https://t.co/QME6uGCpGa https://t.co/ofJodvnTmy The Trump White House is making more outrageous assertions about the renegotiated NAFTA, claiming it will force Mexico to pay for Trump‚Äôs wall. This is a complete lie and has no basis in fact. The @NYT has also debunked this nonsense. https://t.co/VScqvRiigF https://t.co/eOrUDLaETr Happy 231st birthday to the great state of New Jersey. This terrific map from 1777 was when it was a province, commonly called the east and west Jerseys! Explore @LibraryCongress's incredible NJ collection https://t.co/1tpOs67oIM https://t.co/7pNrwllhI0 Analyzing the #TrumpTaxReturns will be one of Congress‚Äôs top priorities in 2019. Finally.

https://t.co/zK9W6mSZvx Paterson‚Äôs favorite son will finally be given the recognition from the United States government he has long deserved. Larry Doby was a man of unshakable courage and incredible character. I can‚Äôt wait for Larry‚Äôs family to accept the Medal in the Capitol Rotunda next year. https://t.co/xdVcCw0UTE The dishonesty and chaos of the Trump admin threaten our chance to rebalance our trade policies. Check out my op-ed on how the new Congress will work to provide needed change for American workers and small businesses.

https://t.co/Dq0YRmDlh9 The looting of great American companies like @Sears and @ToysRUs to fund executive bonuses is an outrage. Will the workers these same Sears execs fired be given any severance? https://t.co/3Rag7MhSIu NJ commuters need to feel safe on our rails. I was proud to work w/my colleagues to secure a $10M grant for Positive Train Control installation and I commend @GovMurphy for getting NJ Transit back on track. https://t.co/VhvKl5MIvq A copy of our letter seeking information from the Saudis about their actions at Trump Hotel is available here. https://t.co/MucQLmZ0UN A recent investigation found that the Saudi govt deceived veterans to further enrich Donald Trump through his hotel. Happy to join @tedlieu and 10 of my colleagues to demand answers from @SaudiEmbassyUSA. https://t.co/T8TFPdT1cc As a dissident facing religious persecution, Gulen does not deserve to be a pawn in Trump‚Äôs attempts to cover up the murder of a US resident for the Saudi royal family. Political dissidents deserve America‚Äôs protections, not be subject to Trump‚Äôs duplicitous schemes. https://t.co/JW2abJsD3G Zinke‚Äôs corruption made Teapot Dome look small. Good riddance. https://t.co/5qgheBQqDD On a Friday night before Christmas, a right wing activist judge is trying to throw tens of millions off of their health care. This preposterous decision invalidating the ACA must not stand. https://t.co/1uhTGH9PRq After two years of total dereliction by @HouseGOP, the incoming Congress will be dedicated to finally exercising oversight on #TrumpCorruption. https://t.co/5BIif10hN2 Our children shouldn‚Äôt be afraid in their classes. Parents shouldn‚Äôt fear sending their kids to school. On the 6th anniversary of #SandyHook, we won‚Äôt forget those who have lost their lives. Congress must act to end gun violence. #EnoughIsEnough Shame on us and shame on Donald Trump. These cruel policies must come to an end. https://t.co/MDjGYahvD0 Thank you @NancyPelosi for your leadership. We will not rest until Donald Trump‚Äôs personal and business records are given total scrutiny. We must see how far the crimes go. https://t.co/hNcfXDyiTD I was proud to support this resolution standing with Ukraine against Russian aggression. Russia must be held to account for its violations of Ukrainian sovereignty. https://t.co/0bHz2pG92G One last group photo our great @WaysMeansCmte members. We‚Äôre especially going to miss retiring @repsandylevin and @repjoecrowley. https://t.co/xADs92PfgJ The Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act will implement a critical CDC study on #TBI while furthering valuable research &amp; treatment programs across the country. As co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, I'm committed to getting this bill signed into law. https://t.co/KCiNsF25Bh We know, but thanks for making this crystal clear. No one is cheering for a  #TrumpShutdown but you. https://t.co/yjHxvei1mB .@HouseGOP has spent years cutting IRS staff to make it easier for corporations and the 1% to cheat on their taxes. Whose side do you think Republicans are on? https://t.co/FK11emdMSF I had the pleasure of interviewing my colleague of nearly 30 years, @RepLoBiondo as he retires from Congress. We covered his career, ways to make Congress work again, and more. 

Check out our full conversation here: https://t.co/xSZ1D8Hljl https://t.co/GtImPILn4q Our delegation had a terrific meeting with @GovMurphy and @LtGovOliver to discuss strengthening health care, building Gateway, and protecting the environment. NJ has a great team in place and we can‚Äôt wait to get started. https://t.co/G5v0BlTWCY For too long, Larry Doby‚Äôs courage and historical contributions have been overlooked. The Congressional Gold Medal will give Doby‚Äôs family and legacy more recognition for his heroism. https://t.co/axpDZxKldf Trump‚Äôs Postal Service task force would attack the rights of unionized employees, harm rural communities, and threaten the guarantee of universal service. Trump‚Äôs admin doesn‚Äôt want to protect our cherished USPS, but actively harm it. https://t.co/IaZ7wnK7BF After 77 years, December 7, 1941 remains a date that lives in infamy. We mark this day to remember our fallen so we never forget their sacrifice. #PearlHarborDay https://t.co/MQFcCHqeQc The Capitol Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony is always one of the highlights of the season! This year‚Äôs üå≤ comes all the way from Oregon! https://t.co/muilqhTb1g Today I joined most of the NJ delegation in condemning the Trump admin for allowing seismic exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. Drilling for oil and gas at the expense of our environment must stop. https://t.co/jFk2VuI8GP This is good news. New Jersey has taken a lead under @GovMurphy in passing strong, common sense gun control measures. We need more of them. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/yuq0qSDqrn Just 10 days left to #GetCovered in the open enrollment window and find a plan that works for you and your family.
