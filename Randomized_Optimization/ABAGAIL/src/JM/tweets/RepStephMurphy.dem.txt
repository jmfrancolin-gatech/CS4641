Wishing you joy as you gather with family and friends to celebrate the Festival of Lights. https://t.co/IWv0gLQkO0 Although I wasn‚Äôt in Florida tonight, my heart was in Spectrum Stadium. Inspiring win by @UCF_Football to keep our undefeated streak alive, claiming back-to-back conference championships and again securing a spot in a New Year‚Äôs bowl. What a team &amp; a university! #ChargeOn #FL07 Grateful to the Reagan National Defense Forum for inviting me to speak on this distinguished panel about encouraging young people to enter public service. There are many ways to serve our country, and we must think creatively about how to recruit and retain the top talent. #RNDF https://t.co/WlXY09WQEj George H.W. Bush was the epitome of a statesman‚ÄîWW2 pilot, ambassador, CIA director, VP, and the 41st President. He was beloved by his family, exuded grace and integrity, and will be deeply missed by the nation he served so well. RIP, Mr. President. https://t.co/a16Xi35bSD Congrats to my friend @RepDerekKilmer on his election as @HouseNewDems Chair! Congrats to our new Vice-Chairs as well: @RepTerriSewell, @RepScottPeters, @RepAnnieKuster &amp; @RepDelBene. Such a solid slate of strong leaders to help pass pro-economic growth &amp; pro-innovation policies! Congrats to my good friend, @WhipHoyer - our new Majority Leader! He has supported me since day one &amp; it was my honor to second his nomination. He is a fighter for middle-class families and will be a strong, inclusive leader for our caucus &amp; in Congress. Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/NKwiv4405F As the 1st woman Speaker, @NancyPelosi has proven herself a force to be reckoned with &amp; willing to listen to the diverse voices that make our Caucus great. She's earned my vote for Speaker. No matter who has the gavel or who's in the White House, I will always put #FL07 first. 2/ Earlier this year, I joined the #ProblemSolvers Caucus in proposing a set of rules changes to make the House more transparent, bipartisan, and responsive to the American people. Today, we reached an agreement with @NancyPelosi on many of these rules changes. 1/ RT @orlandosentinel: Stephanie Murphy chosen to lead moderate Democratic 'Blue Dogs' https://t.co/KHJUN8oRRn https://t.co/jlqCRzaySs RT @WhipHoyer: I congratulate the incoming leadership of @HouseBlueDogs, including my friends Co-Chair for Administration @RepStephMurphy,‚Ä¶ RT @HouseBlueDogs: NEWS: We've inducted 7 members-elect to @HouseBlueDogs who are dedicated to fiscally responsibility, a strong national d‚Ä¶ Humbled my colleagues on @HouseBlueDogs unanimously elected me to lead our 24-member coalition.

Trade affects quality of life at home and our relationships abroad, so we need to ensure our policy is carefully-calibrated and strategic. #FlaPol https://t.co/wXKXIr9uFe I led a bipartisan delegation to the @iitsec conference in #Orlando, which shows the cutting-edge work the modeling, simulation &amp; training community is doing to confront defense &amp; domestic challenges.

I hope PR holds a simple yes-or-no vote on whether it wants to be a state, and I hope voters reaffirm they support statehood. U.S. citizens in PR deserve true equality. #FL07 The thoughts of Knight Nation, and of all college football fans, are with QB McKenzie Milton‚Äîteam leader &amp; class act. Wishing him a full recovery. Congrats to @UCF_Football on the win over USF &amp; undefeated regular season. Let's win AAC championship &amp; bowl game for #10. #ChargeOn BREAKING NEWS-&gt; Even @POTUS‚Äô own Admin finds that climate change poses a dire threat to our way of life, especially in Florida, which is on the front lines. We must act now. I‚Äôll fight to enact a bold &amp; effective bill into law next Congress. https://t.co/4fiNpoetb6 #FL07 #FlaPol In a new divided Congress, we have two paths: partisan gridlock or bipartisan consensus. The #ProblemSolvers Caucus last year proposed the #BreakTheGridlock rules reform package &amp; will continue to push for changes. It‚Äôs not about a particular person; it‚Äôs about fixing a process. On this #ThanksgivingDay, I'm so very grateful for my wonderful family and for the opportunity to serve you in Congress. I'm especially thankful to our men and women in uniform, our veterans, and our military families for their sacrifice in service to this great nation. #FL07 As someone who counseled startups in the private sector, I've seen the ingenuity, determination, and courage of our nation's entrepreneurs. Central FL is home to so many of these job creators. I'm proud to work in Congress so more of our innovators can succeed. #EntrepreneursDay https://t.co/WVivY5OCcA Too many transgender Americans live in fear of violence simply because of who they are.
