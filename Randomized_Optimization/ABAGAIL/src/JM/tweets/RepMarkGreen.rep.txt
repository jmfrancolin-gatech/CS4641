- Ocasio-Cortez's tax plan: $720 billion over 10 years
- Bernie’s tax plan: $315 billion over 10 years This is not about women’s health. If you’re supporting ending the life of a child after delivery, it’s murder.

It’s so simple. Why haven’t Democrats signed on? This monster capitalized on our unsecure border and made billions of dollars smuggling drugs and people into the United States for more than two decades.

During the third presidential debate, Trump denounced partial-birth abortion, explaining the process in stomach-churning detail. In her response, Hillary Clinton gave a ‘robotic, ghoulish response defending the practice.’ There is also an argument to be made, as many have, that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump due to her extreme position on abortion. The United States is only 1 in 7 countries worldwide that even allow abortions in the late term – 20 weeks or later. Joining us at the bottom of the 198 countries worldwide are notorious human rights offenders like China and North Korea. .@GovernorVA and @vademocrats position is way outside the mainstream. New polling released in Jan shows 63% of Americans would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. 92% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats want “significant restrictions” on abortion.

If that is the case, they do not deserve the American people’s vote. Democrats need to end their quixotic 2020 posturing and start doing their jobs immediately. A legislator’s job is to legislate, so let’s come to the table and work on a solution. We knew this would happen. The past year has shown us Democrats don't want to secure our border. They only care about one thing -- refusing the president a “win.” Then: ‘Open up the government, and we’ll negotiate’

Now: --&gt; https://t.co/PviOvkQDUx Killing a baby once born is infanticide. Plain and simple.

Schumer and Pelosi seem callous to the human suffering due to our unsecure border.

Instead of a concrete wall, he’s offered a cheaper, metal wall that would be just as effective. But it seems Democrats don’t want a deal; they don’t want border security. They want to resist. #SecureOurBorder #TrumpAddress 60k illegal and inadmissible aliens arrive at our southern border every month. Immigration courts can’t handle all of them – the backlog is nearly 800k cases. We need to send a message with and finish the wall on our southern border. #SecureOurBorder 90% of heroin in this country comes across our southern border.
