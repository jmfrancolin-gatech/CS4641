Children belong with their families, not in cages. Read more about our legislation to ensure children and their families have the resources they need: https://t.co/iqFECjYEIh At every turn, the Trump administration has put its hate-filled immigration agenda over the best interests of children. @SenKamalaHarris and I introduced our legislation to ensure that kids have the support and care they deserve. A great piece by the @latimes about @brendatracy24 – an inspiration to me &amp; so many others for her courage and commitment to #SetTheExpectation https://t.co/oybkstmb61 The most ambitious crossover event in history. @ChrisEvans #captainamerica https://t.co/yeZkAZFWnA The federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong - plain and simple. Too many lives have been wasted and too many economic opportunities have been missed. It’s time for Congress to respect the will of the voters in Oregon and nationwide, who are demanding common-sense drug policies. NEW: I introduced S.420, my bill to legalize and responsibly regulate and tax marijuana. It’s time to bring our country’s marijuana policies into the 21st century, and my legislation is the way to do it. https://t.co/l5wKIWeZwV Nancy &amp; I are thinking of @RepDebDingell &amp; are so grateful for our long friendship. No one in public life did more to stress the importance of vigorous Congressional oversight than @JohnDingell, the importance of which has been shown repeatedly in just the last few days. https://t.co/mVcIj5w6DR I’m blowing the whistle today: Millions of Americans could face the threat of a big surprise tax bill this spring because of the Trump administration and the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/kY6s5OCJhJ It’s year one under Trump’s #GOPTaxScam, and filing season is open. Let’s check in on how it’s going.

(Spoiler alert: Not well.) https://t.co/Y28AWnmPVl #NetNeutrality means that once you pay your internet bill, you get to go where you want, how you want online. This bill lets Big Cable create one internet for those who can afford it, while American consumers are left with something worse. Republicans are selling fake #NetNeutrality. Accept no substitutes for the Open Internet. https://t.co/2wGiAYkQFM America needs to kick its carbon habit. As Ranking Member of @SenateFinance, I will make it a priority to throw the dirty tax relics of yesteryear into the garbage can and put clean energy front and center for a healthier future for every American. #GreenNewDeal Today I’m standing with @RepAOC and @SenMarkey to lay out our priorities for a #GreenNewDeal.

It’s time for Congress to get serious about tackling climate change and creating more good-paying, sustainable green jobs. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/5hlAEqT7BI Republicans’ health agenda amounts to slashing critical coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will not let them get away with weakening core protections while lining the pockets of Big Pharma and Insurance CEOs. https://t.co/vHCaKJMJa1 Lots to celebrate this #NGWSD in Oregon where @OregonWBB &amp; @BeaverWBB lead the Pac-12 – one of many outstanding examples in our state of women excelling in sports. #GoDucks #GoBeavs Listen to @RepCummings. The right to vote is the essence of our democracy. It's up to us to defend it. https://t.co/mesAyiQOBJ This is more than an oversight. It’s flagrant, willful disregard for the safety and security of Americans. Meanwhile, instead of policing these carriers, @FCC and @AjitPaiFCC have been rewriting the rules to help phone companies rake in more profit. This scandal keeps getting worse. Carriers assured customers location tracking abuses were isolated incidents. New evidence shows that hundreds of people could track our phones, and they were doing it for years before anyone at the wireless companies took action. https://t.co/I6ITUBYgeH Read more about my legislation here: https://t.co/ImQCRlBu8f When it comes to wine, craft beer, cider and spirits, Oregon does it best. It's time to level the playing field for craft beverage makers. I’m introducing my bill to allow these small businesses to continue to grow and create good jobs in Oregon. https://t.co/3Uv7KNccck Let's be clear on how cruel this is. The Trump administration didn't have to do this. It’s going out of its way to wipe out consumer protections and enable the worst abuses by financial predators.

Working people will suffer because of this. https://t.co/zRF074za1R I have the only bill in Congress that will take the necessary steps to safeguard our elections by mandating #PaperBallots for all elections &amp; implementing rigorous audits to ensure every American’s vote is counted. It’s time to secure America’s elections. https://t.co/FstCcU02ur .@staceyabrams I couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s time for Congress to get serious about protecting our democracy and fighting voter suppression. #AbramsAddress https://t.co/aKWJ1yM4OF My full statement on the #SOTU: https://t.co/lPOs60ZS6H Wishing a happy Lunar New Year to those celebrating in Oregon and around the world! #YearOfThePig .@SecPompeo do your job. Hold the Saudi government accountable for helping violent fugitives escape justice in the United States. https://t.co/KNpx97r0d1 Republicans are denying voters what they chose at the polls: better health care.

It’s no wonder Americans are fed up with our broken health care system. https://t.co/l7qEjwq3Q4 We have invited @abbvie, @AstraZeneca, @bmsnews, @JNJCares, @Merck, @pfizer, and @sanofi to testify before @SenateFinance. They will come before the committee one way or another. Last week, pharma execs refused to face members of @SenateFinance to justify the skyrocketing cost of their prescription drugs. Enough is enough. @ChuckGrassley and I are calling on companies to provide answers to the American people. https://t.co/TJp2vEzyG7 The Saudi government is torturing women’s rights activists on their own soil. Meanwhile, they're protecting accused rapists and killers from facing justice in the United States. This is abhorrent. https://t.co/CAchglnIBy Just in case it wasn’t clear, Bernhardt has no place serving as the trustee of our most precious natural resources. https://t.co/rciHT9qsUE David Bernhardt checks all the boxes for another corrupt Trump cabinet nominee:
✅Former oil lobbyist
✅Undermining environmental protections to benefit corporate polluters
✅Had a front row seat to scandals at Bush's and Trump’s Interior Departments Imagine if you put the same effort into reuniting children ripped away from their parents. https://t.co/DtT0EnCe6U Thanks to my Senate colleagues @SenBlumenthal and @ChuckGrassley who continue to fight for transparency on on this issue through their work on @senjudiciary. ICYMI: https://t.co/fa6ixlqbKD Trump's attempts to discredit and limit the #MuellerInvestigation make it clear he's terrified of the details being made public. Two weeks ago, I said I'd fight to ensure the report is available to be seen by the American people. That is now more critical than ever. https://t.co/lptLRazyu6 Read more about my bill to enhance election security and implement paper ballots for all elections: https://t.co/FstCcU02ur .@staceyabrams @fairfightaction I couldn’t agree more. It’s time to secure our elections and make paper ballots the law of the land. And I have the bill to do it. #FairElectionsNow https://t.co/8XLj7aBEbx Thrilled to hear these books from @librarycongress will make their way to students and folks in Umatilla looking to promote learning and broaden horizons. I look forward to sending more in the future! https://t.co/aHg84ngQVU It’s time for lawmakers to hold @DeptofDefense accountable for wasting taxpayer dollars. Today, I’m joining my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to call for a timely audit of the #DoD to shed light on how these funds are being used. https://t.co/qHgOH5WGZI .@SenSchumer, @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I are calling on the Trump administration to tackle China's trade cheating and not settle for a weak deal that shortchanges American workers. https://t.co/Gg9CoWXXYw Let me be clear: I will hold the Saudi government accountable for subverting the rule of law in the United States. America is learning what Oregonians already know: there is growing evidence that Saudi Arabia is aiding and abetting Saudi nationals who are committing violent crimes on American soil, and abusing modern diplomatic privileges. https://t.co/VOZpNfseeF It is deeply troubling that individuals closely associated with the Trump campaign appear to have used shady, likely illegal tactics to undermine #NetNeutrality and to deprive Americans of internet freedom. https://t.co/no82NuOKGo But I have deep concerns about Trump’s knee-jerk, politically-motivated plan. If done too quickly or with political rather than strategic goals in mind, withdrawing from the Middle East could pose a significant threat to U.S. national security. The safe withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East must be a priority for Congress. @senatemajldr’s proposal puts us on a path to endless presence of American troops, leaving them in harm’s way. Last year, the Senate voted on a bipartisan basis to throw out Trump’s #DarkMoney rule. I hope this time around, Senate Republicans will support this legislation to increase transparency in our elections &amp; take our democracy back from over powerful insiders &amp; foreign meddlers. In a gift to foreign meddlers and special interests, the Trump administration has turned a blind eye to illegal campaign spending in America. @SenatorTester and I are fighting back with legislation that would shine a light on #DarkMoney. https://t.co/spdMuVMlWC I’m calling on @Interior and @USDA to distribute federal funds for schools and infrastructure projects that were delayed during the #TrumpShutdown, leaving rural communities in Oregon and across the country hamstrung. https://t.co/3wvCFFuZQQ I grew up witnessing the gender pay gap firsthand. My mother was a librarian, and despite working just as hard as her male colleagues, she never earned the same paycheck. I will keep fighting to ensure that women aren’t cheated out of the resources they need for their futures. It's outrageous that today, many women are not earning equal pay for equal work. When women succeed in the workplace, everyone benefits. I'm cosponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act to guarantee that women are able to hold their employers accountable if they don't earn #EqualPay. Any claims that the NRA played no official role in the 2015 Moscow trip are not credible. https://t.co/qu8YYdtN7b At today’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, I pressed FBI Director Wray about whether he will further examine evidence showing that the Saudi government has helped Saudi nationals accused of serious crimes flee the country, including my home state of Oregon. https://t.co/zb89ytVzvn Exactly why I said last Friday that I’m going to pull out all the stops to make sure the Mueller report gets to the American people. https://t.co/iS8MQmsnVS Great meeting with @OSBANews today to discuss the importance of funding key education programs, investing in our rural schools &amp; innovative ways to increase graduation rates across the state of Oregon. I will continue fighting Republican attempts to slash these vital resources. https://t.co/a4DNWwbYSy ICYMI: With the decision in #SouthCarolina last week, the Trump administration made it clear it would rather green light discrimination over the best interests of vulnerable kids. I will continue fighting this immoral policy. https://t.co/P5XzjYseEz Make no mistake: I will continue fighting to pass legislation to ensure that Americans and their families are able to access the life-saving medications they need. Pharma companies claim they want to make their products affordable for everyone, but they couldn’t be bothered to show up today to discuss how we can make that a reality. Today’s hearing is just the beginning, as the @SenateFinance committee tackles rising drug costs. This morning @SenateFinance held a hearing to address skyrocketing prescription drug prices, but not a single one of the largest drug companies were willing to testify. In 1994, even the Big Tobacco CEOs were willing to come to Congress and testify. https://t.co/5iv8FiKqVb The #TrumpShutdown created regulatory paralysis for craft beverage producers across Oregon. @repblumenauer &amp; I are calling on federal regulators to work through their backlog of paperwork to help small businesses left hamstrung by Trump’s political games. https://t.co/IBcyO7LHjI What's worse is that after blowing a $2 trillion hole in the budget, Republicans are saying there isn’t enough money for critical programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and infrastructure. https://t.co/apWmRSE3mO Turns out the #GOPTaxScam was, in fact, a scam. https://t.co/kTYu0nuinY |￣￣￣￣￣￣|

#DataPrivacyDay Today is #DataPrivacyDay. I will continue pushing my colleagues in Congress to step up and take action to put real protections in place to secure Americans’ private data. In fact, I have the bill to do it: https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX I’m demanding that the Trump administration immediately provide back pay to the federal workers hurt by the #TrumpShutdown, who were forced to go without pay for over a month thanks to Trump’s temper tantrum. https://t.co/spQ1m4EvuK On this #HolocaustRemembranceDay, I’m reflecting on the consequences of failing to stand up to prejudice and hate. As the son of parents who fled Nazi Germany, I will continue fighting to ensure that America remains a place where all are welcome, and all are equal. I joined @allinwithchris to discuss how I will lead the fight in the Senate to ensure that the Mueller report is made public. https://t.co/ziTgFRzmS5 You forced hundreds of thousands of families to go without paychecks and access to vital government services. You made millions of Americans suffer to help Trump secure a racist talking point. https://t.co/5cVfGCZu49 This one is disgusting, even for Big Coal execs:
   
First the coal companies inflicted horrific black lung disease on a growing number of the miners, then they used their lobbying power to slash their contribution to the miners’ health care. https://t.co/x1Xe3g6Byc The bills @SenJeffMerkley and I introduced will force the Justice Department to get to the bottom of what happened, and create tough consequences for any government that helps flout the U.S. justice system: https://t.co/TnYLXYLlSl More than a month after the @Oregonian spotlighted how Saudi Arabia’s government apparently helped accused criminals flee the U.S, the Trump Administration has failed to explain what, if anything, it’s doing to ensure these men face U.S. justice:  https://t.co/uis2pTSUH3 Ending the #TrumpShutdown means relief for the thousands of federal workers who are struggling to put food on the table, and the taxpayers who rely on the vital work they do. Wasting $5 billion on a border wall is a bad idea today, and will be a bad idea three weeks from now. One more Oregon casualty of this month-long &amp; senseless #TrumpShutdown is damage to job-creating start-up businesses like this one in Portland: https://t.co/m8ywKiGiVr This witch hunt sure has turned up a lot of witches. https://t.co/0wGxVQ5Wlz Make it happen today: open the government @senatemajldr. More than two weeks after this #RonReport from my #2019townhall in Clatsop County, the continuing #TrumpShutdown is causing even more pain in Astoria: https://t.co/wFV1BMsmyb https://t.co/ub4AQbgMrm When I had my #2019townhall this month in Tillamook County, I heard a lot of concern about the #TrumpShutdown on the @USCGPacificNW &amp; other federal workers. Here’s unfortunate but unsurprising new evidence of the shutdown’s impact there: https://t.co/8Jd1CNguvP The damage from this #TrumpShutdown on Oregon’s businesses and the jobs they create throughout our state is undeniable: https://t.co/AdGi0scNpA .@senatemajldr open the government. American families are struggling to afford life-saving medications like EpiPens while drug makers game the system to profit off of taxpayers. Today @ChuckGrassley and I are introducing legislation to hold drug makers accountable when they cheat taxpayers. https://t.co/PZWJrsskXR It’s time for Congress and the federal government to step up and implement protections for Americans’ private data. My bill will create real transparency and accountability for tech giants and their executives who fail to protect your privacy. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX Thanks to @SenSchumer, @SenatorLeahy, @SenMarkey, @SenBlumenthal, @SenKamalaHarris, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenatorCardin, @SenWhitehouse, @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenGillibrand, @SenBooker, @SenJackReed, @SenTinaSmith, and @SenSanders for supporting these efforts to increase transparency. Today I’m calling on @FCC and @FTC to investigate how wireless carriers sold Americans’ private location data to shady middlemen. It’s clear that carriers are failing to protect their customers’ information from misuse and abuse by third parties. https://t.co/wOVJbRpEQ1 The decision by the Trump administration to allow for taxpayer-funded discrimination is an affront to American values, jeopardizing the safety and protection of vulnerable children in foster care across South Carolina, and potentially the country. https://t.co/OZPGpWUmyh Trump isn’t offering a compromise. He’s adding to his list of demands.
 
The Trump/McConnell bill would gut DACA &amp; put harsh restrictions on those seeking safety &amp; asylum in America.
 
Thirty-three days into the #TrumpShutdown, this is a big step backward. Trump's shameful and racist immigration proposal will recreate the wall of paper against asylum seekers like the one used to exclude Jews from coming to America on the eve of the Holocaust. https://t.co/GIj1FBXxqK What a surprise, the shady middlemen who profit off your data also lobbied the @FCC to hide what they do with your information. And share it without permission. Enough is enough. Pass 👏 my👏 privacy👏 bill👏 https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX https://t.co/31iMdVVjmr All town halls will be rescheduled. New dates and times will be announced. Check back here for more information: https://t.co/3cGcudtkia Given the news that @senatemajldr is forcing a vote on the president’s partisan immigration proposal, my #2019townhalls between January 23 and January 26 in Deschutes, Jefferson, Crook, Multnomah, Josephine, and Jackson counties have been postponed. Great conversation with @BMakuch about how wireless carriers sold out American's safety and privacy, and the need for Congress to get serious and take action to defend private data. https://t.co/iHaVPg3SK4 Today at Hood River Distillers, I heard directly from Gorge leaders and workers in the craft beverage industry about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting their growing small businesses. https://t.co/aJOe3UnMbG Great Wasco County #2019TownHall discussion this morning about renewable energy, #TrumpShutdown, Mueller investigation and gun violence. #ListeningToTheFuture at Dufur School https://t.co/IGsLfYmbjg ICYMI: https://t.co/InZ7IurRgp ICYMI: https://t.co/aUcwGTpmeA Given the clear pattern of self-serving deals that exclusively benefit members of the Trump family, it’s hard to believe that Trump is striking the best trade deal when China keeps paying off his family. https://t.co/7J5usTkhtl Great to experience @Google’s Rolling Study Hall program today at Dufur School, which helps rural students with long commutes access WiFi and provides them more learning time on their school bus. https://t.co/qanx0JhOch Trump's discriminatory ban is an affront to the brave soldiers who could see their rights taken away, rights they risked their lives fighting to defend. It is appalling, but not surprising, that Trump's SCOTUS is allowing this injustice to move forward at all. https://t.co/Wga2iDNsxO The conversation at yesterday’s #2019townhall in Hood River displayed the #OregonWay at its best — great questions about climate change, healthcare, public lands, gun violence &amp; concerns over the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/6TK1Fvhiot .@CBP failed to answer pressing questions about the fate of children &amp; their families separated at the border. It did, however, confirm the cruelty of this policy &amp; the Trump administration’s assault on American values &amp; decency. https://t.co/S8hFJjfsox I first met Eva Jones at my town hall last year in Hood River County when she spoke about gun violence. Today, I sat down in Hood River with Eva &amp; her @GirlUp classmates to hear all they’re working on for women’s health &amp; gun violence. The future is very bright in their hands. https://t.co/mpaXcJayWc Important discussion at last night’s #2019townhall in Clackamas County on the #TrumpShutdown, the need to protect Oregon’s salmon and our public lands among the many topics covered. Thank you to @clackamascounty Commissioners Fischer and Humberston for joining me! https://t.co/lbG1w2t1Pd Enjoyed catching up with so many friends this morning in Portland at the annual #Skbreakfast. Thanks as always to the @TheSkannerNews for organizing this annual #MLKDay event &amp; providing the stage to share Dr. King’s message of equal opportunity for all. https://t.co/EOVfymf3AX Heard lots of concern at today’s #2019townhall in Polk County about the destructive #TrumpShutdown impact on Oregonians and the need for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr to end it. https://t.co/F1REwK8avp What a great honor this morning in Salem — thank you to Gayle Goschie and @OregonHops for awarding me with their first ever Hop Warrior Award! Proud to work with all of you to grow this crop to even greater economic heights. https://t.co/yWaBkSI61c Great #2019townhall yesterday at @lbcc in Albany with a real #OregonWay conversation covering health care, infrastructure, climate change, the broken campaign finance system &amp; more. Thanks very much, Linn County. https://t.co/odypXxVjG3 The only thing we learned from Trump's announcement is that in addition to holding 800,000 federal workers hostage, he's now using thousands of Dreamers and immigrant families as bargaining chips to fulfill a campaign promise and waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall. Heard this afternoon in Springfield how @foodforlc &amp; @CCSofLaneCounty are working hard during the monthlong and senseless #TrumpShutdown to help furloughed federal workers and their families keep food on the table. https://t.co/UC4crscqjJ Incredible energy at today’s Womxn’s March in Eugene shows how the power of real political change starts at the grass roots. https://t.co/pWNF6J21xo Huge kudos to @OregonWBB for providing tickets last night to federal workers furloughed by the #TrumpShutdown. And kudos as well for last night’s hard-fought win at @MattArena. #GoDucks https://t.co/wHib3oYET6 Lots of good questions at today’s Benton County #2019townhall about the #TrumpShutdown as well as gun violence, college costs, climate change &amp; mental health. Thanks Monroe HS tor hosting. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/EASInPoJvz Glad to have helped this Oregonian solve the problems caused by the #TrumpShutdown &amp; get the health care she needs to survive. But she is not the only one impacted. Millions of Americans are struggling to cope with from the consequences of this shutdown. https://t.co/y7Mr22LFGb Incredible. More luxury travel from the Trump administration.

What kind of signal does this send to the tens of thousands of Treasury employees under @stevenmnuchin1 who are going without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown? https://t.co/k4XHqfbho9 Started Day #28 of this #TrumpShutdown at the @oregonfoodbank in PDX w/ @repblumenauer &amp; @RepBonamici. The shutdown pain isn’t making America great - it’s making America wait for @realDonaldTrump to come to his senses and end his shutdown now. https://t.co/Bgmbp9L5ux .@repblumenauer and I met in Portland today with @OregonAFLCIO, @TheIronworkers &amp; @AFGENational who are distributing food boxes to furloughed federal workers because of this #TrumpShutdown. One more needless and cruel consequence of this shutdown. #StopTheShutdown https://t.co/j3Zs5fjKHU I have some questions for @TMobile. https://t.co/pUL1vaYAVN It’s no wonder Americans are so fed up with America’s health care system when the Trump administration continues its campaign of sabotage while families pick up the check. https://t.co/UF4SuF6Uvx Thousands more children were ripped away from their families than originally disclosed to the public. It’s unacceptable that the Trump administration failed to keep track of these children. I’m demanding answers. https://t.co/54CMIlOxbf Today, Senate Republicans are pushing a bill to deny women the right to get the health care they need. Ending the government shutdown should be our top priority, not another partisan attack on women’s health care. #RonReport https://t.co/2AyJsBufav My bill will create real transparency and hold companies accountable when they misuse and abuse their customer’s information. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX .@tim_cook I couldn’t agree more. It’s time for Congress to get serious about protecting consumer data and privacy. https://t.co/QIYVjrHHzi .@OIGatHHS says family separations at the border increased months before Trump's "zero tolerance" policy. That means THOUSANDS more kids were ripped away from their families than originally reported. This administration's cruelty knows no bounds. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/m55RNuSRoN Thank you @ToolJasmine for sharing your story. Your courageous cancer battle should not be made even harder by this needless and cruel #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/bwZGnXDkyX This situation cannot continue. The Senate passed a bipartisan government funding bill just weeks ago. The House passed it earlier this month. The pathway out of this shutdown is right in front of us, in plain view. @senatemajldr must bring this legislation to the floor. Without insurance, Jasmine’s home health assistant can’t continue to help her. That means that within days, she won’t be able to get the infusions that are keeping her alive, and she could starve. Then comes the government shutdown. Just a few weeks ago, Jasmine was informed that her health insurance had lapsed, and only her employer could fix it. But because Jasmine works for the federal government, her employer is shut down. Nobody’s answering the phones. For years, Jasmine has been living with an inoperable brain tumor, relying on invaluable care by a home health worker to access nutritional assistance. You would not wish Jasmine’s struggle on your worst enemy, but she is confronting it with remarkable bravery. I went to the Senate floor to share the story of Jasmine, a 30 year old mother of two from Southern Oregon. Millions of Americans are feeling the impacts of the #TrumpShutdown, but Jasmine is bearing its most unthinkable consequences. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/B14uYZbuzy I’m heading to the Senate floor to share the heartbreaking story of an Oregonian who is bearing the most unthinkable consequences of the #TrumpShutdown. #ShutdownStories Tune in here: https://t.co/U0hbP1UgAG I am LIVE. Head to @wydenpress for live updates from my staff. https://t.co/rLukeTlfuB I'm heading to the Senate floor to speak against William Barr’s nomination to serve as Attorney General. His views on privacy &amp; surveillance are a recipe for more abuses – any member who wants to protect the Fourth Amendment should be worried. Tune in: https://t.co/ylmct0Xukk $5,000 might not mean much to Trump and his rich cronies, but to federal workers, the #TrumpShutdown means missed rent checks, unpaid medical bills, and going without food on the table. https://t.co/ykZZZD8vXQ Unpaid @USCGPacificNW workers in Oregon needing food donations for their families because of this shameful #TrumpShutdown? This shutdown is cruel &amp; senseless. End it, @senatemajldr &amp; @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/aTwV8Y7aMp RT @SenateDems: A federal judge in Texas recently ruled the entire ACA unconstitutional.

The @SenateDems will push Republicans to vote on… Thank you @RepDannyDavis for joining me in the fight to ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to work and climb the economic ladder. https://t.co/ILyJ1Rr7oX Over half of IRS’s employees are being called back to work without pay, and the agency still can’t tell me whether refunds will be delayed. This is unacceptable, and an insult to every American taxpayer and furloughed worker. https://t.co/x1YY8jgDm3 https://t.co/L5yqkCoVzo A sad commentary on Day #25 of this #TrumpShutdown that hard-working @USCGPacificNW employees need a food pantry in Astoria because @senatemajldr &amp; @realdonaldtrump won’t re-open the government &amp; pay them: https://t.co/SbeBcKZwqJ The #ELEVATEAct takes a critical first step in building economic security for America’s 21st century workforce and its needs. https://t.co/VAEr1CHZUU By providing a fresh approach to job training &amp; economic opportunity, the #ELEVATEAct cuts bureaucratic red tape in order to connect Americans looking for jobs with employers looking to fill open positions. American workers need access to affordable child care, health care and transportation. The #ELEVATEAct will help more Americans get the support they need so they can access jobs and training, and provide for their families. Too many Americans are being left behind in today’s economy. I’m introducing the #ELEVATEAct to end the era of “train and pray” and put those struggling to find work on the fast track to a stable income and good-paying careers. https://t.co/SARC3c5HOU Trump is unable to fund the government, but is sending Steve Mnuchin and Mike Pompeo to hobnob with global elites and the ultrarich in #Davos. Meanwhile, their own employees are missing paychecks and unable to put food on the table. Here's what's at stake if the Republicans succeed in their campaign of sabotage against the #AffordableCareAct: millions of seniors will pay more for prescription drugs, coverage for pre-existing conditions will be slashed &amp; low-cost preventative care will be a thing of the past. .@senatemajldr and his Republican colleagues claim to support coverage for pre-existing conditions. Today, we’re offering a Senate resolution to give Republicans a chance to prove it. Mitch McConnell should put it to a vote. Just a few weeks ago, a Texas judge handed down one of the most absurd rulings of the 21st century, dealing a massive blow to the #AffordableCareAct, endangering health care rights and shredding the social safety net. https://t.co/CTzUXX4030 We are live NOW: https://t.co/HX4RLhh8br I will be speaking live soon with my Senate Democratic Colleagues to discuss our resolution to condemn threats to the #AffordableCareAct. Tune in HERE: https://t.co/tKXvGIG3Z8 Saudi Arabia is protecting its citizens from facing real legal repercussions for violent crimes committed on American soil. It’s time for the Saudi regime to be held accountable for subverting the rule of law in the United States. https://t.co/xhQNHowNvq .@SecPompeo missed a key opportunity to raise concerns about human rights in Bahrain during his meetings last week. He should support the people of Bahrain who continue to shed light on the Bahraini regime’s imprisonment of human rights activists and political opponents. I’ve got the bill to do just that:  https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX Thanks to @FrankPallone for taking this critical first step towards creating real transparency and oversight of wireless carriers that misuse Americans' data. Next, we need strong legislation to protect consumers against companies that abuse our privacy. https://t.co/7zZ4V70v4K Memo to @realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr: this #TrumpShutdown is causing real concern for domestic violence shelters in Oregon &amp; nationwide. Read this, then tell me how this shutdown isn’t hurting our country: https://t.co/BYAauvfgcY Lots of concern at the Oregon Brewers Guild’s meeting this week in PDX from @WidmerBrothers, @BreaksideBrews &amp; @CaptainNeon &amp; other craft brewers about the #TrumpShutdown damage to their sales &amp; jobs. End your shutdown @realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr https://t.co/YEHjQ8ffOE The disdain for working people is astounding. https://t.co/c8dhzUPQ2m I’m asking @USTreasury and @IRSnews how they’re planning to protect taxpayers from consequences of the #TrumpShutdown. Without IRS staff and resources available, American families could be waiting weeks or months for tax refunds to come through. https://t.co/iOZW9DGeFd The #TrumpShutdown is an insult to American taxpayers who will be left footing the bill for this costly temper tantrum. https://t.co/VX1Cd4citz This shutdown was wrong from the beginning. The president’s willingness to hurt workers in Oregon and around the country is appalling. It’s long past time for the #TrumpShutdown to end. https://t.co/05aOuwab9C Park rangers, food safety inspectors, airport security officers. The victims of this shutdown are hardworking people who don’t get to fall back on the Trump family safety net like the president has so many times before. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/9KrBEWBslU Correct, @senjeffmerkley. This shutdown is an insult to all those who are missing paychecks today. Trump is telling them that his wasteful, ineffective wall is more important than their income. They’re struggling to make ends meet so that he can fulfill a campaign talking point. https://t.co/lfyHEKC023 I agree with @Columbia1938. Make America’s Parks Open Again. @senatemajldr, shut down the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/moMj4xbXME Do you trust @ATT, @sprint, @verizon and @TMobile to protect your personal location information? For Oregonians needing food assistance because of the senselessly cruel #TrumpShutdown, there’s helpful information here from the @oregonfoodbank: https://t.co/HLHBSjvRAp Congress needs to pass strong legislation to protect Americans’ privacy and finally hold companies accountable when they put your safety at risk by letting stalkers and criminals track your phone on the dark web. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX Wireless carriers are promising, yet again, to stop sharing American’s location data without their consent. I’ll believe it when I see it. It’s not enough for these tech giants and their CEOs to lay blame for misuse and abuse of information on downstream companies. It’s time for Congress to get serious about protecting Americans’ privacy by passing my bill to create real, radical transparency around how your information is shared by companies. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX The facts speak for themselves: big tech companies cannot be trusted to hold themselves accountable when it comes to protecting consumer’s private data. https://t.co/HcalVO0Uv9 Failure to #ActOnClimate spells dire consequences for our economy, the health and safety of our families, and the future of our planet. Congress must take the first step towards a #GreenNewDeal by making sure the tax code meets America’s 21st century energy needs. Transforming the U.S. tax code to support an innovative, low-carbon economy and stop the promotion of extracting, importing and burning fossil fuels will mean:

✅ More clean energy jobs

✅ Lower electricity bills

✅ Cleaner air

✅  Securing the future of our planet Congress needs to kick the carbon habit. We need a #GreenNewDeal. It's time to throw away the 44 energy tax breaks anchored by advantages for big oil &amp; replace them with 3 streamlined credits: clean energy, clean transportation fuel &amp; energy efficiency. https://t.co/v9VCqzM0wC Americans demand that something be done to end gun violence. That’s why this week, I’m introducing legislation to expand background checks. This is a common sense, long-overdue step to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them. https://t.co/1WzuSdAFPu Thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, the @US_FDA is understaffed and unable to ensure the quality and safety of the food you and your family eat. What’s really putting the safety of Americans at risk is the president himself. https://t.co/ijmvqp9hzP Trump is using the American people like pawns in a political game, holding their livelihoods hostage – and McConnell is aiding and abetting. It’s time for @senatemajldr to bring legislation to the Senate floor that passed weeks ago to end the #TrumpShutdown. Democrats are for opening the government and securing the border. Trump is holding the country hostage over his failure to fulfill a campaign talking point. Trump, who ordered the government to split up migrant families and lock children in cages, now claims to be concerned about a humanitarian crisis at the border. Trump’s “border crisis” is one of his own making. His entire immigration agenda is based in racism and fearmongering. Read this as Trump attempts to sell his plan to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a campaign talking point. https://t.co/PJEzFNG8ds Without critical federal funding, the #TrumpShutdown may force domestic violence shelters to shutter their doors and end vital services for survivors, like counseling and legal help. https://t.co/Zl2OGKsd8U Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are entering their third week without pay. The #TrumpShutdown is forcing many of them to make tough choices between paying their bills and putting food on the table for their families. https://t.co/HRfRU3sdDw With limited Air Traffic Control and TSA agents, and airport lines getting longer, Trump is putting the safety of Americans and their loved ones traveling on the back burner during the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/KXafDG6vGa Without critical resources, our #NationalParks are overflowing with garbage &amp; waste, creating lasting impacts for years to come. These treasured resources will no longer be the same for future generations to enjoy thanks to the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/J78ys8G6FT Mothers and children will go hungry, unable to access nutrition assistance. Kids in schools will be denied free and reduced cost lunch, leaving them without healthy meals during the day. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/7Lod46q89k As the #TrumpShutdown drags on, low-income families could be evicted if they lose access to their housing vouchers, while the administration is turning away new applicants in need of affordable housing. https://t.co/1hqMr9XxBU Trump’s “border crisis” is a fraud, the wall is a wasteful and ineffective way to secure the border, and the only national emergency here is the damage Trump’s fragile ego is doing to the country. 🚨 Medicare will be the latest casualty of the #TrumpShutdown unless @senatemajldr lets the Senate vote to reopen the government and prevent millions of dollars in cuts to health care. 🚨 https://t.co/w1G0Xrt9r9 This information could be obtained by anyone: a stalker, an ex, or a child predator. It’s time for the @FCC to get its act together. https://t.co/98jP4OJeRX Major carriers pledged to end these practices, but it appears to have been more empty promises to consumers. It’s time for Congress to take action by passing my bill to safeguard consumer data and hold companies accountable. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX After I exposed these dangerous practices last year, several carriers, including @tmobile’s CEO @JohnLegere told me point blank that his company would stop selling customer location data to shady third parties. https://t.co/JSASCP2PWH NEW: Disturbing details from @motherboard on how wireless carriers are selling the location data of Americans. This is a nightmare for national security and the personal safety of anyone with a phone. https://t.co/2GN3LwarTM I agree with @ChrisVanHollen.
   
The #TrumpShutdown means hundreds of thousands of Americans are missing paychecks, so let’s not pretend it’s business as usual in the Senate. No other legislation should be considered until @senatemajldr allows a vote to re-open the government. https://t.co/Jn08t4NCFF Great questions from the @woodburnbdogs students &amp; all the Marion County community members who came to today’s #2019townhall at Woodburn HS. Topics included health care, education, homelessness, public lands, DACA &amp; ending this destructive #TrumpShutdown. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/xKombeG7ch I heard firsthand in Clatsop County at my #2019TownHall how the Coast Guard is too important on the Oregon Coast to get tossed around by this #TrumpShutdown on the seas of budget uncertainty. #RonReport from Astoria https://t.co/GfvHLArd7C Thanks Chris and Jack for having me over yesterday at @FortGeorgeBeer to talk about your business &amp; all the jobs you’re creating in Astoria &amp; Clatsop County. Your company is an outstanding example of our state’s trailblazing &amp; award-winning breweries. https://t.co/Y0Xmxg9Owa Lots of good questions in St..Helens at tonight’s Columbia County #2019townhall about the need to end the damaging #TrumpShutdown and to return the focus to education, veterans, climate change, health care &amp; other challenges facing our country. https://t.co/d4RfolyTF4 Heard at today’s #2019townhall in Astoria from Clatsop County about the community’s concerns over the senseless #TrumpShutdown impact on the @USCGPacificNW and much more. Thanks to all who attended this afternoon and to @CRMMAstoria for hosting. https://t.co/rkb04MEiGL It's time for Trump to stop playing games with Americans' livelihoods in order to pursue his racist immigration agenda. He must end the #TrumpShutdown immediately. The president is delusional if he thinks Americans are benefiting from the #TrumpShutdown. During my first round of #2019TownHalls this weekend, I heard from Oregonians about how they &amp; their loved ones have been impacted &amp; unable to access the critical services they need. https://t.co/LXtiEwVNYs Very much enjoyed catching up at yesterday’s #2019townhall in Lincoln City with Lincoln County Commissioner Claire Hall, a friend and true public servant.  Thanks as always, Claire for being a great townhall moderator. https://t.co/3mqaubsrVv Heard at this afternoon’s #2019townhall in Tillamook County from Oregonians who want this Trump shutdown to end. Good conversation about infrastructure, campaign finance, gun violence, health care, coastal economy and more. https://t.co/JmX8OGwVZT Thanks to everybody who came out on a rainy Saturday at the Oregon Coast for today’s #2019townhall in Lincoln City. Lincoln County showed up strong to share views on health care, homelessness, college costs, climate change, vote-by-mail &amp; the real-life impact of this shutdown. https://t.co/nm78jcGAXk One of the many devastating impacts of this unconscionable Trump shutdown is the senseless stoppage of essential training for wildlands firefighters and other crucial wildfire preparation: https://t.co/crEqAzc3tc It was my great honor at last night’s #2019townhall in Sherwood to present June Close with the medals her late husband Vernon Garner earned by making the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in WWII. https://t.co/eoQBQfuYvG Enjoyed last night’s #2019townhall very much in Washington County &amp; the #OregonWay community discussion in Sherwood about the needless government shutdown, health care, gun violence, wildfires &amp; more. https://t.co/uQz3KQt2bl
