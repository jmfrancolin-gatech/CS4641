We cannot thank them enough for everything they do. https://t.co/uBnAjkUeUo Wishing you all a Happy Fourth! We’re all thinking of those who will spend the day apart from their families, including our troops who are overseas defending our nation as well as the brave firefighters battling the fires across our state. God bless you and thank you. Click the link below to stay updated on the ongoing #SpringFire https://t.co/yXtidiQK2f We are all very thankful for the firefighters working around the clock to contain these fires. Plz follow their directions and do not fly drones over the fire areas as it forces incident commanders to suspend aerial firefighting efforts since drones can pose a risk to aircrafts. My office continues to track the fires burning in #CO03 including the Spring Fire, and is coordinating w/ federal, state and local officials to ensure resources are readily available to fight the fire. Plz call my Pueblo office at 719-542-1073 if we can be of assistance.
