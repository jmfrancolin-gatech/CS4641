https://t.co/AFBUJpkb19 We’re just a few days away from another potential government shutdown.

Black History Month is as good a time to start as any, but that's because it's always a good time. 6/6 In that 1876 speech, Douglass also wrestled at length with the complex balance of Lincoln's personal prejudices and the seeds of enlightenment along with the profound impact of Lincoln's public actions and their shortcomings. 5/6 https://t.co/xY1oQPRj1h Douglass said of Lincoln, "He was ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people of this country." 4/6 https://t.co/MYV7t129Y8 Douglass' "Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln" which he delivered on April 14, 1876 in Washington similarly touches on this balance of Lincoln's personal and public views on race and the complicated blending of the two 3/6
https://t.co/IpfWa3FT6q For example, Douglass' interactions with Lincoln over the role and treatment of black troops in the Civil War were revealing in his warm treatment of Douglass and sincere support for the regiments of black troops, but the limitations of that support 2/6 https://t.co/rC57zcl39T Frederick Douglass' writings on Lincoln are particularly fascinating in this regard because he addresses both aspects in Lincoln, a man he came to respect and love, who never went as far or as fast as Douglass wished but whose efforts he didn't diminish despite disappointment 1/6 https://t.co/PWxFlKsulX A very helpful, disturbing, thread from an expert on nuclear strategy, and the catastrophic dangers it presents.
