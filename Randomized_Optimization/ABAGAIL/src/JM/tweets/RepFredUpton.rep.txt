Finally, 21st Century Cures has played a pivotal role in addressing the #opioid epidemic by funding the fight at the state level – with more than $1 billion in grants to states in need. We're also making needed reforms to our mental health system &amp; at the FDA. We’re now able to get drugs and devices to the market more efficiently – helping to address drug prices.
