RT @PattyMurray: Primary care can play a critical role in reducing health costs and improving outcomes—but only if people have access to it… @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: When people don’t have access to primary care, patients go to the ER for non-urgent medical care, or worse, go without medical care entirely, until non-urgent issues become more expensive to treat, more debilitating, &amp; more challenging to overcome. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: While primary care providers can play a critical role in coordinating care and reducing costs, they can only play that role when people have access to care. In fact, lack of access can actually drive costs higher. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: The result [of the Patient Centered Medical Home model] is care that helps bring down costs not just by giving patients better, efficient care when they are ill, but also by doing more to keep them healthy. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: Families across the country want quality health care to be accessible and affordable—no matter where they live, how much they make, or what health challenges they face.

So I’m glad Chairman Alexander and I were able to introduce legislation to do just that. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: This time last year, some community health centers had to figure out ways to cover basic but crucial, annual reoccurring expenses, like renewing the leases. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: But this time last year… community health centers were left waiting without funding… were forced to cut back hours, staff, &amp; services, &amp; halt planned expansions.. [and] left wondering how to pay their current staff &amp; attract new professionals. @PattyMurray @PattyMurray: Community health centers see over 27 million patients a year—many in rural and other underserved communities… they play a critical role in the local response to national health challenges like the opioid crisis.
