(6/7) This package also eliminates commonsense pro-life provisions that have long held broad support and protect the life of the unborn. (5/7) It shouldn’t be easy to take more of your hard earned money and send it to Washington – it should be harder. 2nd District families are burdened enough by taxes, and the last thing Congress should be doing is making it easier to increase your taxes. (4/7) One of the biggest partisan power grabs gives the Democratic majority the power to raise your taxes with only a simple majority, instead of the supermajority that was in place last Congress. (3/7) That is why I am disappointed that Democrats decided to forgo bipartisanship on their first day in power when they forced through changes to the rules of the House of Representatives that will make life more difficult for our community. (2/7) Whether it is my work to end human trafficking, supporting our veterans, or cutting the red tape that holds back American ingenuity, the needs of #MO2 come first. (1/7) I am honored and privileged to work for you in Congress, and do my best to support bipartisan solutions to our nation’s most urgent problems. to strengthen our community we can ensure that it remains one full of hope and opportunity for the future. I look forward to seeing you &amp; your families back home in Missouri, &amp; if you are visiting Washington, D.C., please visit our new office in room 2350 in the Rayburn Building.

I have no doubt their drive will continue to serve them well in the future! https://t.co/jgCKrJCcPq Throughout my time in Congress, I have met so many hardworking, intelligent, and extraordinary businesswomen. Their impact on our community should be recognized today and every day! #BusinessWomensDay https://t.co/wTsmc3LjXJ These heroes will never be forgotten. #POWMIARecognitionDay https://t.co/TONPn7N7Do This #WorldAlzheimersDay, let’s continue to build awareness and compassion for those suffering from dementia. This is a global issue, and we can all do our part to fight against the stigmatization that surrounds this disease. https://t.co/C1pS50ojvg Earlier this year, I voted to help Missourians fight the opioid epidemic. The opioid crisis is ravaging our communities, but with this additional funding, we can increase prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.

https://t.co/YlKdf4ha2f The average family of four in our area is saving $3,700 per year—certainly not crumbs. The fact is that the tax cuts have ignited our economy, creating record jobs, record investment, and record optimism. Tax cuts work! I was honored to receive the Defender of Small Business Award from @JobCreatorsUSA. Their bus tour made a stop in Eureka, and has been traveling nationwide to share real stories of small businesses who have benefited from the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. https://t.co/vR1dZKIhaW Congress is working with the Administration to communicate to our friends that the U.S. has their backs as they expand trade and development, secure their borders, strengthen human rights, and defend against Chinese aggression. https://t.co/rrnuAYCuDL .@JoaquinCastrotx and I teamed up to introduce the Southeast Asia Strategy Act. This legislation enhances U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia and assures critical partners in the region of our nation’s strong support. It was my honor to speak at the ribbon cutting for Davidson
Logistics’ new headquarters in Bridgeton! The local Boeing partner’s facility spans almost one million square feet, making it one of the largest owner-occupied facilities in St. Louis. https://t.co/RdQ8jkqKG0 Our Constitution has aged well! 231 years old today, and still the standard bearer for freedom and democracy around the world. Happy #ConstitutionDay! https://t.co/SW2X5TEaQV This is great news! We continue to see real results from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. #BetterOffNow 

https://t.co/DPH39O0ue3 The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act also funds the ongoing construction of the new NGA campus in North St. Louis, bringing jobs to our region for years to come. https://t.co/kvJZzYyoRi Congress continues to get work done for the American people. Yesterday, we passed a package that takes care of our veterans, strengthens national security, bolsters U.S. energy &amp; infrastructure, &amp; makes the gov't more accountable, effective, &amp; fiscally responsible. .@FinancialCmte overwhelmingly passed my and @RepMaloney's bill today, the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act! Through this legislation, the US will continue to set the global standards for anti-money laundering and human trafficking prevention. https://t.co/GrXjH1cMol Human trafficking is taking a serious hit thanks to #FOSTA, but we still need to educate &amp; spread awareness about this horrible crime. It was wonderful to speak w/ students at our event today about their research into the topic. Thanks @RepDaveBrat for hosting the discussion! https://t.co/2wMRKvyVRC Thank you @RepDaveBrat for sharing why you joined the fight against human trafficking in your recent op-ed. The battle is far from over! https://t.co/Jn4Z2PZyt3 #NeverForget the thousands who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. That night, President Bush said, “Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America.” America remains a beacon of freedom--resolute &amp; strong. https://t.co/W1kKowgFAx Mental illness is unpredictable and many suffer silently, but we as a community can come together to support the most vulnerable.

I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly confirm this supremely qualified jurist. #ConfirmKavanaugh Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a strong constitutionalist with impeccable legal credentials. His thoughtful testimony further demonstrated the integrity, intellect, &amp; temperament that will serve him well on our nation’s highest bench. https://t.co/YFUPtl1Tp6 Through this legislation, the US will continue to set the global standards for anti-money laundering &amp; human trafficking prevention.

As the co-chair of @ASEANCaucus, I am thrilled to introduce bipartisan legislation with @JoaquinCastrotx &amp; @RepRickLarsen that strengthens US relations with Southeast Asia by helping small business owners in the US export to foreign markets.

After the #TaxCutsandJobsAct became law, UPS announced plans for $12 billion in investments, a strengthening of their employee pension funding, &amp; enhanced value for shareholders. https://t.co/9sRfbbtra4 The battle against sex trafficking isn’t over. It can happen anytime, anywhere. We must continue to provide a voice for the victims and fight for the most vulnerable.
https://t.co/nDFMOTg1Ac The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is delivering real results. Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr &amp; has given about $400 million in bonuses.
