I will do my best to reach out, find common ground, &amp; help this great American institution deliver the results we need &amp; deserve. #PA18 https://t.co/PLJv6QqQph At legion posts, at union halls and on people’s doorsteps in #PA18, we found a faith in America and a fierce determination to make our institutions work again, as they have so often in our history. https://t.co/3Ip25NODYt We've heard a lot of talk about how our government can't get things done anymore, how we're too divided, our institutions too old &amp; slow to respond, our people's faith in democracy disappearing. But that's not what we found in #PA18. https://t.co/mPzHt8CeG0 It is a tremendous honor to take the oath &amp; to represent the people of #PA18 in Congress. Thank you for putting your faith &amp; trust in me. https://t.co/utr5TIhBSa
