Dems began 116th Congress with the promise to clean up corruption &amp; ensure public officials work for the people. #HR1 outlines reforms to make voting easier, end dark money &amp; ensure integrity of public officials I hope the president addresses the national #opioid crisis. About 600 people die each year in Washington state due to opioid overdose, and nearly 20 percent of all heroin-related deaths in Washington have occurred in @snocounty I hope the president addresses the need to invest in the future generation of workers through more skills training, high-quality K-12 #education, access to #STEM education and affordable higher education. I hope the president outlines a well-thought out #infrastructure plan, maintaining federal investment in infrastructure projects to sustain and build on Washington state’s economic growth and put more folks to work. I hope the president outlines a #trade agenda that supports local jobs and the economic stability of the U.S. I hope the president talks about the need for increased #infrastructure investments and advanced technology at ports of entry, new technology to detect unauthorized crossings and more immigration judges and customs personnel, not the need for a wall on the Southern border.
