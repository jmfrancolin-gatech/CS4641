We must answer the president‚Äôs call to put aside the partisanship and come together to work for the common good of our nation ‚Äì just as we did in the 115th Congress (2017-2018), when we passed over 400 bills that were signed by @POTUS, 99% of which were bipartisan. A prosperous and safe America requires improved border security. We also need to strive to reform our dysfunctional immigration laws, develop a solution for our Dreamer population, improve our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, strengthen our national security &amp; promote free &amp; fair trade. This evening, @POTUS put forth his priorities to continue to deliver a stronger, more secure and more prosperous America. "We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" #SOTU "We do the incredible.  We defy the impossible.  We conquer the unknown." #SOTU Happy Birthday! #SOTU https://t.co/KYfhZw1JdB Iran must be held accountable for its human rights abuses, sponsorship of international terrorism and development of ballistic missile. #SOTU I firmly believe that life is sacred and will continue to support legislation that grows healthy families and protects the rights of the unborn. #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: Grace Eline, cancer survivor. https://t.co/KCxjHKmtE0 ‚ÄúIt is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.‚Äù #SOTU We must empower hardworking American families to take control of their health care decisions and provide them with 21st century health care solutions that lower costs and encourage competition. #SOTU Trade is critical to America's Promise, Prosperity and Safety. #SOTU I remain committed to working with all parties to advance border security solutions that keep hardworking American families safe and to address our country‚Äôs dysfunctional immigration laws. #SOTU The dedicated men and women at ICE keep hardworking American families safe.  #SOTU It is imperative that Congress continue working to give our federal and local governments the tools they need to keep our communities safe and fight back against human trafficking. #SOTU RT @SecretaryPerry: Under @realdonaldtrump, the State of American Energy is strong.

By expanding education &amp; job training opportunities for prisoners we can better prepare them to reintegrate into society &amp; be responsible and productive citizens. #SOTU It is imperative that we build a 21st century VA that provides our nation‚Äôs veterans with the best possible care and puts veterans first. #SOTU Congress has worked to provide $6 billion to combat mental health issues and the devastating opioid crisis. #SOTU "The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world." #SOTU The Right to Try Act improves access to experimental treatments for patients with terminal diseases or conditions. This new law gives terminally-ill patients can have a fighting chance to survive and recover. #SOTU Our new tax code is simpler and fairer ‚Äì it lowers tax rates for both individuals and small businesses, nearly doubles the standard deduction, doubles the child tax credit and repeals Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate tax. #SOTU Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, hardworking American families and small businesses have benefited from our bold, pro-growth tax reform. #SOTU For 16 consecutive months, America has created at least 100,000 jobs, including over 300,000 jobs in January. #SOTU The unemployment rate has been at or below 4% for 11 consecutive months, something we have not experienced in nearly 50 years. #SOTU More Americans are finding jobs, wages continue to grow and those that were previously discouraged are once again benefiting from a thriving job market. #SOTU Congress must come together to work for the good of our nation. #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: LIVE now: President Trump‚Äôs second State of the Union Address https://t.co/K4ytXhQmIX I look forward to welcoming @POTUS to the U.S. Capitol and hearing more about his priorities for our nation in the coming year. #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: #SOTU night is here.
