Check out some photos from the #SOTU and my guest, Jon from Puyallup: https://t.co/h0E4MIyl7n What are some of your priorities you hope to hear from President @realdonaldtrump tonight in the #SOTU? 

In our representative democracy, your voice is important. We need to be prepared and committed to effectively combat Russian  aggression through strict #sanctions and with strong #cybersecurity operations and investments. We also cannot make progress together if the President does not acknowledge the threat that Russia poses to Western democracies, including our own. The #health of each and every American is also important to our country‚Äôs success. The President should provide a plan for how we can stabilize the health insurance marketplace and lower prescription drug costs, so that Americans of every age can afford good quality #healthcare. The President would also be smart to address the state of our nation‚Äôs #infrastructure. If we want to end this cycle of slow economic growth, we have to provide forward-looking federal investments in our roads, ports, bridges, stormwater systems and utilities. I've invited a guest from #WA10 to accompany me to the #SOTU His family includes a federal employee who was directly affected by the latest government shutdown. President Trump needs to remember these families when he makes decisions on bipartisan government funding bills. First and foremost, I want the President to express his openness to a long-term bipartisan strategy to keep the federal government open. Our union cannot be strong when families are denied timely paychecks for a hard day‚Äôs work. #TrumpShutdown Like many of you watching at home, I have certain priorities that I hope he mentions in his #SOTU remarks. Tonight at 6 pm Pacific time, President Trump will give his State of the Union address. #SOTU RT @jgeense: I‚Äôm honored to be attending the #SOTU address with my Representative @RepDennyHeck.

Federal employees in #WA10 are facing these consequences and sharing their #ShutdownStories with me. Second, this shutdown is about a president trying to abuse the system to get his way on a policy difference. I am committed to crossing the aisle to keep the government open, but I do not want to condone this abuse of the process. At the last minute, the White House changed its request to $5.7 billion for a border wall. The White House has still not submitted a comprehensive plan on how it intends to spend the $5.7 billion. First, this shutdown is rooted in a disagreement about how to best provide border security. Ds &amp; Rs agreed to $1.6 bil in border security, which is the amount requested in the President's budget. It included investments in drug-detecting equipment &amp; more border security personnel We‚Äôre on Day 25 of the #TrumpShutdown. I‚Äôve spent lots of time reflecting on how we got into this.
