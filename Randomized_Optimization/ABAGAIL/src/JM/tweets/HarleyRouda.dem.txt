Make sure you vote on Tuesday. 
3 Days #FlipThe48th Must Watch üëáüèª https://t.co/oVN7YWmHfi Joe‚Äôs right, Rohrabacher is lying when he states he supports pre-existing condition protections. He voted to eliminate protections 17 times.

Fact: We need to expand affordable health care to every American, not cause more harm to those already suffering.
https://t.co/fm0C6lnnFW We are inspired by each other.  Keep believing in what we can achieve together. @SierraClub

Let‚Äôs bring this home.

#FlipThe48th #FlipTheHouse https://t.co/oWaRDhP2ep 30 years ago Rohrabacher ran his 1st campaign as a term-limits Libertarian.

He has since voted to raise his government pay 21 times, benefited from tax payer funded healthcare, &amp; stuck US with travel costs to Russia.

Broken promises for 30 years.
https://t.co/rSRFS4Q11x @ChicagoMT @ProudResister Thank you Chicago MT! Live now:  Ask Me Anything https://t.co/AQZrxx7YgN https://t.co/a8lqA60vqk 4 Days until the election.

4 Days before we have new leadership in the House.

Vote and take another 4 friends to the polls.

4 Days. Let‚Äôs do this! #FlipThe48th https://t.co/x6gMbB0Hr9 @Nicknlhlz @OFA @OFA_CA @IndivisibleOC48 Thank you. @CMRforall @ShannonBrooke01 @danpfeiffer Thank you Chris. Lack of disclosure laws have created huge loopholes for foreign governments to launder money into our elections.

In order to maintain a free and fair Democratic election, political donations &amp; finances must be subjected to the highest level of transparency &amp; ethics.@StopBigMoney https://t.co/SPN33AdoVe 5 Days.

My wife @KairaRouda and a hand full of other authors started a program called #BookTheVote reminding family, friends, neighbors, and voters across our nation to VOTE. 

This election is the most important election in our lifetimes. 

5 Days. #BookTheVote https://t.co/CMqkFvsspb Hey all,

3:00 p.m. pacific time https://t.co/SLA5SL7Y0X It‚Äôs of no surprise that Congressman Dana Rohrabacher refused to join me and @LarryMantle on Air Talk Radio @KPCC 

Listen in on our conversation about #CA48 concerns, the importance of expanding affordable healthcare, and protecting our coastline. 
https://t.co/lphJJRE7lA I pledge to take the issue of gun violence seriously.

The majority of Americans support expanding background checks &amp; preventing suspected terrorists from buying guns.

Despite the severity of our gun violence epidemic, Rep. Rohrabacher does not support common-sense gun reform. https://t.co/SozpvP2Iaz The GOP has had two years of absolute rule. 

‚ùåAttacks on our healthcare
‚ùåMega Donor Tax Cuts
‚ùåVoter Suppression
‚ùåPolarization
‚ùåFlatline Wages
‚ùåDiscord
‚ùåEnded Environmental Protections

Voters want a balance of power.

We are working on getting out the vote for the final push. I truly appreciate your donation. #FlipIt George O'Neill's ATLAS PAC announced a $24,036 independent expenditure on behalf of Dana Rohrabacher's campaign.¬†¬†

George O‚ÄôNeill has funnelled thousands of dollars of Russian money to influence American elections. For 30 years, Congressman Rohrabacher has been doing the bidding of special interests, while ignoring his constituents. Rohrabacher's inept and toxic brand of corruption needs to go.  And that's exactly what's going to happen on November 6th. 6 Days until Election Day &amp; today is Halloween.

I can‚Äôt think of anything scarier than Dana Robrbacher going back to Congress. Let‚Äôs make sure over the next 6 days we get people out and they vote.

The nations eyes are upon us. Let‚Äôs not leave a single stone unturned. With your help, we will make history Nov. 6.

Please, donate now. Help us Get Out The Vote. #CA48 
https://t.co/jPBfOtCsbo https://t.co/zAzdRZ0Rh0 Our Democracy is not built by career politicians. It's not built by corporate PACs. It's built by We the People.

Check out our new campaign ad. https://t.co/RL2kL4BEeW Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has voted year after year to eviscerate Social Security and Medicare by billions of dollars.

Corrupt politicians like Dana Rohrabacher are more interested in political gamesmanship than in protecting our seniors.¬†

6 Days, vote. 

https://t.co/zBstLN5urr @friscosucks Grubbs said that phone calls to the congressman‚Äôs offices are overwhelmingly opposed to the GOP plan, estimating the tally was ‚Äú2,000 against, five in favor.‚Äù Rep. Rohrabacher‚Äôs office received 2000 phone calls from his constituents urging a NO vote on Trumpcare, which eliminated healthcare protections.

He received 5 calls to vote yes. 
Dana voted yes.

On 11/6, vote out corrupt, career politicians like Dana. 
https://t.co/pkXQGSE9bB Before I decided to run for Congress I sat down with my wife, Kaira, and our kids, Trace, Shea, Avery and Dylan. 

I can't tell you how much it meant to see them talk about what this campaign and this election means to them. 

Check out their video. https://t.co/fWdMmrdYmn Our goal here in #CA48, flip the house to protect our oceans, healthcare, Medicare, and Social Security.
https://t.co/kADCAJoqjc The path to flipping the House starts in #CA48. 

After 30 years we are going to make history and #FlipThe48th 

Thank you @GeorgeTakei #FlipFive https://t.co/c3C1Ev8RzT @VallettaRus @GeorgeTakei Thank you Valletta. @sharingourtruth @GeorgeTakei Thank you Patricia. @marlmidd @GeorgeTakei Thank you Marlene. The Trump administration is ignoring the will of the people and pursuing an agenda that harms the environment and contributes to global warming.

Congressman Rohrabacher is standing with Trump, Ryan Zinke, and the gas and oil industry, not Californians.
https://t.co/Yz31bfZ8AN 8 Days.

In 2008, we elected President Obama, hope and optimism spread over our country. He gave us an opportunity to take our country in a new direction. 

Now we have Donald Trump. 

The first step to taking back the White House in 2020 is taking back the House in 8 days. https://t.co/5rBfO32CiB Young leaders know that climate change is one of the greatest threats to our community. It's why they've joined our campaign. Together, we can protect our coastline and protect the environment for future generations.

We have 9 Days to come together and vote to protect our coastlines, healthcare, Rights, Social Security, Medicare, and Democracy. 

9 Days, Vote. https://t.co/bsnibYmHSK 9 Days.

9 represents the 900 canvassers we had today. 

Because OC voters want real change.

They know we can‚Äôt have an extremist like Rohrabacher representing us any more.

Thank you. Keep up the good work.

Let‚Äôs get out the vote.  We will #FlipThe48th in 9 Days. https://t.co/h7px0dJ9iY What do we want for ourselves and future generations? #TakeItBack

https://t.co/9HrSw0nQaJ https://t.co/WDVxowsPRX RT @Trumpet1984: Please help win back the House and donate to Harley Rouda in #CA48 and the other great Democrats on this thread.

See my m‚Ä¶ #CA48 is a beautiful place to live.

However, the pristine natural beauty is under attack by corrupt politicians in D.C. who deny the threat of man-made climate change.

In Congress, I will work to keep our beaches beautiful and protect our coastlines from offshore drilling. https://t.co/RY5ceaoMvH Today's horrific shooting in Pittsburgh is heartbreaking. Divisive rhetoric and silence in the face of hatred is intolerable. We must all do more to bring our country together and end senseless gun violence. 11 Days.

Our book ‚ÄúWe Won‚Äôt Get fooled Again‚Äù page 11, Rep. Rohrabacher supports the Trump agenda, lifting the ban on off shore oil drilling along Orange County‚Äôs coastline. 

Protect Our Coast. 

Vote NO to Drill Baby Drill Nov. 6

11 Days, VOTE. https://t.co/d0uDPirTBA
