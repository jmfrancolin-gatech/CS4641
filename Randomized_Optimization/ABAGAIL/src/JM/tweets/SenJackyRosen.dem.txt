I stand with the majority of Nevadans who support defending a woman's right to choose. #SOTU This President's repeated attempts to sabotage our health care system have put families across the country in jeopardy of not having access to care. People like my #SOTU guest Tanya, a 3x cancer survivor, depend on the ACA for survival. Ending HIV is a noble goal &amp; I welcome the President’s plan reduce transmission by 2030. But let’s remember that this is the same Administration that has put PEPFAR funding, which has been extremely successful at reducing HIV infections, on the chopping block. #SOTU Rising prescription drug costs are affecting Americans’ ability to afford life-saving medications and both sides of the aisle want to see immediate action. It's time to put the partisan games aside and work together to make prescription drugs more affordable. #SOTU The President's role as Commander-in-Chief also includes uniting people, but he continues to divide us whenever he talks about his wall. The majority of Nevadans don’t support spending billions on a senseless wall. They want smart solutions to fix our broken immigration system. The President is continuing to mislead the nation when it comes to immigration. He needs to look at the facts and then work on a real bipartisan immigration plan that will actually fix our broken immigration system. #SOTU https://t.co/EN8YbiY9dZ Last month, I heard from countless families in Nevada who were struggling to pay their mortgages &amp; car payments due to this President’s shutdown. We can’t let another senseless shutdown happen again. #SOTU If the President is sincere about working together with Democrats then he needs to stop playing political games and start supporting legislation that invests in our schools, fixes our roads and bridges, and makes health care more affordable for working families. #SOTU RT @garymartindc: .@SenJackyRosen has invited to the SOTU a three-time cancer survivor as risk of losing health insurance if federal judge… RT @hsanchez128: .@SenJackyRosen announced she will bring Tanya Flanagan to the #SOTU2019 Flanagan is a three-time cancer survivor who work… I want to thank Tanya Flanagan for coming to #SOTU as my guest and making her inspiring voice heard.

I implore the President to put an end to his political games and come to the table to finally pass comprehensive immigration reform that both secures our borders and moves our country forward. I helped introduce the Keep Families Together Act today to ensure that the federal government carries out immigration procedures in the best interest of detained children. https://t.co/ELz4dwQbE1 Addressing Nevada’s physician shortage will require smart, bipartisan solutions such as investing in STEM education so that we can assemble a strong workforce of medical professionals. I’ll continue to work on ways to help more Nevada students pursue medical careers. Our country is on the brink of a health care crisis and in Nevada, our doctor shortage is one of the reasons why our state ranks last when it comes to access to health care.

Lawmakers have no business interfering with a woman’s right to make personal health decisions. Senate Republicans should be bringing a bill to the Senate floor to reopen the government - not take away a woman’s right to choose.

We need to find sensible ways to stop scam artists from hurting our seniors. https://t.co/OlEOMF9OLS RT @RJpolitics: Senate Democrats seek to intervene in Obamacare court case https://t.co/hhUwdQtK63 https://t.co/JrTx0eCagv RT @jgillanNews3LV: People live paycheck to paycheck says this @TSA worker; we need government to open up. @News3LV https://t.co/upCWavHrHL Becky works day in and day out to keep travelers going through @LASairport safe. She shouldn’t have to fear losing her job or wonder whether she will be able to pay her bills while the President plays political games. The morning after the government shut down, Becky received a call from her family informing her that her younger sister in Hawaii had passed away. Fearing retribution, Becky only took off one day to go be with her family during that difficult time. These are the faces of everyday families who are hurting as a result of the President’s shutdown. The photo I’m holding is of Becky Esquivel and her family. Becky works for TSA. I met with her and other federal workers last week to hear their stories. https://t.co/yy1ZtN9uEM The Attorney General is the Chief enforcer of our nation’s laws. As confirmation hearings begin this week on William Barr’s nomination, we must be able to get answers on whether Mr. Barr will uphold the rule of law. RT @AJCGlobal: We had a great discussion with @SenJackyRosen today in Washington, D.C. Thank you, Senator Rosen. We look forward to more of… The census is supposed to be a tool to help govern. It should never be used to instill fear in our immigrant communities. I applaud the federal judge’s ruling and will continue fighting for fair and equal representation for all of our communities. https://t.co/RJOM8S5R6d RT @hsanchez128: .@SenJackyRosen helps lead Senate effort to protect pre-existing conditions https://t.co/VzvIO6v7E5 I know just how important pre-existing conditions protections are for Nevada’s hardworking families. We must protect our health care from partisan attacks. We simply cannot let these protections be stripped away. One of the first actions I pledged to take in the Senate was fighting to defend protections for those who have pre-existing conditions. Today, I joined @Sen_JoeManchin in introducing the same language I introduced in the House to defend the constitutionality of the ACA. https://t.co/zXTFcM01Bo RT @SenateDems: Following the House passage of a resolution to defend healthcare protections from the GOP's lawsuit, the @SenateDems are re… Visited with some @MyCodeCentral coders this weekend!  As a former coder, I believe investing in STEM education is the key to unlocking opportunities for our children. 💻 https://t.co/5rQaG0DDD5 RT @LegalAidSNV: We were honored to host @SenJackyRosen for a tour of @LegalAidSNV. Senator Rosen met our Consumer Rights Project team &amp; le… People like Becky, Jerome, and the Stubitz family shouldn’t be worried about whether they’ll be able to afford their groceries. They shouldn't be stripped of their dignity. We need to bring a vote to the Senate floor as soon as possible to reopen the government. https://t.co/A3243uCURL I sat down with @Sheriff_LVMPD Joseph Lombardo for an update on the needs of @LVMPD. Thank you, Sheriff, for your leadership and continued commitment to keeping our communities safe! I look forward to working with you to improve Nevada’s public safety. https://t.co/Go7Hba3hvs My staff was happy to attend @ClarkCountySch’s State of the Schools event. Improving access to quality education for our children has been a priority of mine since arriving to Congress. I look forward to working alongside @SuptJaraCCSD &amp; @NSHE to better Nevada’s education system. https://t.co/DyxKbRSlOM Nevada’s vibrant and thriving Korean American community is part of what makes our state so special. This #KoreanAmericanDay, I’m grateful to the many contributions Korean Americans have made to our armed forces, in public service, and to our economy. .@mayacinemas, welcome to @CNLV! Your partnership with @ClarkCountySch will help students gain valuable work experience. Thank you for your commitment to Nevada's Latino community! https://t.co/vTpUcYX17L Nevada families currently in the process of buying a home and small businesses who are in need of a loan are also feeling the effect of this President’s shutdown. Regular families shouldn't have to suffer because of this shutdown. https://t.co/LxJTwjfFc4 Each year, tens of thousands of people come to Las Vegas to bear witness to one of the world’s finest displays of technology — #CES19. As someone who used to write code, you can bet I was geeking out! https://t.co/LPU7kVBDf8 I heard directly from Nevada families who are experiencing real-life consequences as a result of this senseless shutdown. Families are struggling to pay their mortgages &amp; car payments. The President needs to grow up, put a stop to these political games, and reopen the government. https://t.co/MXT3CN5CUo RT @jgillanNews3LV: .@SenJackyRosen meeting with federal employees furloughed by shutdown. They’re missing a paycheck today. @News3LV https… The President cannot continue to hold real families hostage over his inane border wall. Reopen the government and then we’ll talk about border security -- but we can’t make any progress at the border if the government continues to be closed. The Trump Administration's shutdown is on track to becoming the longest government shutdown in modern U.S. history. Nevadans shouldn’t have to suffer over the President’s political games. Today, thousands of federal workers in Nevada and across the country will miss their paycheck because of the President’s reckless shutdown. In addition to Nevada’s federal workers being left without pay, the government shutdown is also slowing down large-scale recovery efforts aimed at helping rural communities to rebuild from last year’s massive wildfires. https://t.co/lkvb6VXwzo About 51,000 TSA workers will miss a paycheck tomorrow nationwide. Roughly 1,000 of those employees work at @LASairport.  We cannot afford to let the President’s shutdown affect our national security. https://t.co/kUEs7rjb94 Food stamps, housing subsidies, &amp; other government services that help working families are all at risk as a result of the President's shutdown. The impacts of this needless &amp; avoidable shutdown are falling hardest on those who can afford it least. https://t.co/Kv7l5IpcJ6 I’m glad to see the House pass legislation similar to the resolution I introduced last year to defend the constitutionality of the ACA. Our fight to protect health care is far from over. I’ll continue to make defending protections for pre-existing conditions a top priority. I’m heading to the floor to join @SenSchumer in demanding a vote on House-passed legislation to re-open the government. Tomorrow, thousands of federal workers will miss their paycheck. We cannot let this shutdown go on for one more day. Nevada plays a pivotal role in the defense of our country. I had a productive meeting with Lt Gen Scobee, Chief of the @USAFReserve, to talk about Air Force Reserve operations in Nevada. I look forward to working together to support our Citizen Airmen @NellisAFB &amp; @Creech_AFB. https://t.co/Qswn8v9yuR To the law enforcement agencies across the Silver State - thank you for your service and sacrifices to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/RnP2Yvx6U4 .@TheRunninRebels made Nevadans proud last night with their historic victory! #UNLVmbb https://t.co/K0GOR2gJdK I’m ready to work with legislators, community leaders, and students to improve access to quality education for our students. My team was happy to attend @NSHE’s Higher Ed 101 forum yesterday with Chancellor @ThomReillyNV to discuss Nevada’s higher education priorities for the coming year. https://t.co/no9F849aWd Our very own @UNLV @rebelvets student, Alexandria Sawin, has been named the 2018 student veteran of the year by @studentvets! Congratulations on your incredible accomplishment, Alexandria! https://t.co/YVdvEtHm3f Dangerous weapons should never be able to get into the hands of dangerous individuals. I’m joining @ChrisMurphyCT because it’s past time we expand background checks for gun purchases. Far too many families have lost a loved one to gun violence. We must act to save lives. We need smart solutions and leadership to address this humanitarian crisis --  not a medieval, ineffective wall that will cost taxpayers billions and certainly not a reckless government shutdown that only hurts working families. The only crisis at the border is the one created by this Administration’s cruel policies and actions towards immigrant families - separating children from their parents, firing tear gas into crowds, and politicizing the deaths of innocent children. Enough is enough. 8 years ago, a gunman in Arizona went on a senseless shooting spree that took six lives and left @GabbyGiffords fighting for her life. Far too many tragedies have happened since that day, and Gabby is still fighting to keep others safe -- and we should too. The Trump Admin’s efforts to ship weapons-grade plutonium to Nevada raises serious concerns about how transporting &amp; storing this waste could affect our health &amp; safety. I’m glad to see a hearing has been set. We need to put a stop to this reckless plan. https://t.co/RTEravN7tL My team was proud to attend yesterday’s vigil alongside @Culinary226 and Southern Nevada’s faith community in support of migrants and refugees. I will continue to stand up and fight for our immigrant community. https://t.co/jrTGTngXPh Excited to announce my senior staff hires! We have a lot of work ahead of us, and I’m confident that with this impressive and diverse group of individuals by my side, we’ll be able to provide Nevadans with the best constituent services available. https://t.co/o8kpDIHN1i Looking forward to working with you, my friend! https://t.co/w33SDpef9t 👋 Nevada, be sure to follow @SenJackyRosen on Instagram and Facebook! Each day that the President continues this shutdown, he’s choosing to hurt Nevada families who work to protect our public lands and keep our outdoor economy running. https://t.co/01vVcFtLqF The Administration shouldn't be planning a pay increase for cabinet members at a time when thousands of federal workers across the nation are going without pay. This shutdown was avoidable. It’s up to the President to come to the table and get the government back up and running. https://t.co/HIhMxNqZx4 So glad to see so many familiar faces in Washington today supporting me on my swearing-in day. https://t.co/WZZDzJgmYa I’m honored to take the oath of office as Nevada’s next U.S. Senator. Nevadans sent me here to fight for their health care, and that’s what I’m ready to do. https://t.co/Ms9pJSrcQn As I look back at the past two years of my service in Congress, I'm proud of everything my team accomplished for #NV03 and for the rest of our state. I'm honored to represent Nevada in Congress and I'll continue to fighting to put Nevada families first as your representative. https://t.co/inKA9yU4Kf I will not stand by and let this Administration allow Nevada families to needlessly suffer. https://t.co/VzlmJ5v1uL The Trump Administration has now allowed the government shutdown to go on for 12 days. That's 12 days of a Republican-controlled Congress leaving federal employees across Nevada without a guaranteed paycheck during the holidays, all while allowing funding for VAWA to lapse. RT @MyCodeCentral: Thank you @RepJackyRosen for supporting STEM in the Las Vegas area and throughout the country.  We appreciate you!!! htt… New Years in Las Vegas is always such a beautiful sight! Wishing everyone a happy, healthy, and wonderful 2019! https://t.co/3XrpXef0Q5 These tragedies shouldn’t be politicized. They should be fully investigated without delay. We need to know what happened and how these tragedies can be avoided. It’s the least that we can do. https://t.co/RhL210Xk4o I plan to donate my pay during the shutdown to organizations in Nevada that help survivors of domestic violence.
