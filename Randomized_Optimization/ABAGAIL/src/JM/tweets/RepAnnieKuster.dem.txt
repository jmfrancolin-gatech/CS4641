Wonderful to join so many old and new friends for today’s swearing in! https://t.co/KvppAIblr9 RT @RepCheri: Today was a special day as Democrats were sworn in and took the majority. What makes it even better is getting to serve along… .@RepSheaPorter has been an incredible leader for the Granite State and has represented #NH01 with conviction. I’m grateful for her service to New Hampshire and know that she will continue to be an important voice for progress in our state. https://t.co/VnKOIo5uZp Honored to be sworn into the #116th Congress today. Now it’s time we come together to reopen the government so that we can get to the work expected of us by the American people. https://t.co/wCNi0C93eT Welcome to Congress @RepPappasNH! Now we get to work! https://t.co/bxZIocKreO RT @HouseNewDems: We are so excited to welcome new @HouseNewDems in the majority. Congratulations to all incoming Members getting sworn in… Thank you @SenatorHassan! I’m grateful for your tireless work on behalf of the Granite State and excited to continue partnering together on behalf of New Hampshire families! https://t.co/4D8l75RAB8 RT @steinhauserNH1: TODAY in DC: Democrat @RepAnnieKuster gets sworn in to a fourth term representing #NH02 congressional district - as the… @SenatorShaheen Thank you @SenatorShaheen for your incredible leadership in the Senate!

We’re ready to serve the people of New Hampshire and roll up our sleeves to do the hard work expected by the American people. Conveniently our offices are right next to each other. Check them out! https://t.co/LJhkeFtvHQ Encouraged by the NH House’s vote to require sexual harassment training for all members &amp; staff. This is a step in the right direction &amp; it sets a good example for communities across the Granite State that are working to combat sexual violence &amp; harassment https://t.co/VzS46z1XIS Happy New Year! Wishing everyone a peaceful and joyous 2019! The efforts to secure resources for New Hampshire and advance legislation to take on the opioid epidemic would not have been possible without the brave families who have told their story and given a personal face to this immense crisis. I’m immensely grateful for their advocacy. https://t.co/xvswwKzqzt https://t.co/ZKU81ZWM5n Let’s all take a moment to give thanks to our men and women in uniform who are away from family, and a big thank you to the police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses, doctors, and many others who are working away on this Christmas day! Wishing a very Merry Christmas filled with family, friends, and joy from my family to you and yours on this special day! The President should work with Congress to reopen the government immediately. These important resources for survivors of domestic and sexual violence are critical to so many women and families. This shutdown will weigh heavily on the most vulnerable individuals, and could deprive crisis centers, shelters and legal assistance programs of important funding. https://t.co/0I6WIjOlK1 President Trump has effectively shut the government down over his ego. The American people deserve much better. President Trump’s game of chicken over the border wall is ill-advised and will not make our country safer. We need comprehensive immigration reform that bolsters border security and protects young DREAMERS, not political stunts. It’s extremely disappointing that President Trump has brought us to the point of a partial government shutdown that will furlough hundreds of thousands of public employees in the middle of the holiday season. Earlier this week the Senate passed a clean funding bill and the House should send that legislation to the President. President Trump said, "If we don't get what we want one way or the other ... I will shut down the government." This brinksmanship is irresponsible and unnecessary I’m disappointed that President Trump and Congressional Republicans are once again bringing us to the brink of a government shutdown. The fact of the matter is Republicans control the Senate, House, and White House. Sending positive energy and well wishes to Justice Ginsburg for a swift and full recovery! https://t.co/0xxzDyEOOC President Trump’s consistent derision of our closest allies and embrace of strongmen and dictators is dangerous and undermines our national security. https://t.co/5srt6DLMOY The resignation letter of Secretary Mattis outlines the loss of American leadership and prestige on the world stage. Our power and strength abroad is bolstered by our alliances with nations with whom we share the values of open democracy and free society. Thank you to all the Granite Staters who have volunteered their time for the @PeaceCorps and have helped make New Hampshire one of the #PCTopStates! I’m so proud of NH’s tradition of giving back and serving others. For more info on @PeaceCorps, visit: https://t.co/GixOk6KvOC https://t.co/nW9OXjiiDZ The full @USGAO report is available here: https://t.co/Fi7n4nsgCy You can watch my full conversation with @SecWilkie here: https://t.co/nSAXkaG2qF Yesterday @SecWilkie committed to prioritizing this crisis but sadly this @USGAO report shows a steady decline in veteran outreach since 2016 that has not been addressed. I stand ready to hold VA leadership to their commitment to address this crisis. Lives depend on it! https://t.co/CBYNsbzHON I’m outraged that efforts to make veterans aware about programs that can support them in times of crisis and prevent suicide have declined. The tragically high rate of veteran suicide is a stain on our conscience and we must do everything possible to help save lives. https://t.co/gFJtnhUGOo Great to tour @SpauldingYouth yesterday &amp; meet w/leadership &amp; kids utilizing center’s services. I applaud @SpauldingYouth’s commitment to improving the lives of children &amp; I’ll continue my work to help ensure all Granite State kids grow up in a happy, healthy &amp; safe environment. https://t.co/TbCd5cvllp As cold weather sets in, shelters like this one opened by @Concord_HRC are all the more critical to help ensure Granite Staters experiencing homelessness have a warm, safe place to sleep. If you or someone you know in NH needs help, call @211NH or visit https://t.co/OzihGiOwI0 RT @WMUR9: New emergency winter shelter opens in Concord https://t.co/v2v0Vhj54L https://t.co/t88gmeVRnz What a joy it was to bring some holiday cheer to veterans at the NH Veterans Home &amp; @VAManchester today &amp; give them Holiday Cards for Heroes made by Granite State students. These cards are a lovely way to honor our veterans &amp; show our gratitude during this special time of year. https://t.co/zLdOOp2J6N Wonderful to spend time with students taking part in our 6th annual Holiday Cards for Heroes event! Sending holiday cards to Granite State veterans is a great way to give thanks to those who have bravely served our nation. https://t.co/YJwT87p00W Thank you! It was wonderful to spend time with your amazing students! https://t.co/QLBQy2NgwA I have so much fun every year speaking w/students about the importance of honoring our veterans during our annual “Holiday Cards for Heroes.” Today I was at Windham Center School &amp; New Searles School &amp; collecting the beautiful cards. I look forward to delivering them tomorrow! https://t.co/a8DleJmGyo I proudly fought for reforms in the Farm Bill to strengthen @USDA assistance to growers who wish to switch to organic. This will decrease our country's reliance on imports of organic food and is a win for our economy, environment and families nationwide. https://t.co/apnshO3RHI Incredible story about my friend @KrissMakeup stepping up to save the life of a stranger having a heart attack. So impressed by her quick reaction and calm under pressure. https://t.co/yMPmX4O6ha Thank you to all the volunteers who took time to honor &amp; remember the brave  men &amp; women who made the ultimate sacrifice at yesterday’s @WreathsAcross America event at the NH Veterans Cemetery. We are forever grateful to all our veterans who have served and sacrificed so much. https://t.co/Z8IoQdVMd7 It’s long past time Secretary Zinke step down. He has consistently catered to special interests at the expense of America’s public lands and environment. His tenure will be defined by scandal and corruption. https://t.co/hHFWyiuwRX RT @SenatorHassan: Last night’s ruling on the Affordable Care Act is being appealed, you can still get covered while we fight these attacks… RT @SenatorShaheen: The ACA is still the law of the land. If you need health insurance or need to change your coverage, you have until midn… I will continue to fight to improve access to healthcare for people in NH and across the country. Republicans have made destroying the ACA the centerpiece of their agenda for years and we cannot let up in our defense of access to quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans. We cannot go back to a time when people with pre-existing conditions can be denied care. Medicaid expansion has helped more than 50,000 people in New Hampshire access healthcare and has been crucial in our fight against the opioid epidemic. This misguided and partisan ruling threatens access to healthcare for tens of thousands of Granite Staters and millions of Americans who rely on the protections enshrined in the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/xECrtH3BJj Tonight at midnight is the deadline to enroll in or change your health insurance plan. https://t.co/LOV6EvOOPF On the sixth anniversary of #SandyHook, we honor and mourn the innocent children &amp; educators who were taken from us on that terrible day, and we hold their family, friends and loved ones in our hearts. Congress must come together &amp; pass reforms to help prevent future tragedies. It’s been a year since @FCC repealed #netneutrality protections. It is long past time Congress acted to protect a free and open internet for consumers and small businesses. #SaveTheInternet #ForThePeople https://t.co/PRexRkK7T6 I’m glad @USArmy and World War II veteran Francis Byrne has finally been awarded the Purple Heart he deserves for his remarkable service to our country. We are forever grateful for his service and that of all our men and women in uniform. https://t.co/Q7d2vEMe5f This is truly tragic &amp; underscores serious challenges on the southern border. A full investigation is necessary to determine if proper protocols were followed. Families fleeing violence &amp; seeking asylum should be treated w/respect, given food &amp; water &amp; a swift medical evaluation. https://t.co/mOAkYcWZmK For 382 years, the brave men and women of @USNationalGuard have put themselves at risk to serve our country and help keep us safe. We salute all of our service members for their patriotism, courage, and sacrifice. #Guard382 This is what the holidays are all about! Thank you @NH_StatePolice for your kindness and for collecting thousands of toys for @ToysforTots_USA to help bring some cheer to children in need.  https://t.co/2553SkznGJ Overhauling sexual harassment policies in Congress is long overdue. To address the scourge of sexual violence across our nation, Congress must lead by example and take survivors' allegations seriously. This is an important first step. https://t.co/kN0JccmN9E Wonderful to connect with my fellow 2012 classmates to celebrate the holidays and our many members moving into leadership! https://t.co/OlbLOlu1EX The heartbreaking situation in Yemen is a stain on the conscience of the entire world. Children are starving to death in front of our eyes. I’m outraged that Republicans would prevent Congress from taking steps to end the death and destruction in Yemen. https://t.co/9IUeeNRcaw
