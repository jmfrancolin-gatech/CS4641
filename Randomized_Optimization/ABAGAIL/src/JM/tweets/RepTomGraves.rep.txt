I spoke with @MelissaAFrancis @AftertheBell &amp; said we should never have to "give up" something in order to secure our nation. This is about finding the right balance of tools and solutions for border patrol to carry out their mission. https://t.co/fvEyLUh0VS As a member of the bipartisan conference committee on border security, I’m negotiating to find a solution that works for U.S. - that includes a wall and giving our brave border patrol officers the resources they need.

I’ll fight their efforts every step of the way. 3/ This is normal &amp; necessary. Not normal is the level of anti-Trump hysteria on the left. The first order of business in the new Congress should be to secure the border &amp; open the govt. @POTUS is willing to strike a deal, he just needs Dems to put our country before politics. 2/ Unfortunately, the #116thCongress begins under the cloud of a partial government shutdown.
