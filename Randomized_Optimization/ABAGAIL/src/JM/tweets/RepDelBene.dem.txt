We discussed how to foster policies that benefit #WA01 farmers and promote a strong agricultural industry in our region. https://t.co/t7Dre3DvD7 Thank you to #WA reps from @NEAToday for stopping by my office. Your advocacy for students is truly appreciated. An investment in #WA students is an investment in the prosperity of our state. https://t.co/CQMZM32YAI I‚Äôm always amazed by the young talent we have in #WA01.

Click here for more emergency info &amp; resources. https://t.co/wxTKWwl6Lg https://t.co/qAXLVRziGs So sad about the passing of Congressman John Dingell. He leaves an incredible legacy after almost 60 years serving in the House. This is the result of the reckless @GOP tax bill House Republicans jammed through Congress promising it would be easier for taxpayers to manage. The truth is hardworking families are enduring needless confusion and anxiety. https://t.co/sNGUfMQ9Z9 More than 1/3 of US workers are in the ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù ‚Äì like driving Lyft or assembling furniture ‚Äì and lack access to traditional benefits. My legislation would create a grant program to help implement &amp; evaluate new models to provide portable benefits to contingent workers. https://t.co/GgkwHqsObh As someone who needed financial assistance for college, I know the impact grants can have on a person‚Äôs life. Today I sat down with @NWIC to discuss how we make sure Tribal Colleges &amp; Universities have the resources to help #WA students thrive. https://t.co/Jrp46TJX1i Scientific research has revolutionized cancer treatment. Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapies (CAR T) are innovative but costly.

Honored to join @SpeakerPelosi and my #SOTU guest Yasmin Ali in wearing white to pay respect to Suffragettes as we continue our fight for #equalpay and equal opportunities for women in America. #StateoftheWoman https://t.co/ODdMv5vkOE To remedy this, she founded @SkillSpire2016, which is committed to strengthening the STEM pipeline for underrepresented #WA communities. I'm thrilled to have her join me at the #SOTU, and to celebrate the contributions immigrants make to our society. Yasmin helped establish &amp; still volunteers for the Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS), starting a night school that has served over 1000 Muslim students. While at MAPS, she found students who wanted to work in the IT industry but who lacked the training &amp; resources. Here I am with my friend and #SOTU guest Yasmin Ali of Redmond. Yasmin embodies what it means to be an American. She's a mom and community leader who moved to the U.S. from India seeking a better life, and has dedicated her life to helping others. https://t.co/t1HgETjsWe To everyone in #WA01 celebrating, Happy Lunar New Year! 2019 is the #YearOfThePig. Fun Fact: The pig symbolizes optimism, enthusiasm and hard work. I had a productive meeting with @TASKuon of @icw and Father Stephen V. Sundborg of @seattleu. We discussed the importance of ensuring #WA students at independent colleges have access to the best educational opportunities. https://t.co/FwGPdbikPi Today we remember civil rights leader and American icon Rosa Parks. Her refusal to leave her seat after a long day‚Äôs work helped spark the Montgomery Bus Boycotts. We honor her courage and conviction in the pursuit of justice. https://t.co/yCri20LgBz Glad the @nytimes agrees we need strong privacy legislation. My bill requires companies to write privacy agreements in plain English, allow consumers to opt-in after they agree to these easy-to-read policies, &amp; give the FTC authority to enforce these rules.https://t.co/TB3sSoujAg Due to the bad weather, my Bothell and Mount Vernon offices are closed today.

Try and enjoy the snow as much as my dog Reily! https://t.co/ceFtCpfrQX I know it‚Äôs not the same without our @Seahawks, but I want to wish everyone a safe and happy #SuperBowlSunday! If we want to maintain a strong economy, we need a strong middle class. Too many families are struggling with stagnant wages. To ensure that all Americans are thriving, we must expand economy opportunity. https://t.co/uyhrt77itT Today, I joined elected officials and community leaders at the ribbon cutting for the SR 99 corridor. I am going to miss the beautiful views from the Alaskan Way Viaduct, but look forward to the end of #viadoom. https://t.co/5dUrJJ6S58 With Valentine‚Äôs Day coming up, I joined Bell Elementary school‚Äôs extended day program in Kirkland to make valentines for #WA01 veterans. #ValentinesforVets is a great way to say thank you to our brave veterans. https://t.co/w7HR2BpIsM During #BlackHistoryMonth I always think of my friend &amp; civil rights hero @repjohnlewis.

Victims need to know they‚Äôll be listened to, not ignored or pushed aside. https://t.co/w1A4ms75Xo There are three million Washingtonians living with pre-existing conditions. During a @WaysMeansCmte hearing, I highlighted how ACA plans are protecting consumers and how junk plans permitted by the Trump administration fail to provide adequate coverage. https://t.co/R0u50q2i6r I agree. Congress has a responsibility to pass bipartisan immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, a permanent solution for Dreamers ‚Äì and yes ‚Äì smart border security that doesn‚Äôt include a wasteful border wall. https://t.co/J0TdfXMAvs In honor of the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, I‚Äôm proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats in re-introducing the #PaycheckFairness Act. When women succeed, America succeeds. #Equalpay for equal work is long overdue, so let‚Äôs get it done. #Ledbetter10 https://t.co/R38Cz10gVi The effects of the shutdown are still causing anxiety for thousands of contractors who work low-wage jobs. Hardworking families shouldn‚Äôt have to ration food.

The family costs are so much worse. The president already let innocent people be used as pawns in his desire to build a wasteful border wall. He should not make the same mistake twice. https://t.co/AkQbUlTHiF Truly alarming. Yet another reason we need strong consumer privacy laws so that you control your information and know how it is being used. My privacy legislation would ensure user protection and promote stronger transparency. #DataPrivacyDay https://t.co/Z8tWmixW6V Happy Birthday to my @WaysMeansCmte colleague, @RepLindaSanchez!

I am introducing legislation this Congress to expand the affordable housing tax credit which will help #WA working families obtain safe, affordable housing. https://t.co/O0qO9g6PYA Today‚Äôs news, and this list of people, is why Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs probe must continue unimpeded. Congress &amp; the American people deserve all the facts about Russian interference in our election, and whether the President was also involved. https://t.co/7WmyMeMNLD The President is finally ending his government shutdown. However, it‚Äôs sad that it took 35 days of families needlessly suffering for the President to do what‚Äôs right. It never had to happen and he must never do this again. https://t.co/Xt7tqBK7fV Read more about my bill to repeal the Cadillac Tax, which hits working #WA01 families due to factors beyond their control such as age, geography, or job occupation. It‚Äôs an unfair tax against families who get their health insurance through their employers. https://t.co/iod8E2FNaB Snapped a photo with our growing group of Dem women on @WaysMeansCmte. Looking forward to working with @RepGwenMoore, @RepTerriSewell, @RepJudyChu, @RepLindaSanchez and @RepStephMurphy on health care, taxes, retirement and trade to help working families.

They‚Äôre going to food banks because President Trump has cut off their ability to afford groceries. It‚Äôs that simple. Open the government. https://t.co/UZLTRBiRJB A prime example of how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting local workers and jeopardizing economic growth in our region. #WA families can‚Äôt afford to wait any longer. President Trump must end the shutdown now. https://t.co/YEzgMydN2R The Trump shutdown is causing serious and unnecessary harm to our economy. The President must stop playing politics and reopen the government immediately. https://t.co/Hie8GZs8TY Congress must pass legislation to protect consumer privacy. My bill would give consumers the control to opt-in to sharing their data w/private companies, which would be audited to ensure they are following the law &amp; protecting people‚Äôs most sensitive data. https://t.co/qzrwyoOQTj 46 years later, Roe v. Wade still plays a vital role in ensuring women have autonomy over their bodies. We‚Äôve made progress, but the Trump administration‚Äôs endless attacks on women's reproductive rights undermine that progress. We must continue to #FightforRoe. #Roe46 It‚Äôs Day 32 of the #TrumpShutdown, and #WA firefighters now lack the resources to keep our communities safe from wildfires. Trump needs to put the welfare of families first and reopen the government today. https://t.co/ATB4TYn65r My Oh My, Edgar‚Äôs in!!Congratulations @11EdgarMartinez on your induction into the @baseballhall! I should also add that Kaylee, a community liaison in my Mount Vernon office, volunteered today at the food bank. Thanks to all of the volunteers for helping #WA federal workers during this difficult time. https://t.co/PsWIpQgqVI If you‚Äôre a federal worker being impacted by the shutdown, the Ferndale Food Bank is distributing food from 5pm-7pm today. They are located at 1671 Main St. in Ferndale. Please bring your ID and a federal government pay stub. Transgender troops are American heroes who deserve our respect and support.

Many #WA federal employees are being forced to use food banks to keep food on the table. I volunteered at @FoodLifeline today to help sort &amp; package food. #OTD, we honor a revolutionary. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr‚Äôs courage paved the way for equal rights for African-Americans. Let today serve as a reminder of the progress we‚Äôve made towards equality, but that our work is far from over. These are just some of the stories my office has heard since the #TrumpShutdown. It‚Äôs heart wrenching that #WA01 families are suffering from a perfectly avoidable situation. The President needs to do his job &amp; reopen the government. https://t.co/2ZH3A1tvY9 Enjoyed meeting with #WA01 representatives of our conservation and recreation organizations. Thank you for the work you do to preserve our beautiful #WA landscape! https://t.co/Mf4JhWh9u7 If true, this would be one of the most serious offenses committed by the President. We must get to the bottom of this to determine if the President ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/CbAAaCf0Iv In addition to hardworking #WA01 government employees missing pay, the shutdown strains resources used to help our #WA ecosystem. Our orcas are in a critical state. Another reason the shutdown must end. https://t.co/J5WchWc2u2 The carelessness shown to immigrant children by this administration is beyond disturbing. My heart breaks for these children and their families. Congress must demand answers. https://t.co/EEFRYk4kd8 Today, I spoke up for the small business in my district that laid off 20 percent of its workers due to the #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have passed several spending bills this month. It‚Äôs time for Trump to put American workers first &amp; reopen the government. https://t.co/pkztcAEBQ5 This isn‚Äôt just lost income. This is missed rent, skipped medical bills, and the inability to buy groceries to feed a family. This is the pain many Americans are feeling because of the #TrumpShutdown, and there‚Äôs no justification for it. https://t.co/XM1Y1kehkl I‚Äôve been hearing directly from #WA01 air traffic controllers, DHS workers, and other federal employees who aren‚Äôt getting paid but are still working. One man has a disabled son who requires $1500 a month in medical expenses. It has to stop. Mr. President, #EndTheShutdown. I‚Äôm excited to be named to the Select Revenue Measures, Trade and Oversight subcommittees in the @WaysMeansCmte! These subcommittees cover some of the most important issues in the lives of #WA01 families. Can‚Äôt wait to get started. Pleased with this decision. Adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census could hurt its accuracy &amp; undermine its overall effectiveness by scaring people into not participating. This could rob poorer communities of the vital resources they need. https://t.co/8yaDT9Aj4S The Trump administration‚Äôs attacks on women‚Äôs reproductive rights must end. Today I joined the @ProChoiceCaucus to highlight the importance of defending access to contraception and family planning services from this president‚Äôs hostile actions. https://t.co/iM1oRZxkPE Like all Americans, I want meaningful border security, but a wasteful and ineffective border wall is not the answer.

No one has the right to interfere with women‚Äôs private health decisions. https://t.co/5yo2kyZuAI This hurts the entire country and it doesn‚Äôt need to happen. The president must end this shutdown now. It‚Äôs Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown and so many families are suffering the consequences. Recently I met with #WA01 housing agencies, transportation providers and small businesses who are also impacted. Today, we honor Korean-Americans across the country and reflect on their tremendous contributions to our society. I am proud to represent the #PNW, a region with rich diversity and a thriving #KoreanAmerican population. Needless to say, people are worried and want the government to reopen quickly. I implore the president to heed this advice and reopen our government. Too much is at stake for hardworking families and small businesses. The #TrumpShutdown is causing anxiety throughout #WA01. Today I met with @MyCommTrans, @UWBGov, HASCO, and Tethers Unlimited to better learn how folks are being affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/JLn3oUhZkv #WA01 residents ‚Äì keep up what I‚Äôm doing in the ‚Äúother Washington‚Äù by following me on Instagram and Facebook!

We should protect their livelihoods. If the president is serious about protecting the homeland he would do his job and reopen the government. https://t.co/bdq4w9ji5m Here‚Äôs a prime example of the #TrumpShutdown hitting home. On top of impacting #WA federal workers, the shutdown could also stifle local economic growth. https://t.co/A7B4BF7oI1 As more information is revealed about the Trump‚Äôs campaign‚Äôs relationship with the Russians, it makes protecting the Mueller investigation that much more imperative. The American people deserve the facts. https://t.co/uwgMDN3afM Presidential addresses are meant to discuss critical issues at our nation's forefront. Instead, Trump used it to stoke fear &amp; mislead the public.

It‚Äôs long past time for Congress to act so we can save innocent lives. https://t.co/W7h1t7IALR Attention #WA01 residents: Today is the last day for open enrollment! Head to https://t.co/ad5LORKUQF to learn about your options and find a health plan that works for you and your loved ones. Republicans have tried time and again to strip health care from 20M+ Americans. As a member of @WaysMeansCmte, I‚Äôll fight this latest misguided attempt. The new House Dem majority will work to strengthen the ACA &amp; protect people w/pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/ZkuiyrEIRi Great to meet Sayan Bhatia, our @CongressionalAC winner for WA-01! His app Clever-Cart revolutionizes the grocery shopping experience. Congrats Sayan! #WA01 https://t.co/0OxZdsvcEu Birth control is health care. I‚Äôm pleased that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of maintaining reproductive health care access for women. https://t.co/tH010PMv3u RT @AMarch4OurLives: Today we mourn 26 lives ripped away too early. Six years ago, Sandy Hook Elementary School was devastated, and the com‚Ä¶ The #MeToo movement was fueled by courageous women who shared their stories. I‚Äôm proud to support legislation that expands &amp; strengthen protections for victims of sexual harassment. We have a long way to go, but this is a step in the right direction. https://t.co/ZKevp7IgXX Timber towns across #WA01 have been in desperate need of good-paying jobs &amp; the use of mass timber in tall wood buildings helps boost economic growth while improving the environment. Proud to see my &amp; @RepDerekKilmer‚Äôs Timber Innovation Act pass the House. https://t.co/U8EV75jNAw The Trump administration‚Äôs latest move threatens to halt research on not only HIV, but many diseases including cancer. This is anti-science agenda is harmful to patients and is unacceptable. https://t.co/XxIiJez8j5 RT @woodcouncil: Thank you to the original cosponsors of the #TimberInnovation Act! @SenStabenow @MikeCrapo @RepDelBene @CongressmanGT @cat‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs own Fed Chief admits that their economic policies aren‚Äôt helping many Americans as wages continue to stagnate. On January 3rd, our new Democratic majority will focus on policies that expand our middle class and create opportunities for all. https://t.co/Xky47svOvj Time‚Äôs almost up, #WA01. Be sure to sign up for health coverage before Saturday‚Äôs deadline. Visit https://t.co/ad5LORKUQF today. https://t.co/Nph5ZcEssD If we want to fix the health disparities in rural communities, it‚Äôs critical to expand the use of telemedicine. I introduced a bill this year to boost access to mental health services through telemedicine for Medicare recipients. https://t.co/fe9Jtz6n4D With child care costs rising and fewer options, too many #WA parents are struggling. Congress must pass the Child Care for Working Families Act, which would ensure families can afford high-quality early learning and child care opportunities. https://t.co/KeD6cet4hB The 1 million+ people in the U.S. living with HIV should not be victims of Trump‚Äôs anti-science agenda. I will keep fighting to ensure scientists have the resources to find a cure for HIV. https://t.co/RUZP42StVO As our economy continues to change, workers must have access to the opportunities of tomorrow. My bill will give them the tools to learn new skills so they can keep up with advances in technology and earn a good-paying job. https://t.co/TRlGlQAh25 This is a victory for women who rely on Planned Parenthood for important services like birth control, cancer screenings, and counseling. #StandWithPP. https://t.co/I81ymeDonz Could not have said it better myself, @BarackObama. If you live in #WA, be sure to visit https://t.co/ad5LORKUQF to sign up for health coverage before December 15th. https://t.co/Ply1YIuXNF .@NancyPelosi is right. President Trump cannot be allowed to hold the fates of Dreamers hostage over his wasteful, ill-conceived border wall. I‚Äôll keep fighting to #ProtectDreamers as we work towards real comprehensive immigration reform. https://t.co/ODC88c5UXi We are now exactly one week away from the open enrollment deadline (12/15). Go to https://t.co/ad5LORKUQF today to make sure you and your family get covered. As the article points out, the ‚ÄúSkagit is Puget Sound‚Äôs premier salmon river, home to chum, king, sockeye, coho and pinks, as well as steelhead.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad these protections are in place to safeguard #WA01‚Äôs vast ecosystem. https://t.co/OkkLdvvm7i Today we remember those brave souls who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. We will never forget their sacrifice on that fateful day. https://t.co/6mFUpntQLK Glad to see @UWBothell trying to expand more STEM opportunities for their students. A STEM education will lead to good-paying jobs and offer people the skills to succeed in today‚Äôs changing economy. https://t.co/Rq5AC5Rflc #OTD 153 years ago, the 13th amendment was ratified which ended slavery. While our nation has made significant strides since that historic moment, we must continue the hard work to achieve full equality for all of our citizens. RT @AAUW: Happy Birthday to AAUW member Rep. Patsy Mink! We are so thankful that she co-authored #TitleIX legislation! #TitleIX is a major‚Ä¶ Snohomish makes up 10% of the WA pop. but accounted for 18% of heroin-related deaths in 2017. See Snohomish's comprehensive steps to combat opioid overdoses.

Health insurance also provides economic security. Research finds that ACA health coverage makes those at risk 25% less likely to fall behind on housing bills. https://t.co/LKGmZ2Y5FD Exciting news for our region‚Äôs fans. Can‚Äôt wait until the first puck drops! https://t.co/Tdif5eEIjP Hardworking middle-class families deserve a raise, but wages remain stagnant for so many. We need policies that support workers and expand access to long term economic opportunity. https://t.co/o83Gt4lvkp A very real glimpse of how Trump‚Äôs reckless trade war is hurting #WA01 small businesses. Actions have consequences, and our small business owners should not be the ones suffering. https://t.co/1DBhkSudBg This is an alarming report for #WA and underscores the need for us to address rising temperatures that could have a devastating impact on #WA01 towns, families, wildlife and agriculture. #ActonClimate https://t.co/z8dhQuZ323 Wishing everyone in #WA01 and around the world a happy first day of #Hannukah! On #WorldAIDSDay, let‚Äôs celebrate the advances in medicine that have saved millions of lives and keep fighting to #EndAIDS. https://t.co/klxydZFw1R George H.W. Bush devoted his life to public service, and in doing so he rightfully called for us to be a ‚Äúkinder, gentler nation.‚Äù May he rest In peace. This is an important reminder for all #WA01 residents.

Two of my bills included in the bipartisan opioid package were signed into law this year. However our work, and this fight, is far from over. https://t.co/RcghajCyAm RT @USHouseHistory: #HappyBirthday to the 1st African-American #WomenInCongress, Shirley Chisholm of #NY. https://t.co/z7Ls2gHnzt https://t‚Ä¶ RT @HouseNewDems: Now over 90 strong, #NewDems will make up more than one third of the @HouseDemocrats. https://t.co/kInoHxq4Ru https://t.c‚Ä¶ #WA is home to beautiful landscapes, so I am not surprised the Skagit River was picked to be on the @USPS ‚Äúforever‚Äù stamp. Proud to represent #WA01! https://t.co/vgNYSzdxIQ #OTD 2 yrs ago, the Gold Star Families Voices Act became law, ensuring the stories of Gold Star Families are preserved for generations. This year I interviewed Monica McNeal, who lost her son in Afghanistan. To Gold Star Families everywhere, your sacrifices won't be forgotten. So inspiring to see talent in our own backyard help @NASA‚Äôs InSight Lander reach Mars. Well done @AerojetRdyne! #WA01 https://t.co/jT90eKb0vn RT @SenFeinstein: In 1977, Harvey Milk‚Äôs election marked a moment of hope and progress not only for San Francisco, but the entire nation. I‚Ä¶ I am proud that so many in our community came out strong to support #WA01 businesses for #smallbusinesssaturday this holiday weekend. #shopsmall #shoplocal https://t.co/fPo3tpAxwF It‚Äôs ridiculous watching Trump dismiss his own administration‚Äôs report on the dangers of climate change. Facts are facts. Our climate is changing, and it‚Äôs time for Congress and this administration to act before it‚Äôs too late. https://t.co/2feDzpWU9S Instead of launching tear gas at women and children fleeing violence &amp; using the crisis to score political points, the Trump admin. should be addressing the dire conditions impacting our Central American neighbors &amp; get serious about immigration reform.https://t.co/Ff5ErTjpoe #OTD, we recommit to eliminating violence against women. I‚Äôll keep pushing for the full reauthorization of #VAWA to support survivors of domestic violence. Today is #SmallBizSaturday! #ShopSmall today and support your local economy and #WA01 businesses. https://t.co/YDmFnwbwHO Ready for another exciting Apple Cup! Let‚Äôs #GoHuskies! For some #WA01 families this fall &amp; winter, high energy costs can make it difficult to keep a home warm and dry.

Wishing everyone in #WA01 and around the country a happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/7N5TfaqYBv My colleagues &amp; I fought hard to make sure the federal gov't kept its promise to fund this project. With this important step forward, Sound Transit can continue their work developing transportation alternatives to alleviate congestion for #WA01 commuters. https://t.co/voZMwLZwlS One of the most traveled holiday times is Thanksgiving weekend.

Too many farmers are now feeling this pain. We need to get back to business by opening up markets for our farmers instead of cutting them off. https://t.co/uHPnFe9Xb7
