https://t.co/AIWkLiHCDg https://t.co/4U8XlaxJ7C What's at stake if Amtrak closes its call center in Riverside:

‚û°Ô∏è 500 jobs lost
‚û°Ô∏è Workers forced to uproot their lives or be unemployed
‚û°Ô∏è Good union jobs replaced with low-wage work
‚û°Ô∏è Families facing uncertainty

I will keep fighting this. https://t.co/gzImKW39uS Watch @will_c_fischer from @votevets explain my #VA2030 plan to improve the VA and ensure that it meets the needs of every veteran who served our country: https://t.co/VwDVTaoDrF Women's rights are human rights.

Immigrant rights are human rights. 

#HumanRightsDay https://t.co/g1D99sVhRw The Trump Administration is continuing to undermine the ACA by cutting marketing efforts to promote the open enrollment period and encourage more Americans to sign up for health insurance.

Wat‚Ä¶ As long as @BetsyDeVosED and her #4profit accomplices continue moving @usedgov in a direction that strays away from its purpose of protecting students and taxpayers, I will continue speaking out on behalf of the students who face a slew of broken promises from these institutions. This is a nightmare. Every student, every veteran, and every American who was looking to achieve their dreams by pursuing an education at an ECA campus, but was instead failed by this #4profit, was also betrayed by @BetsyDeVosED &amp; the Trump Administration.

We will fight to make that happen. https://t.co/uFAnHq37CZ The American people have given us a mandate to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda and there's no better person to take on this historic task than @NancyPelosi.
