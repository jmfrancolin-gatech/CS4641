No American should be forced to endure the conditions that these ranchers face while their government looks the other way. It's disappointing that Democrats keep putting illegal aliens and drug cartels ahead of the safety and rights of American citizens. https://t.co/CPGj67fVHd Travel agency employers should structure their operations/payroll as freely as possible. I am not convinced that industry employers would be inclined to take advantage of employees if they were no longer subject to the DOL’s arbitrary restrictions.

Listen to my new podcast episode to find out more about issues we discussed this week: https://t.co/HUMlwI3pNT https://t.co/fZgwgenlOb Great to see you in D.C. Thanks for the time. https://t.co/fpyKw0dCSB Today Acting AG Whitaker appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a supposed "oversight" hearing.

"....But they knew that America had to prevail.  Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU "It's the Americans."  - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 

Powerful, inspirational moment in the chamber. We truly live in the greatest country. #SOTU Thank you to our law enforcement officers, who put their lives and livelihoods on the lines to defend our liberties in our local communities. You and your families are in our prayers. #SOTU "We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU RT @LauraMclinn: "...and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed Right To Try ."  ❤️
#StateOfTheUnionAddress… Israel is one of the United States’ most enduring allies, and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump kept a significant promise by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and opening our embassy in Jerusalem.

Thank you, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, for your defense of the most vulnerable among us with your executive actions and judiciary nominations. #SOTU "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU Thank you, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, for championing #schoolchoice in tonight's #SOTU. I'm honored to hail from Arizona, which has led the way with many of these efforts. From my op-ed this morning in the @dcexaminer: Foreign trading partners, particularly China, have realized that they can no longer take advantage of the United States.

Thanks @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for your leadership. #SOTU .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump deftly finding moments in tonight's #SOTU address to bring the chamber and the nation together. "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU "...Agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down." - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is correct. The wall is vital for border security. #SOTU .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is listening to the experts to secure our border. Let's build the wall and secure our border once and for all. The safety of future generations of Americans depend on our actions. #SOTU Thank you to all of the ICE and Border Patrol agents who are at the front lines of defending our nation. You all are in our thoughts and prayers. #SOTU Thinking of my friends, Angel Dad Steve Ronnebeck and Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza right now. Their children deserved more from their government. We must secure the border so that what happened to Grant and Brandon never happens again. #SOTU "Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel." The stories I hear down at the border of the discoveries there are enough to make anyone sick. Border security is national security. #SOTU We have a duty, a responsibility, and obligation to secure the border and defend the national security of our country. Congress must step up to the plate and do what needs to be done. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - I stand with you 100%. #SOTU "The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, &amp; financial well being of all Americans." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is right. I've been down to the border. I've talked with Border Patrol agents, Angel families, and ranchers. We must #securetheborder. "The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border." Thank you, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, for continuing to challenge Congress to secure our border. #SOTU I was pleased to vote for the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 in the 115th Congress. The VA needs accountability, and our #veterans deserve the best care possible. We must keep our promises to our veterans. Let's finish the job we started in the U.S. Senate. Let's continue to send constitutional constructionists to our federal judiciary. Thank you, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, for your work on this over the past two years. #SOTU Thank you to all of our Armed Forces who are serving our great nation. #SOTU "My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. " - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's work, along with the work of the 115th Congress to pass over a dozen Congressional Review Acts, have sparked the economy. #SOTU Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @VP for working so hard last year to push #RightToTry over the finish line. It was an honor to work in the House with @SenRonJohnson and @RepBrianFitz to pass this significant legislation. #GiveThemHope #SOTU "Together, we can.... unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future." - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump bringing the Congress and the nation back to the incredible history of American exceptionalism as we lead our country forward. #SOTU "We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #SOTU Starting off the #SOTU in an incredible fashion: recognizing and honoring veterans from World War 2. Thank you, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. We are indebted to all of our nation's #veterans.

Listen to the conversation on @KTAR923 at 6:30 PM AZ time. #AZ05 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We are influencing a new generation of American leaders to defend life, and my hope is that this trend continues until Roe v Wade is overturned. The first right recognized by Americans of every generation is life. I will continue to advocate for #prolife policies in Congress. New York, Virginia, and Rhode Island are trying to reverse the progress the national #prolife movement has made, but I’m thankful that under @POTUS 
@realDonaldTrump's leadership, the federal government has prioritized the protection of life. Since Roe v Wade was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, over 60 million lives have been snuffed out. We will never know how those innocent ones might have changed the world, their communities, or their families. As we work to end abortion, people in several states are cheering the expansion of one of the most barbaric practices America has ever witnessed. Abortion takes the life of an unborn baby – a human being with God-given potential. https://t.co/B3KFTEDSRh Cindy and I send our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Border Patrol Agent Sergio Lopez.

We found out that illegal aliens crossing through this section only have to remove the rope, push back the barbed-wire fence, and cross over the border. That's how easy it is. https://t.co/ZTVo9tzEJm Speaker Pelosi proves yet again that the Democrats are not negotiating in good faith. They have put politics above our national security.

https://t.co/yec1U1H6kD #AZ05 If Democrats believed that the govt should be funded at all costs, they would have voted for the Dec CR that included border wall funding.

Give our Border Patrol agents the resources they deserve.

Improve our existing technology.

Construct drivable roads along the fences.

We can secure the border. We can protect U.S. citizens. It will take resolve, but Congress can - and must - get this done. https://t.co/mBaWHAOp5Y Border Patrol agent Art Del Cueto is a great American, and I am so grateful for his service to this country. It was great to tour the border with him again today. To Art and all of our Border Patrol agents: stay safe and know that we are praying for you and your families. https://t.co/fJDZWUjWJc This morning, I &amp; eight other Members, joined some Border Patrol agents to tour another section of the border wall-or lack thereof. Can you believe that at this point in the Sasabe sector, the fence ends &amp; this crude wire fence begins?! How is this supposed to protect Americans? https://t.co/ktTPyxIrmX Thank you to Angel parents Steve Ronnebeck &amp; Mary Ann Mendoza for sharing their stories last night about how illegal immigration has forever changed their families.

I'll continue to promote these policies as long as I represent my constituents. https://t.co/rtFiW6r7ua Early next week, America marks a dark anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision of Roe v Wade.

Remarkable. https://t.co/fOpAhGexWY As we enter another week of the partial gov't shutdown, I call on Democrats to return to the negotiating table. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has negotiated several ways to resolve this standoff. Democrats, let's talk. And let's not play politics with our nation's national security. https://t.co/0Ym29WwYJV Good luck to everyone taking the oath of office to begin the new term of the Arizona Legislature today. I know you will represent your constituents to the best of your abilities. #azleg Happy Monday.
