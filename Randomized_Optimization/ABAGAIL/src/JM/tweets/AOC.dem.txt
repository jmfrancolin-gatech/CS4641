To protect justice, #WeRemember the lessons that apply today &amp; always ⬇️ https://t.co/KgoknC4lon ¿Por qué no los dos? 😉 https://t.co/HOqmnbwmQm @brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 Classic example is asking an innocent person “when was the last time you hit your dog?”

They say, “never!” But the frame was invoked. A lot of journalism is subconscious - almost all good public communicators know that, for better or worse.

&amp; That’s the real tea right there 🍵 @brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 I do think it’s important to note that questions advance certain frames. What 45 *does* understand is that if he can get media to invoke his narrative enough, people will start to believe or operate in it, regardless of truth. Perfect example is the caravan. @sebastian_byron @brianstelter Ok, I laughed at this @brianstelter Got it! Look forward to joining you all sometime (for what it’s worth, I think we use social media very differently as well. He’s got more of an “man yells at cloud” thing going on 😉) Also: not only does making this comparison because we’re both “good at social media” a) sound out of touch, but
b) papers over the real concerns: Trump’s demonization of immigrants, governance-by-plutocracy, love of authoritarians, and endless stream of indictments in his circle. https://t.co/TVQPetJC25 @jess_mc Thanks! 💜 Today is #HolocaustMemorialDay - a day where #WeRemember not only the atrocities that result from the contagions of hatred + anti-Semitism, but also the fortitude of communities that continue to be impacted today.

A great read for today: Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl https://t.co/siWAoXcjwC You’re doing great, @RepMaxRose! 

As always, we let the people show us the way 😂 Tootsie roll is all in the knees https://t.co/nRDY1NL10c RT @NBCNewsTHINK: Progressive taxation should work as a corrective tax, like tobacco taxes or a carbon tax, fixing the problems created by… When you don’t address human bias, that bias gets automated.

Machines are reflections of their creators, which means they are flawed, &amp; we should be mindful of that.

It’s one good reason why diversity isn’t just “nice,” it’s a safeguard against trends like this ⬇️ https://t.co/NcOivu5ejR RT @EmilyGorcenski: I’m a Lead Data Scientist for a major international consultancy.

#wef19 #WhateverItTakes https://t.co/M3tJhHbZs4 It is truly not okay that posts like these are the everyday reality in the United States, and that some consider the notion of changing it for the better as “controversial” or “divisive.”

Our “normal” is not normal. A better world is possible, and it will come if we work for it. https://t.co/QHY1FLyPev This clip was made at the very beginning of our journey - before anyone knew what was happening. It’s wild to see now.

https://t.co/Djp9Vo2Y8m For almost two years, a mom followed several women as we ran for Congress. I was one of them.

Due to complications from the gov shutdown, I’m sad to say I’ll miss @jubileefilms’ premiere of Knock Down the House.

This film was made, with love, for people: https://t.co/dLnurOR3ss (To clarify, some may have dropped a sentence here or there - but she was one of the 1st to substantively pick up my campaign + didn’t dismiss it. She was one of the only reporters to recognize &amp; take it seriously, thanks to her local reporting + expertise on Queens politics.) Public radio is great! As is @ProPublica, @frontlinepbs &amp; a great deal of other incredible outlets worth our support.

Fun fact: after @TYTPolitics, @brigidbergin at @WNYC was the first to ever write about my campaign - almost a year before my primary win. https://t.co/4KJ4CTFxZi Quote tweet got deleted, but - 

I believe workers should enjoy more of the wealth they create, &amp; that democracy belongs in the workplace, too.

GOP believes people should be paid the lowest wages possible, no matter what they produce, so billionaires can scoop up the difference. If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies, anti-trust, corruption, and ways to address it, I recommend checking out @ZephyrTeachout. 

She literally wrote the book on it. The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally &amp; economically unsustainable.

We can’t simply accept the cliché that “journalism is dying.”

Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too. Most platforms currently have 0 incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information.

In fact, FB *paid* for info tied to conspiracy theories on those demanding for accountability.

It matters. Soros was the 1st to get mailed a bomb last year.

https://t.co/zaf6NpmKPm Gonna keep it 💯: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies &amp; concentration of ownership.

Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism.

W/o a wide range of independent outlets &amp; the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble. @conz Just passed your name along. Wishing you lots of luck and support in this time 💜 I would thank it, but it was never useful anyway. 🚮 https://t.co/GILSWSE0mO @closmedina @KamalaHarris @DoloresHuerta @SpeakerPelosi @MichelleObama What a committed little cub you have! 🐯 Please tell her that I am so proud of her hard work, and that I’m excited to see her up there one day too!
