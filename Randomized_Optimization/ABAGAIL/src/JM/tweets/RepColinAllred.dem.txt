@NormaJTorres @RepSherrill Thank you! Honored to work together for our veterans. RT @NormaJTorres: Congratulations on the new addition to your family, @RepColinAllred! Iâ€™m pleased that our amendment w/ @RepSherrill passeâ€¦ I am excited to hear from constituents at my #TX32 town hall @richlandcollege this Sunday. Though RSVPs are full, we will have some limited space for walk ins, so get there early. Weâ€™ll also be live streaming on my Facebook page here: https://t.co/643JVbabRD https://t.co/PARVZR5fQg Earlier this week, @HouseForeign examined US policy on the Arabian peninsula, including the situation in Yemen. Now more than ever, Congress must play an active role in foreign policy and that is why I was proud to participate in this hearing. 

Watch: https://t.co/hGjzRRGvEf I've received my subcommittee posts where I'll be working hard for #TX32:

@TransportDems
-Highways &amp; Transit
-Aviation
-Railroads

@HouseForeign

@VetAffairsDems
-Disability Assistance &amp; Memorial Affairs 

https://t.co/VwCCUCk1do Thank you @RepSherrill for introducing my amendment and @DrPhilRoe for the support and kind words on the upcoming birth of our son! 

Proud my bipartisan amendment w/ @NormaJTorres, which bolsters outreach for VA child care, passed the House today as part of #childcare4vets bill. https://t.co/HOgEunHZrX Congressman @JohnDingell was a giant and a powerhouse for good who fought every day for his constituents in Congress. His dedication to public service should serve as an inspiration to everyone. My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and their family. We lost a legend today. In 2017, congestion from overcrowded roads cost regular folks who drive an average of $1,445. The time is now to make real investments to address our transportation needs in North Texas and across the country. #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/dojAtGCPou This experience makes it clearer than ever that we need to provide basic paid sick and parental leave so that no matter who you are or where you live, hardworking people can have financial security and peace of mind while spending time with their families. https://t.co/MEcLXIUrks Family is so important and as a country, we must allow for parents to spend time with their babies because providing parents the ability to stay home during this critical period leads to better outcomes for men, women and families. Yesterday, I left Washington to head back home to Dallas where I'll be taking a short paternity leave as Aly and I are expecting the birth of our son. We are so thrilled to start this new chapter in our lives. #TX32 The burden of student loan debt affects many generations. We need policies that will make it easier to retire in dignity and lift millions out of financial hardship. https://t.co/PIOURBXD92 Rosa Parks was a fearless voice for equality, and her decision to say no to injustice catapulted a movement and changed our nation forever. May we always be inspired by her courageous actions. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/lxRN28AFDP Toured @AmericanAir HQ this week and met with all the hardworking folks who help this company succeed in North Texas and connect millions of travelers across the globe. https://t.co/2Qzj3Qp8ce Thanks again to my guest Nathan Cortez for joining me at the #SOTU. Your familyâ€™s work to protect health care is an inspiration to us all and represents the best of North Texas.

Learn more about the Cortez family and their story here: https://t.co/HyycR1ONxA #TX32 https://t.co/gV6LTX8pph Working together in a bipartisan way isnâ€™t always easy, but I'm dedicated to finding common ground on many issues, including infrastructure and lowering the price of prescription drugs. The American people are counting on us to get things done. #SOTU https://t.co/grrgJ850Uf #TX32 I had a great time celebrating the Lunar New Year last weekend, and to everyone celebrating today, #HappyLunarNewYear. I wish everyone in North Texas a prosperous, healthy and happy year. #YearofthePig https://t.co/Lfk38zmcCm My #SOTU guest, Nathan Cortez, and I wanted to share a message before @POTUS' speech tonight. 

It's an honor to know Nathan and his wife Natalie, a young mom who in her last weeks of battling cancer used her voice to advocate for protecting health care for millions of Americans. https://t.co/e7S3srvl4p RT @RepCunningham: Field trips with my fellow freshmen are the best! Enjoyed learning about national security with @RepColinAllred @RepHoulâ€¦ RT @RepSpanberger: Today, some of my colleagues &amp; I went to the NSA headquarters in Maryland. As a former CIA officer, I know how much goesâ€¦ Yesterday, I joined colleagues @RepVanTaylor &amp; @RepRonWright for a bipartisan discussion w/ @NTxCommission on how we can work together on issues like high speed rail &amp; investing in public schools. Looking forward to getting to work for #TX32 &amp; our region. https://t.co/ssa2zreogn https://t.co/sW7V2F5wqq It's my hope that @POTUS moves past the politics of division tonight during #SOTU. We should focus on the many areas where we agree as a nation like lowering prescription drug costs or investing in infrastructure. We must work together to get things done for the American people. I am honored to bring Nathan Cortez from #TX32 as my guest to the #SOTU. Nathan is the husband of the late Natalie Cortez, a brave advocate for protecting Americansâ€™ health care. Her message of hope still inspires me to this day. https://t.co/TuQoZrO1Zu https://t.co/ku6uGA3su4 WATCH: I joined my colleagues to introduce this bill that seeks to end shutdowns as we know it and shift the pain away from hard-working families and onto the decision makers. https://t.co/L3wmm2ebhg Thanks again to the students at my former school, @PershingDISD, for having me this week. Your work to thank our veterans has made me so proud. https://t.co/P4UmHIKSS9 Every #BlackHistoryMonth, we celebrate the role African Americans have played in shaping American history. While we recognize the progress made, we must dedicate ourselves to continuing that progress. Black history is American history, and let's celebrate it every single day. https://t.co/VAgAo8skQp Join me for a town hall and listening session for #TX32 at Fannin Hall at @RichlandCollege on February 10. 

RSVP here: 
https://t.co/u51LvvN4Gd https://t.co/R4b0aLJYjw Today I visited my old school, @PershingDISD, to meet with students and join them in writing Valentineâ€™s greetings to veterans thanking them for their service. 

I'm so humbled by these students who are showing appreciation to those who have sacrificed so much for our nation. https://t.co/QvIMucuoyk More evidence the reckless tax bill passed last Congress is neither helping workers or encouraging businesses to hire. 

We need common sense tax policy that lifts up small businesses and helps middle class families.  https://t.co/UmWfhzJCJs This is simple, everybody should receive #EqualPay for an honest dayâ€™s work. Proud to cosponsor this bill to help ensure #PaycheckFairness. https://t.co/od4QK3oFg0 Relieved the Houston police officers involved are now in stable condition. My thoughts are with the injured officers and their families during this trying and stressful time. 

We are all so thankful and appreciative of their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/tledQZHYhe Learn more about our bill, the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act, that we are leading with @RepSlotkin @RepDeanPhillips @RepHoulahan and other House Freshman here: https://t.co/U7zDhqrD5c #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASAct My colleagues and I are introducing the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act. The Freshman class was sworn in during a shutdown and we want to make sure this never happens again. We were sent here to clean up and reform Washington. This legislation does just that. #NoMoreShutdowns https://t.co/B1irN2fGpf We must move past shutdown politics for good and work together on behalf of the American people. 

Watch my interview with @CBSDFW: https://t.co/0Kx2wJGNj6 #TX32 Unacceptable. This shutdown was over a single policy disagreement and now has cost our economy $11 billion. We must make sure this never happens again. https://t.co/ACngPwuTXc Today I visited @gary_kelly and the @SouthwestAir HQ team in Dallas along w/ @RepEscobar -- we even had the chance to fly a simulator. 

Iâ€™m looking forward to working together to bolster our aviation infrastructure &amp; help Southwest create jobs through my role on @TransportDems. https://t.co/113tRtokRk Stopped by for an interview and Q&amp;A with @richlandcollege students. You all asked some great questions on some of the most important issues facing our nation. 

Watch our conversation below and I look forward to talking again soon. 

ðŸ“º: https://t.co/FDL9Mm24G7 https://t.co/vfBreyZkl2 https://t.co/Uam3ByGLsH Thank you to the Greater Dallas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce for hosting such a wonderful Chinese New Year celebration. 

I look forward to listening, learning and working together over the next two years. https://t.co/At939vnwiJ It was great meeting with North Texans this weekend from @USinventors and the @alzassociation, Dallas &amp; Northeast Texas Chapter. 

And thanks to the Akin family for stopping by and saying hello. It is always so inspiring to meet young people who show interest in public service. https://t.co/6VY2AgbqGL Toured U.S. Army Corps Lake Lewisville site w/ my colleague @michaelcburgess this week. 

Itâ€™s so important we work together to bolster our regionâ€™s water infrastructure and I thank @USACEHQ for sharing their expertise and for their hard work every day on behalf of North Texans. https://t.co/AUwrzXhv03 This is long overdue, but I am glad the President has come to the table and agreed to open the government. Moving forward, I'm hopeful that we can work together in a bipartisan way on the many important issues facing the American people. 

My statement: https://t.co/QReAxjguIf These North Texans deserve to receive the paychecks they have earned instead of needing to apply for unemployment benefits. No more delays. The Senate and the President need to come to the table so this shutdown can end. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/RqgaZdzI9y Congratulations toÂ @DFWAirport on being named 2019 global Airport of the Year! This recognition is the result of the cooperation and tireless dedication of all the hardworking folks at DFW Airport. https://t.co/jaxpWODWuh It was great to meet with my friend Mayor @Mike_Rawlings today to discuss how we can work together to deliver real results for the people of Dallas. Thanks for coming by the #TX32 office. https://t.co/Xpahb3HJn0 Proud to serve North Texans on @TransportDems @HouseForeign and @VetAffairsDems. Ready to get to work. https://t.co/6GbjI6zpwG #TX32 RT @TexasTribune: In a @dallasnews column, @RepColinAllred said Congress should be focused on helping middle-class families take home moreâ€¦ Our focus should be on helping families take home more of their paychecks, get better jobs &amp; lower health care costs. Instead, this shutdown is an attempt to use the paychecks of hardworking folks to win a policy disagreement. Read my op-ed in @dallasnews: https://t.co/JqcaoNJEgm Dr. King embodied the ideals our country was founded upon, and he compelled our nation to live up to the idea that all men were created equal. Today, we honor him by recommitting to working towards a more perfect union, the one he dreamed of. #MLKDay https://t.co/LH3eXoyOLe It was an honor to be w/ the @cityofmesquite and the Mesquite NAACP to  celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

Thank you for such a wonderful event that allowed us to reflect on what Dr. King's work means to so many people. #MLKDay https://t.co/blnde3OPuC https://t.co/NmXe0twzpI Iâ€™m proud to already have a bipartisan track record because working together is the only way weâ€™re going to solve the big problems facing our nation, including ending this shutdown and getting the government back open.

Watch my interview with @WFAA: https://t.co/5zHJfn4vib I am pleased that the President is open to finding a bipartisan agreement to secure our borders and protect Dreamers. But first, itâ€™s time to end this harmful shutdown so bipartisan negotiations can begin. Honored to serve North Texans on @TransportDems, @HouseForeign &amp; @VetAffairsDems. Ready to get to work to improve the lives of everyday folks and keep Texas on the right track. https://t.co/yE4YOmAebv RT @RepMarkTakano: Iâ€™m excited to welcome the new Members of @VetAffairsDems:
@RepMikeLevin
@RepMaxRose
@RepBrindisi
@RepGilCisneros
@RepSuâ€¦ It was good to meet with experts this week at @TxDOT to discuss projects to improve roads &amp; bridges across North Texas. Because of our region's rapid growth, we have many unique infrastructure needs. As a new member of @TransportDems, getting to work on this is a top priority. https://t.co/ToZGztkWQ9 @TransportDems Thank you. Ready to get to work. RT @TransportDems: Welcome to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, @RepColinAllred! https://t.co/zoPMZ2fq3H RT @HouseForeign: We are excited to welcome these 12 new Members to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs: @RepColinAllred @RepJimCosta @Râ€¦ Proud to announce the committees I will serve on in this Congress:

@TransportDems
@vetaffairsdems
@houseforeign
   
North Texans face so many issues every single day and I canâ€™t wait to get work across these committees on behalf the people in our region. Thank you for stopping by. As someone who relied on the help of good folks at the @ymca as a kid, I know exactly how important your work is to communities in North Texas and across America. I look forward to working together. https://t.co/DBH2huNmly This is simple, no one should have to work without a paycheck. Period. It hurts working families and our economy. 

Letâ€™s get the government back open and get these folks the paychecks they have earned. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/GgpqIcGNzu Had a great meeting w/ students from @TheArcherCenter who are in Washington for internship programs. 

Thanks for visiting and I look forward to all the good work you will do for your country while you're here. 

And follow our official Instagram at https://t.co/09VUKMBBrk #TX32 https://t.co/f435wzIXD2 It has been more than three weeks since the Violence Against Women Act expired because of this unnecessary government shutdown. This legislation and its invaluable programs should not be held back while this shutdown drags on. https://t.co/S9QelAEYAj Stories like this are sadly all too common in Texas, which holds the highest uninsured rate in the country. 

We need a system that works for everyone. And lowering costs for care should be priority number one. https://t.co/oeMFi81u7p The bottom line. Washington shouldnâ€™t be playing political games with the paychecks of hardworking Texans. 

We need to open the government and get it working for the American people. Jeanne is also a veteran and has been in the armed forces or civil service for 32 years. https://t.co/eLmxyLhr0n And Scotty, who works at the Bureau of Prisons and is a veteran. "Being able to serve the community is an honor and pleasure." https://t.co/wm9SxQkCvV At my roundtable yesterday, federal workers shared their stories with me about how the shutdown is hurting them and many others across our region. 

People like Sandra, who is a single mom and works at TSA at DFW Airport. https://t.co/ckOryR4Idl Today I held a roundtable w/ federal workers affected by the shutdown. Most of these public servants are working for free and wondering how theyâ€™ll be able to make ends meet. 

Itâ€™s time for the Senate to do their job and pass the bipartisan House bills to reopen the government. https://t.co/1r2p70tOAK https://t.co/VCEtnvCh8y It was an honor to be a part of the Parade of Champions today with Highland Park High School students as the their football and tennis teams celebrated state championships. 

You have made your community proud. #GoScots https://t.co/pyXgOGQdk4 We need to return political power to the hands of everyday citizens and make sure their voices are heard.

That's why I'm cosponsoring HR 1, which will help stop the influence of big money and special interests, and strengthen our democracy. https://t.co/i4zXAImpyc Iâ€™m proud to have led the effort to take the first step forward this year to protect Americansâ€™ health care. My resolution passed with bipartisan support and will help protect our health care in federal court. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/ggje5Kx5Kl Hardworking Texans &amp; their paychecks shouldn't be used as bargaining chips to fulfill an empty political promise. @AFGENational held an event in Dallas today to highlight the harmful impact of this shutdown on workers like Tony, a furloughed veteran. North Texans deserve better. https://t.co/ksCcrpYYAN We voted with bipartisan support last night to open @USTreasury and the IRS, which should be welcomed by @POTUS, not met with veto threats. 

The American people need to get the tax refunds they are owed and get their mortgages approved in a timely manner. https://t.co/tMQbR3pW6i The American people need to know that Congress is on their side, and we are working together to protect the progress we have made, and work to lower costs for everyone. This resolution is a first, but important step in that effort. My resolution that puts the House back on the side of the American people just passed w/ bipartisan support. I made a promise to North Texans that I'll fight every day to defend their health care, including protections for those w/ pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/z5RcvM69bY Learn more about the resolution here: https://t.co/uHIYlIlNmQ In a few minutes, I will be speaking on the House floor in support of our resolution to defend the Affordable Care Act in U.S. federal court. 

Watch here: https://t.co/HfAQ8Q9OxW This morning I was with my colleagues discussing our work to end the shutdown and our resolution that puts the House back on the side of the people and protects the Affordable Care Act. 

Proud to help lead this charge to #ProtectOurCare. 

Watch: https://t.co/5kjDaf3pQp https://t.co/SuBuzk3SHY .@POTUS offered no solutions and no end to a shutdown that he caused, over a border wall we donâ€™t need and canâ€™t afford. This is not the leadership the American people need. 

We can open the government tomorrow if the President will just come to the table. In my first Dear Colleague letter Iâ€™m urging my colleagues to support my resolution to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and itâ€™s protections for people with pre-existing conditions in court. Tomorrowâ€™s vote will put the House back on the side of the people! https://t.co/gqFTHMPUwM Good meeting w/ Cesar and Ryan from @NATCA Texas who updated me on how the shutdown is impacting air traffic controllers, half of which are veterans in North Texas. 

We need to end this shutdown so that our economy can stay on track and so that our govt can get back to work. https://t.co/oOVnvtB3ol Today, on the anniversary of the tragic shooting in Tuscon when Rep. Gabby Giffords and 18 others were shot, and six were killed, Congress will introduce a background check bill as a common-sense first step toward reducing senseless gun violence. https://t.co/LfsFjflrfu Ordinary folks should not fear they will lose their health care because of a partisan lawsuit. My resolution puts the weight of the US House behind the fight to ensure this lawsuit fails, and protections for those w/ pre-existing conditions remain intact. https://t.co/w6lryFe3m0 We can work together on real border security and comprehensive immigration reform. But the President shouldnâ€™t be holding government funding hostage over an expensive, ineffective wall that we donâ€™t need. https://t.co/eoj92sbFqw RT @CBSNews: .@FaceTheNation starts now. This week's guests include @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenatorDurbin and a panel with newly-seated House Deâ€¦ Unacceptable. This shutdown is hurting job growth and taking a toll on North Texansâ€™ paychecks. Mortgages canâ€™t be approved and federal employees are working without pay. @POTUS needs to come to the table and work w/ Congress to open the govt immediately. https://t.co/tBWan89ZTD Tune in to @FaceTheNation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CST as I join my fellow freshmen colleagues to discuss working together to open the government and deliver real results for the American people. https://t.co/4hi6jA2qme It was great to catch up with @JulieFineNBC5 about our first week in this new Congress working for you, including our resolution to protect Texans' health care against partisan attacks. https://t.co/QUm6NwIOlG It was great to welcome so many North Texans into their Congressional office in Washington today. Thank you so much to everyone who stopped by our open house! https://t.co/FOotcTfwb0 For us and for North Texans today was such a special day. 

I am honored to serve the community I grew up in.

We welcome everyone to our new office in Washington at Cannon 328. 

Follow along here on Twitter and on Facebook at https://t.co/Mu3knKjXO2 for updates! https://t.co/rII4qOe9jM This resolution puts the U.S. House of Representatives, the People's House, back on the side of the people and protecting their health care. https://t.co/f0m6Ck610w https://t.co/185Uq8ZJxE On my first day in Congress, I'm proud to lead the charge against this partisan lawsuit attacking Americansâ€™ health care. We will not stand idly by while special interest forces and their allies in Washington look to rip away health care from millions of hard-working Americans.
