RT @GlennKesslerWP: Trump Laid Out Evidence That a Wall Is Needed. We Took a Hard Look. https://t.co/oSpbamudlK @PaulEGarcia6 Thank you for your leadership, courage and dedication. It was important to send a message that we will not allow our hard working public servants to be used again and again as bargaining chips or hostages. Please thank your colleagues for me üôèüèΩ My statement on the deal to temporarily reopen our government and end the #TrumpShutdown üëá https://t.co/hDssPcPzpJ I have much gratitude for our devoted patriots, hard working public servants who work for the federal govt.

-Security guards
-Janitors
-Food service folks

https://t.co/DQU‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm relieved the President has agreed to separate funding government from his political demands...for now. Government employees should not be hostages. They are public servants who deserve our respect, thanks, and the salaries they have EARNED. RT @jonfavs: For 35 days, Trump and Congressional Republicans inflicted pain on millions of Americans - for nothing.

#ReleaseTheHostages
#PayOurEmployeesNOW https://t.co/Q0xfJcBRDT For over 15 yrs, we've been promised comprehensive immigration reform in exchange for "securing our borders."
