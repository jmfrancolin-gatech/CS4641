Click here to RSVP: https://t.co/E4RTGpJr4z Yesterday I took my first vote to protect Iowans with pre-existing conditions. I've said from day one, I will do everything in my power to make sure we never go back to a time when insurers could deny coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/jAquo767j0 I do not believe that it is appropriate for Members of Congress to receive paychecks while Iowa families suffer and our security is compromised due to government dysfunction. I've requested for my paycheck to be withheld until the government re-opens. https://t.co/JR9WXivJiD Iowans are feeling the very real impact of this shutdown. Right now in our own backyard, small business owners are suffering, farmers are struggling to provide for their families and agencies tasked with keeping us safe are understaffed and unpaid. It's time to end this shutdown. I will support measures that effectively strengthen our border security, but I want to make sure we spend taxpayer dollars wisely, while also keeping our government fully open and operational. That's why I voted for over a billion dollars in funding for more border patrol agents, drones, e-sensors, and other innovative technologies that can better secure our borders and protect our communities. I've always said we need to strengthen our border security. As a member of Congress, and as a mom, my first priority is to keep our communities and our families safe. https://t.co/WMoN6KPARu All Iowans are impacted by this partial government shutdown.
