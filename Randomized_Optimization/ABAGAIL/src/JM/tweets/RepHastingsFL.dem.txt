The House has passed nearly identical language. @POTUS needs to end this charade and open the government! Continuing to hold out with no path forward is not leadership, its brinksmanship. The President has back himself into a corner and is causing long-term, possibly irrevocable harm to our country. Government websites are vulnerable. Food inspections have stopped. Hurricane preparations have stopped.  Airport safety is increasingly compromised. National Parks are being permanently damaged. Federal employees are at risk of losing their cars, their homes, missing payments for medications, education, or other bills. Coast Guardsmen were advised to sell their possessions and others to trade chores for rent. @RealDonaldTrump continues to make history for all the wrong reasons.

One by one, Trump‚Äôs most capable and independent advisors are quitting. Soon, the President will have no professional policy experts by his side, only politically-minded sycophants unwilling to challenge him. This should alarm everyone. His resignation letter reads, ‚ÄúMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held," contrasting Trump‚Äôs nonchalant approach to America‚Äôs leadership across the globe.

In 2017, there were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in the United States, the highest in decades. We cannot hope to prevent future school shootings without confronting the role of guns in gun violence. (5/5) By continuing to ignore the overwhelming evidence and embracing policies that don‚Äôt make students safer, @RealDonaldTrump is trying to turn the keys to our public schools over to the gun lobby. The Administration is using our children to drive its reckless agenda. (4/5) Rather than emphasizing proven methods for preventing shootings from ever taking place - such as anti-bullying programs, mental health support, &amp; culturally responsive practices, the School Safety Commission Report focuses on the moment a shooter is on campus. (3/5) Even worse, Secretary DeVos is using the report as an opportunity to push a radial effort to rescind anti-discrimination protections in schools, falsely blaming shootings on ‚Äúdiscipline.‚Äù (2/5) The Federal School Safety Commission Report released today reads as if it was written by NRA lobbyists. Rather than address key drivers of school shootings ‚Äì easy access to handguns and assault-style weapons ‚Äì it proposes putting more guns in schools and arming teachers. (1/5) Friday‚Äôs absurd court ruling follows 70+ failed attempts by Congressional Republicans to dismantle the ACA &amp; 2 SCOTUS rulings upholding the law. Dismantling life-saving protections that help children, seniors, &amp; those with pre-existing conditions is not in America's best interest https://t.co/f3RjoOn6XT ‚ÄúNearly 40,000 people in the United States died by guns last year, marking the highest number of gun deaths in decades.‚Äù 

I‚Äôll never understand those who place a higher value on guns than human life. @HouseDemocrats will pass gun control next year. The Senate must follow suit. https://t.co/XrK7hrjynd Today marks six years since the tragic #SandyHook shooting claiming the innocent lives of 20 children and six educators. Let us remember the families who lost loved ones and renew our commitment to bring safety back to our schools and end #gunviolence. The President's conflicting comments on the National Climate Assessment exhibit his lack of knowledge &amp; concern on issues pertaining to the environment. I have joined my colleagues in urging @POTUS to remain committed to the Paris Agreement &amp; enforce clean air &amp; water safeguards. I commend the House's passage of a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill that includes support for farmers, life-saving programs like SNAP, conservation efforts, &amp; important animal welfare provisions such as the Dog &amp; Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, which I have been proud to champion. https://t.co/dCEz0QKx0m Secretary Pompeo is continuing to undermine our intelligence community and the very agency that he once led.  It is time for the President to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The #DirtyWaterRule will cancel Clean Water Act protections for the streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions of people. We can't let that happen. We must #ProtectCleanWater With the #DirtyWaterRule, the President is moving to undo decades of bipartisan protection for clean water, putting our health and outdoors at risk of more toxic pollution! #ProtectCleanWater Despite huge public support for commonsense protections for clean water, President Trump chooses  to side with dirty energy polluters over scientists, our health, and the environment with his #DirtyWaterRule. We can't allow it to move forward. #ProtectCleanWater I implore @POTUS to put politics aside and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. The Paris Agreement was reached after years painstaking negotiations, with the promise of leaving future generations with a cleaner world. The President‚Äôs own administration knows the dire economic hardships our nation will endure if we ignore this. I‚Äôm proud to have joined @RepRoybalAllard in urging the Department of Labor to reverse the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed rule which would undermine labor protections for children and patients. Keeping our communities safe should always take priority. https://t.co/DmLuY0HUNA Open enrollment in https://t.co/eiE3FcHjtf ends December 15th!  It‚Äôs not too late to #GetCovered https://t.co/9Re2Yt7ezh In recognizing four journalists and one news organization that exemplify the ‚ÄúGuardians and the War on Truth,‚Äù Time has acknowledged the extreme courage and great personal risk journalists take in the pursuit of uncovering and reporting the truth. https://t.co/jAI4BcT1B8 https://t.co/W4K7EKvZre @RealDonaldTrump controls the WH. The GOP controls Congress. They have the power to keep the government open or to shut it down. ‚ÄúProudly‚Äù choosing a shutdown that needlessly harms countless American families to gin up his supporters would be a moral failure in leadership. https://t.co/1iOpNM2Vd9 Proud to join @RepKClark, @NitaLowey, @RepEliotEngel, @RepBarbaraLee &amp; @RepLoisFrankel today in introducing the Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act. @SecPompeo must reinstate the Repro Rights section on the @StateDept's Annual Human Rights Report. #ReproRightsAreHumanRights Today on #HumanRightsDay, we celebrate 70 years since the @UN General Assembly adopted the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As incoming Chairman of the @HelsinkiComm, I will continue to #StandUp4HumanRights, equality, justice, &amp; human dignity. Five marines are still missing following last week‚Äôs tragic accident. My thoughts and prayers are with their families. I offer my full support to @IIIMEF, @USForcesJapan, and the @USMC as they continue to search for these missing service members. I extend my condolences to Capt. Resilard‚Äôs family during this most difficult time. Our nation grieves with you as we honor Capt. Resilard‚Äôs bravery and honorable service to our country. I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Jahmar Resilard. Capt. Resilard, of Miramar, FL, was an F/A-18 fighter pilot in the Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 242 stationed on Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi, Japan. The UNGA‚Äôs rejection of the US-sponsored resolution condemning Hamas for proliferating terror and firing rockets into Israel is an abject failure of the international community. https://t.co/WxySc85xWx I am proud to join @EleanorNorton in the effort to establish #DCStatehood. The nearly 700k residents of the district deserve equal representation. https://t.co/KtJIU7ayJW Wishing a #HappyHanukkah to those celebrating the Festival of Lights around the world.

We must address the gun violence epidemic plaguing our country. https://t.co/lAx1WFSQFN I proudly support H.Res.1159, recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The ICWA made important changes to the foster care system to ensure that Native American children can stay connected to their heritage when being places with families. The United States has lost a dedicated public servant. President George H.W. Bush was the epitome of an American statesman: he served with distinction, championed diversity and freedom, and led our country with integrity, faith, and compassion. https://t.co/RTpKGnA9bl Proud to join @RepGwenMoore in introducing H.R. 7195, the Social Security Enhancement &amp; Protection Act. Social Security is a vital program that needs protection. This bill will ensure basic living standards &amp; protect our most vulnerable from poverty. Whether @realdonaldtrump wants to believe the #NCA4 or not, #ClimateChange is a clear and present danger to the health and wealth of the American people. The new Democratic House majority will #ActOnClimate! In the 20th century, sea levels rose at a rate unseen in at least 2,800 years because of #ClimateChange. Trump tried to bury the #NCA4 last week, but the new Democratic House will #ActOnClimate to protect America‚Äôs future. #NCA4 The #NCA4 found that, globally, 16 of the last 17 years are the warmest on record. It‚Äôs past time for Congress to #ActOnClimate to protect the health and wealth of the American people. #ClimateFriday The #NCA4, a report by 13 federal agencies including @ENERGY, @EPA and @NASA states: ‚ÄúFuture impacts and risks from #ClimateChange are directly tied to decisions made in the present.‚Äù It‚Äôs long past time to #ActOnClimate. #ClimateFriday The VA‚Äôs announcement that it will ignore federal law and cheat veterans out of their GI benefits is insulting and unacceptable. The Trump Administration‚Äôs leadership of the VA has been characterized by gross negligence and severe failures in oversight. https://t.co/szfYYzW2xB Now, more than ever, the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation must be allowed to continue unimpeded. Congress must act to ensure that no one, be it the President or members of his administration, be allowed to interfere or stifle this investigation. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has brought 192 criminal charges against more than 30 defendants in his investigation into President Trump‚Äôs involvement of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. Today‚Äôs guilty plea from President Trump‚Äôs former attorney Michael Cohen makes it clear that the President repeatedly lied about his business interests in Russia and that his associates were willing to lie and deceive Congress to cover it up. The historically diverse 116th Congress will be the 1st time that 2 African Americans will hold top leadership positions in Congress simultaneously. Congrats @OfficialCBC Members @RepJeffries on being elected Democratic Caucus Chair &amp; Rep. @Clyburn on being elected Majority Whip. Congrats @RepKarenBass on being elected the next Congressional Black Caucus (@OfficialCBC) Chair. I look forward to working together to ensure equality &amp; justice for African American communities across our nation. @POTUS' discriminatory ban on transgender individuals bravely serving in our military would weaken our national security &amp; country. Diversity is a strength. Democrats won't let these prejudiced policies arbitrarily single-out transgender individuals who've felt the call to serve. When our government tear-gasses children fleeing from violence, many of whom are still in diapers and don‚Äôt even have shoes, we sink to the level of illegitimate despots. Every American should be outraged! https://t.co/Z7gfpZPnW3 @NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will land the @NASAInSight robotic lander  on the surface of Mars today. Watch #MarsLandingDay live here at 2PM EST: https://t.co/nI7pALxlDg Good luck @NASAJPL! President Trump‚Äôs attempt to bury his own administration‚Äôs National Climate Assessment is as shameful as the report is shocking: higher temps, rising sea levels, deadly wildfires, and more category 5 hurricanes affect us all, but minority and low-income communities suffer most. RT @RepSarbanes: On Day 1, Democrats will deliver something real for all Americans ‚Äì the most ambitious set of democracy reforms in a gener‚Ä¶ As we each take time today to give thanks, let us also keep in mind those who are less fortunate and recommit ourselves to bettering our communities. I wish everyone a safe and happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/kn75VogLyA President Trump‚Äôs shameless statement on Saudi Arabia is not only  disturbing, but completely undermines the credibility of our  intelligence community and our role as a champion of human rights across  the globe. https://t.co/4PbTxMhKHd Does your family have health insurance?

Now's the time to get your family an affordable plan. Visit https://t.co/gQW9MzuuiA to get started. #GetCovered by Dec. 15!  https://t.co/HskmEG07hl Please remember the 5,500+ service members deployed to the border as props of the @RealDonaldTrump Admin. They are in tents with virtually no electricity. They are away from their families. They are costing taxpayers $200M. They are also prohibited from interacting with migrants. Republican leaders have advocated for purposefully not counting the votes of FL servicemembers deployed overseas &amp; voting absentee. It is disgusting that @POTUS &amp; like-minded members of Congress would favor such a tactic to disenfranchise members of the military. #CountEveryVote I am deeply saddened by the devastating impacts of the California wildfires. I extend my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones and my prayers are with the communities impacted. On this Veterans Day, we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and remember those who have served our nation in the name of freedom and democracy. Gov. Rick Scott‚Äôs attempts to block votes from being counted in South Florida is the height of absurdity. There is zero evidence of fraud. The canvassing board is working diligently to count every vote ‚Äì as it should. #CountEveryVote My heart sank this morning when I learned of last night's shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. It is with profound grief that I offer my condolences to the families that lost loved ones and prayers for the injured. https://t.co/MyCpLYmXue @POTUS continues to obfuscate the truth but he is not fooling anyone. He was wrong to revoke @Acosta‚Äôs WH credentials. The video of the exchange speaks for itself. Asking tough questions and holding the President accountable is the responsibility of the press. https://t.co/dHwZhxMpOT If the President fired Attorney General Sessions to in any way weaken the Mueller investigation, it would be an alarming abuse of power. No one in our country is above the law, and Congress must act swiftly to protect the Special Counsel. https://t.co/KwRxeC7IIg RT @RepJerryNadler: Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJus‚Ä¶
