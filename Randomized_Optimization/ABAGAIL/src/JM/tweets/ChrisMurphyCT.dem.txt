Yemen crisis
Khashoggi murder

Saudi/Qatar split
weakening of NATO and EU
trade war with China going nowhere good
UN laughing at Trump speech
etc etc etc Trump will play up negotiations w North Korea.

Yes, talking with North Korea is good. But so far, Kim has PLAYED Trump. We gave away joint military exercises, and Kim kept building his nuclear program. And instead of trying to weaken Kim, Trump declares his "love" for him. Trump will pat himself on the back re Venezuela.

But nothing has happened in 2 weeks since he recognized Guaido. Military support for Maduro hasn't budged, and if Maduro survives, our feckless play makes us weaker. Trump will claim he's weakening Iran.

Nope. Iran's economy IS weaker, but Europe is ignoring U.S. sanctions, keeping their economy afloat. Trump's DoD confirms Iran's ability to maneuver in Syria hasn't been compromised at all. And hardliners in Tehran are gaining strength. Trump will say no one has been tougher on Russia than him.

Bull. He fawns over Putin publicly. He handed Syria diplomacy to the Kremlin. He's loosening sanctions on Putin's top oligarchs. He won't fight Russian propaganda. He pretends they don't manipulate our elections. Trump will make some claim about ISIS as "defeated".

It isn't. Not by a long shot. They don't control territory (that's good), but there are still 30,000 fighters, and Trump has allowed Iraq to marginalize Sunnis again, setting the scene for an ISIS revival (that's really bad). Trump has compromised our country's security in a million ways. His Administration is an ongoing foreign policy garbage fire.

I think we are better off pressing for political reform everywhere we do business or have interests, not just the place where the guy who controls the oil doesn't like us. If Trump cared about consistency, he would make the realist case for intervention in Venezuela (getting rid of Maduro is good for the United States) rather than trying to pretend his Administration all of the sudden cares about toppling anti-democratic regimes. U.S. foreign policy has always been a muddle of values-based and interests-based decisions. But Trump takes it to the extreme. No recent President has so enthusiastically embraced autocrats, making these occasional pro-democracy interventions so hard for the world to parse. Strong men around the world are befuddled.

RIP.  https://t.co/YBFAXaoEAW RT @brianschatz: @ChrisMurphyCT It’s zero. The number, as it turns out, is zero. hey @brianschatz how many bills has mcconnell brought to the senate floor to reopen the government since the shutdown started?  i've lost count. Go @RepJahanaHayes https://t.co/h8BwV4mj9J Diana lost her only son to gun violence. Now, she's calling on Congress to pass universal background checks. https://t.co/s0sSsP3y2n As a parent, this makes me sick to my stomach. It's time for the president to end this shutdown and reopen the government. https://t.co/kYCeBQkdwU Just a reminder that we could end this shutdown TODAY if Mitch McConnell let us vote on the same legislation we passed unanimously before the new year. This generation has grown up with school shootings. And they are going to be the ones to end them. 

We can start by passing universal background checks.
https://t.co/6ZZooJ3cAG Great news for @HartfordHealthC workers in Connecticut! https://t.co/3S9YcuU2qy We are now 25 days into this shutdown and there is no end in sight for families in Connecticut who are struggling. The President needs to stop playing games with their livelihoods and reopen the government. 
https://t.co/6ksDUKVyqq Re those “European freeloaders”: European troops are still fighting in Afghanistan, 17 years after the one and only time NATO’s mutual defense clause was invoked, requiring Europe to come to America’s defense.   https://t.co/iFK2kooVb2 Strong. Well said @senatemajldr. https://t.co/2ET0TIMnVk There are thousands of Coast Guard families in Connecticut trying to figure out how they're going to make it through the month without a paycheck, through no fault of their own. 

The President needs to reopen the government, now. 
https://t.co/eqFAqXL22G 47,200 members of Coast Guard are missing their paycheck today because the President is holding them hostage over his stupid wall. Families in Connecticut aren't pawns in some game. President Trump needs to stop this and reopen the government. 
https://t.co/3VEjhQRxyV Thank you to everyone who came out to my town hall in Derby this weekend to talk about the shutdown.
https://t.co/lyjVJEIVQs I mean it’s quite possible that someone mainlining Fox News 14 hours a day might not actually know what King said... https://t.co/3VZ11KhGdg With young kids, I’ve spent lots of time around 5-7 yr olds during the Trump presidency. And the ONE thing they all get is the wall. To them, it’s the antithesis of what they’ve been taught in school - to embrace people different from you; help folks in need, not shut them out. RT @ThePlumLineGS: Oof.

Here's another poll from CNN. Even worse for Trump than Post/ABC.

55% blame Trump for shutdown; only 32% blame Ds… The Trump/Pompeo frame for the Middle East, in which democracy and human rights don’t matter, Saudi Arabia is the white knight, and everything is about Iran, is just profound foreign policy malpractice. https://t.co/vXVW66naTR RT @CoryBooker: 97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It’s time Congress do its job &amp; pass this critically important le… Trump and his allies basically guaranteeing the court case is open and shut by continuing to argue that the reason to declare a national emergency is “Dems are bad”. https://t.co/gj4s1w4zqr And in case you want to know more about Brett, his poetry (second book for sale now!) and his obsession w Connecticut diners, check out this profile piece the Hartford Courant did on him. https://t.co/4qkj3qrkUk For 6 years, Brett Maddux has spent every day in the car w me as we travel CT. A published poet &amp; the state’s resident expert on diners, few people are more interesting or love CT more. But mostly, he’s just a fantastic friend and I’m super sad today’s his last day on our team. https://t.co/Vo2ey96fqP Yup, they do. https://t.co/yA27WPjo6k I think Senators should be doing town halls even during a shutdown. Maybe even more important now. https://t.co/E7F9mqkBPh
