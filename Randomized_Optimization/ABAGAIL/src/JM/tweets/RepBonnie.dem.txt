Yet, as many people are going to discover on this year's returns, it did little for regular Americans. THIS Congress is going to change that. Students often struggle with real-time costs and future debt for the education they need to pursue their dreams. The #EITC Modernization Act would allow roughly 3 million students who are eligible for Pell Grants (many of whom have dependents) to receive the EITC. By 2020, an estimated 117 Million Americans will need caregiver assistance. Often this care is given by unpaid caregivers, primarily women, who provided billions of dollars in unpaid care in the United States in 2012 yet are 30% more likely to face financial instability. When EITC has been expanded, poverty decreases and financial stability increases for working- and middle-class people. The #EITC Modernization Act increases allows caregivers and students to access EITC. While Republicans propose more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires on the false promise that the money will "trickle down" to everyone else (a promise that has failed to materialize over and over) the Earned Income Tax Credit has been proven to work. Working families are no longer making ends meet. Wage growth for most workers has been stagnant while costs have gone up. The ability to save is non-existent, a medical emergency or a broken-down car can send people over the edge. This Congress I'll be reintroducing the #EITC Modernization Act, a bill that would make a simple but important change to the tax code, allowing caregivers and full-time, emancipated higher-education students to receive the earned income tax credit. https://t.co/qibLbiafxo Thank you @SenatorMenendez !!! https://t.co/VMUVtERHZJ RT @SXMProgress: "I just can't believe, God, that You allowed him (Trump) to be President of the United States of America." @RepBonnie talk‚Ä¶ The claims Trump and his spokespeople continually make about the dangers of migrant caravans are not about warning America of some actual threat.
