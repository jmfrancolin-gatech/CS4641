Justice Kavanaugh's first published opinion in an abortion case is true to form in siding with the anti-abortion forces. Stay tuned for more. https://t.co/4wlWmEFkRR I encourage everyone in the path of this weekend’s severe weather to prepare, stay safe, and take its potential impact seriously https://t.co/iFNx0ZXiqx Just as with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, it took a lot of courage for Dr. Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson to come forward to be heard. Their courage is part of the change we need and the responsibility we all share to end the scourge of sexual violence in our country With this second serious and credible allegation of sexual assault, Justin Fairfax should resign. This is not a partisan issue. It was a privilege to serve with @JohnDingell for 6 of his 59 years in the House. He was a champion for so many important causes, from civil rights, to the environment and affordable health care. We will miss his tweets, humor, sharp wit, and dedication to public service. https://t.co/YS1E8KI6Zo I welcome the bold national framework of the #GreenNewDeal that tracks so closely to what Hawaii is already doing and what many of us have long advocated to enable communities, families, and individuals to thrive. Confronting the challenge of climate change requires a comprehensive approach to transforming our country in a way that prioritizes environmental health and wellness, while also expanding opportunity and creating good-paying jobs as we transition to a low carbon economy. From committing to 100 percent renewable energy, to embracing a carbon neutral economy, Hawaii has taken aggressive action to combat climate change because of the threat it poses to our way of life. Poverty is not just a mindset. Birth control does not cause cancer. Transgender children are not delusions.

But at the 11th hour, Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from his far right-wing base and chose to shut down the government for a $5 billion down payment on his vanity wall. This shutdown is totally unfair, completely unnecessary, and entirely the President’s fault. Two nights ago, the Senate did its job by passing a bill to keep the government open with the expectation that the House would pass it and that the President would sign it into law.

At the end of our visit to Dilley, we were able to speak with Patricia, who has been here with her daughter for six months—much longer than DHS is legally allowed to detain minors. They crossed the border fleeing gang violence in Honduras. Yesterday, we visited two family detention centers in Texas—Dilley and Karnes.

Our producers desperately need the maximum assistance practicable to get back on their feet. https://t.co/cOA2oGheHU This development is yet another reason not to rush Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. The Committee should postpone this week’s vote. As I said during the hearing, this is why the #MeToo movement is so important, because often in these situations, there is an environment where people see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. That is what we have to change. It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible and I believe her. From @oha_hawaii: Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated a low level of knowledge about the history of Native Hawaiians &amp; their pre-existing sovereignty well before western contact. His nomination is alarming to all American Indians, Alaskan Natives &amp; Native Hawaiians. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/YZunQZ6pFe The American people deserve to know the full extent of Brett Kavanaugh's lies regarding indigenous communities. That's why I made a motion to subpoena any additional records relating to his work on Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Alaska Natives. #WhatAreTheyHiding https://t.co/Y3zxONqMam Mahalo to @NCAI1944 for your advocacy on behalf of native communities.

They wouldn't spend this kind of money unless they thought Judge Kavanaugh was on their side. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/9q8G5c4lHc Last night, Judge Kavanaugh once again misstated the facts on Rice v Cayetano and the rights of Native Hawaiians. It's disturbing that any judge, much less a nominee to the Supreme Court, would manipulate the facts to reach his own political conclusions. https://t.co/IAAeNamreS We're back for another day of questioning Judge Kavanaugh. Watch live here: https://t.co/I04OIsQrwt. These are the docs Rs don't want you to see—because they show that Judge Kavanaugh wrongly believes that Native Hawaiian programs are Constitutionally questionable. I defy anyone reading this to be able to conclude that it should be deemed confidential in any way, shape, or form. https://t.co/yj31vDNGia Yesterday, I referred to a "Committee confidential" document where Judge Kavanaugh questioned the validity of programs that benefit Native Hawaiian programs, and by extension, Alaska Natives. If you're coming after @SenBooker for releasing these documents, count me in. https://t.co/3SezHKRMft Here are Judge Kavanaugh's own words on Native Hawaiians. In Rice v.

But his extreme dissent in Garza v. Hargan tells us all we need to know. He would be the key vote on weakening or overturning Roe #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/nwl8pAG4Ei In 1999, Judge Kavanaugh wrote an op-ed and amicus brief that disparaged the Native Hawaiian community. He wrongly asserts that Native Hawaiians are not an indigenous community. I won't let that stand. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/6sc0vNRyNu Last December, 15 brave women came forward and shared their stories of sexual assault and harassment by Alex Kozinski, a mentor of Judge Kavanaugh's. Judge Kozinski's behavior was an open secret, yet Judge Kavanaugh said he saw nothing, heard nothing, and obviously, said nothing. https://t.co/jdzIQ69bev Watch live as I question Judge Brett Kavanaugh: https://t.co/10yzJXsE4e RT @SenatorLeahy: THREAD: Between 2001 and 2003, Republican Senate staffers hacked into and stole 4,670 files on controversial Bush judicia… .@fred_guttenberg It was an honor to meet you today.

And they are hiding those records from the American people. https://t.co/PQPmfGm6Ju Judiciary Committee Republicans made an unprecedented demand that Democrats pre-clear the questions, documents, and videos we would like to use at the #KavanaughHearing.
