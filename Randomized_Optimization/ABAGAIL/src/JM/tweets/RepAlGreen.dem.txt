@TomSteyer Thank you dear brother.

Gov. Northam’s refusal to resign for his bigotry is a symptom. Failure to act on Pres.

The House of Representatives once again rejects white nationalism and white supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance. If you reject bigotry, will you reject the bigot? #ImpeachmentIsNotDead Mr. President, is it fair for hundreds of thousands of federal workers to be held hostage for 22 days and counting because of a wall that has nothing to do with their jobs and that you promised Mexico would pay for? 
#ImpeachmentIsNotDead First the shutdown forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to go without pay, and now the President wants to divert disaster relief funding to pay for a border wall that he promised Americans Mexico would pay for. Mr. President, you truly have no shame! https://t.co/QB1bpWzxEt The humanitarian crisis at the southern border is rooted in the President's bigoted policies. If white babies were dying at the border, our response would be vastly different. One step closer to impeachment. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
https://t.co/vwN8zUspez .@realDonaldTrump is correct in saying there's a crisis at the southern border. However, his deceitful projection of this crisis is inflamed by his policies rooted in lies and bigotry. The reality is this is a humanitarian crisis that begs a REAL humanitarian response NOT a wall. On a 60 Minutes segment with Anderson Cooper, @AOC said that President Trump is a racist. SHE IS RIGHT! I would also add that he can and should be impeached for the bigoted policies emanating from his presidency. #CountdownToImpeachment #ImpeachmentIsNotDead I applaud the community for adamantly seeking #JusticeForJazmine. @HCSOTexas has 2 suspects in custody.  We cannot allow the suspects’ complexion to diminish our sense of outrage. As details unfold, we must continue to demand #JusticeForJazmine. Impeachment is really about our country. It's not about Democrats. It's about democracy. #CountdownToImpeachment #ImpeachmentIsNotDead The start of the #116thCongress offers the opportunity for growth, change, and improvement for all of America, which necessitates that House Democrats correct the injustices perpetrated by President Trump’s policies over the past 2 years. Let’s make this year better than the last. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. #NewYearsDay #HappyNewYear2019 Another child, 8-year-old Felix Alonzo-Gomez, has died in the custody of border patrol agents. Mr. President, how many lives must be lost before we acknowledge the magnitude of this humanitarian crisis? A wall won't fix this human tragedy. #JusticeForJakelin #JusticeForFelix Today, I’m wishing everyone a safe and happy holiday. I encourage us all to not only be a blessing to family &amp; friends but also to be a blessing to someone we don’t know and will likely never see again. Let’s spread holiday cheer through giving. #HappyHolidays #MerryChristmas2018 In case you missed it, please watch yesterday’s discussion on the government shutdown and border wall with @TeamCavuto &amp; I. #SundayMorning

I’ll be on with @TeamCavuto in the 11 AM hour (ET). https://t.co/hZmoiod1jb I visited the border on Tuesday and saw the effects of bigotry firsthand.  I saw people housed in circumstances the ASPCA would find deplorable for animals.  My visit reinforced my belief that #ImpeachmentIsNotDead.
#JusticeForJakelin What I saw at Lordsburg Border Patrol Station yesterday did not honor Lady Liberty’s plea for “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” We’re in a humanitarian crisis. We can’t rest until we have answers. We can’t rest until we get #JusticeforJakelin. Today, I am headed to the Antelope Wells Port of Entry and Lordsburg Border Patrol Station in New Mexico with my Democratic colleagues, demanding a full investigation into the conditions and circumstances surrounding the death of 7-year-old Jakelin. #JusticeforJakelin Fort Bend &amp; Harris County Texans, you may be eligible for a health insurance tax credit or Medicaid!

For the love of country, please stop sowing seeds of divisiveness that will erode our democracy and put our republic at risk. If President Trump compared persons of any ethnicity or religion to termites, I would call that statement bigoted. Since Minister Farrakhan has compared Jews to termites, I must call that statement bigoted. Bigotry is unacceptable regardless of the source. https://t.co/xPxma08UAb Just as we fought to eliminate poll taxes and literacy tests, which prevented African-Americans from voting, we must now eliminate voter suppression procedures in the registration &amp; voting process at Prairie View A&amp;M University and across the nation. #LetStudentsVote https://t.co/ib8pJWANWn It's a dangerous time for journalists, from #AustinTice to #JamalKhashoggi.

If the majority of the justices are members of this conservative group, will the majority of the decisions be federalist decisions? Within a 15-day period, America celebrates 2 historic holidays: Freedom Day on #Juneteenth &amp; #IndependenceDay on the #FourthOfJuly. Remember Freedom Day as you enjoy the 4th of July. #GodBlessAmerica Mr. President, diversity in higher education is about giving persons who have been denied access the opportunity to succeed on their merits or fail on their demerits. It’s about our graduates being as diverse as the country they live in. I’m at the border to look into the humanitarian crisis created by President Trump. More to come. #FamiliesBelongTogether Gun violence cases all have one thing in common: a gun. Thoughts &amp; prayers are not enough. Congress must act now. #MarylandShooting Any assault on any #Journalist is an assault on the freedom of the press. A free people must have a free press. #MarylandShooting The raid of #Stonewall Inn 49 years ago today sparked a 6-day riot that ignited the US LGBTQ Rights Movement. To commemorate the rioters' legacy &amp; honor the trail they blazed, 94 of my colleagues &amp; I sponsored a bill to celebrate June as #PrideMonth. Where was the outrage from Republicans when the President was advocating  police brutality and complimenting the bigots in Charlottesville? #StandWithMaxine
https://t.co/T7zTcG3QCT Today America mourns the continual loss of humanity &amp; equality since @realDonaldTrump took office. The Trump v. Hawaii ruling legitimizes the attack on religious freedom &amp; the 1st Amendment by the Trump Administration. History will judge this decision. #WeWillNotBeBanned Today I celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community as an ally &amp; strong supporter of liberty and justice for all. #PRIDEHOUSTON https://t.co/XUrh50ss5n Mr. President, you terrorized children with the family separation policy knowing the solution was in your hands. You demonize migrant families &amp; pretend to be their savior with a stroke of your pen. This is what xenophobia looks like. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead https://t.co/Vrjs2bCtO2 RT @RepGutierrez: We are gathering for a press conference at the House Triangle right now with the Members and children who joined us on th… RT @RepGutierrez: Rep ⁦@RepAlGreen⁩ joins ⁦@repjoecrowley⁩ and ⁦@repjohnlewis⁩ in speaking out against President Trump’s policy.  #Families… Mr. Otting, discrimination &amp; economic disparity exist regardless of whether you've observed them during your 30 years in banking or not. The habitual &amp; blatant refusal to acknowledge the facts of discrimination in lending merely perpetuate this systemic racism. #OCCnoColor Several Members of Congress &amp; I marched with @RepGutierrez to Customs &amp; Border Patrol HQ to protest the separation of children from their families at the border. We must speak truth to power &amp; denounce the wrongs of this administration at all costs. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/2t6reriyeB This administration’s cruel immigration policies have been tearing families apart for too long. The barbaric practice of separating parents from children for simply seeking refuge must end because a great nation doesn’t divide; it unifies. #FamiliesBelongTogether Mr. President, geopolitically speaking, those who sacrifice their tried &amp; true friends for untried, new friends may end up with no friends at all. #TrumpKimSummit https://t.co/Jv6XXQ9QhW We march to honor the millions of women veterans in America. We march to show how far women have come as the fastest growing group among veterans. We march to show how far we have to go as women veterans face unique challenges after serving America w/pride. #WomensVeteransMarch https://t.co/nko1ifpWeO Mr. President, a pardon won’t bring back the countless minorities who make up 62% of unarmed persons killed by police. It won’t bring back Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Danny Thomas, &amp; others. It won’t negate your comments that have incited harmful arrest practices among officers. https://t.co/iJ3Rwo2RLD Mr. President, we have a duty &amp; an obligation to protest injustice when we see it. Peaceful protest is a right of all Americans. I salute @Kaepernick7 for his courage to peacefully protest the injustices against unarmed persons killed by police. https://t.co/WuvmyHbJRp Today, several witnesses before the House Financial Services Committee blatantly denied the existence of invidious discrimination in lending in this country although evidence consistently supports it &amp; testing has revealed it. https://t.co/yzA4EHHl3h Mr. President, you've shown us that you believe you have absolute power. America is not a monarchy. I introduced HJRes 115 in 2017 to deny you the power to self-pardon. Ben Franklin was right. "We have a republic if we can keep it." #ImpeachmentIsNotDead https://t.co/aqjeYBtnng Today we #WearOrange to bring awareness to the 96 Americans who die everyday due to gun violence and the hundreds who are left injured. We #WearOrange for victims at home, school, work, the movies, the park, &amp; anywhere we are not shielded from gun violence. 💛✊🏾💛 With record numbers of white nationalists running for office, America cannot allow bigotry to further invade Capitol Hill. Enough is enough. We have to destroy the belief that bigots holding political office is acceptable &amp; it starts with the President. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead To whom it may concern, your efforts to suppress the legitimate impeachment of an unfit president are impacting the Democratic base. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead If bigotry is justifiable grounds for firing #RoseanneBarr, then surely the same should apply to the President. We have reached a point where many will dare to call Trump's actions bigoted, but dare not call him a bigot &amp; hold him accountable. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead .@TomSteyer &amp; I are fighting the good fight. We, along with millions of others, are committed to the impeachment of a person who is unfit to be President.  #ImpeachmentIsNotDead Mr. President, take the time now to take heed to what I previously indicated to you in my March 10th tweet. You still have the opportunity to create a meaningful summit, not a meaningless photo op. #NorthKoreaSummit https://t.co/YYhW2DmrQY RT @RepAlGreen: .@SpeakerRyan bring the gun safety bills we have pending to the floor of the House for a vote. The American people need sol… .@SpeakerRyan bring the gun safety bills we have pending to the floor of the House for a vote. The American people need solutions, not just moments of silence for another group of victims. If you won't act, step aside. https://t.co/rMQXaqeY5y #ActionNotTalk #SantaFe #Parkland RT @RepAlGreen: Talking tough is not enough, it's time to walk tough talk to the floor of Congress and vote. #SantaFeHighSchool #ActionNotT… Talking tough is not enough, it's time to walk tough talk to the floor of Congress and vote. #SantaFeHighSchool #ActionNotTalk One year and one day after I called for impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives, my position is still the same. As long as President Trump occupies the White House, #ImpeachmentIsNotDead. RT @RodneyEllis: My thanks to @RepAlGreen for inviting me to share with the committee my experiences and recommendations as we continue to… Although the President has the might to impose his bigotry into our policies, his might won't make his wrongs right, it will only prolong his wrongs. The solution is impeachment. #ImpeachmentisNotDead
https://t.co/GZ6nzOjuIA Today marks the first day of Islam's holiest month. Ramadan Mubarak to all who celebrate. I wish you well as you begin this time of consecration and fasting. Mr. President, as the First Lady makes her recovery, she, you, and the rest of your family are in my prayers. Godspeed. Please join me at 11am CST for a LIVE press conference as I respond to Leader Pelosi’s comments regarding impeachment. https://t.co/5zCZ5O8GPg Congratulations @HoustonRockets🚀 for reaching the Western Conference Finals! Best of luck against the Golden State Warriors! #runasone In October, I challenged @SecretaryCarson to identify funding cuts to affordable housing. Today I still advocate for #NoCuts as I stand w/ #OurHomesOurVoices in the fight to increase access to affordable housing for the 3 in 4 individuals who need but don’t receive it. https://t.co/0RsgKV1MEG Les deseo un Feliz Cinco de Mayo departe de su Congresista Al Green del noveno districto congresional de Texas. https://t.co/zAAk5Ywr87 Mr. President, you have continuously spewed contradictions. You have a strategy of offering a smorgasbord of lies for your supporters so they can choose the charade they believe justifies your perfidy. It's not about truth. It's about Trump. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead Mr. President, the Constitution does not allow you to fire the person investigating you. Permitting such would allow any guilty president to avoid impeachment by preventing an investigation. #RepealandReplaceTrump Mr. President, your refusal to be interviewed by the special counsel concerning his investigation will NOT exonerate you. Your firing Mr. Comey to thwart being investigated was, is, &amp; ever shall be an impeachable offense. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead #InternationalWorkersDay celebrates workplace rights like the 8 hr workday, paid vacation, &amp; sick leave. It also reminds us of the harsh realities of unfair wages &amp; unsafe working conditions that too many still endure. We must continue to fight for ALL working people. Mr. President, if you interfere with the Mueller investigation in contravention of the Constitution, I will file articles of impeachment. #ImpeachmeantIsNotDead #RepealandReplaceTrump Today, Texas Medical Center announced groundbreaking plans for #TMC3. I look forward to seeing these visionary and innovative strides fulfilled, further establishing Houston as the Third Coast for life sciences and biomedical research. https://t.co/HNPXfLNovx RT @TheRevAl: Texas @RepAlGreen talks Trump and Obama at the 2018 NAN Ministers Luncheon during #NANCONV2018 https://t.co/guQTGw3x2H I extend my sincerest condolences to the Bush family as we mourn the loss of #BarbaraBush. Although known for her virtue, poise, &amp; grace, it is First Lady Bush’s legacy of respectability that will be forever etched in the hearts &amp; minds of many Americans. https://t.co/pHcHdYNN68 Today @AnthonyCGraves shared his powerful story of how the justice system failed him, his family, &amp; his community. He served 18.5 years in prison, 12 years on death row for a crime his accuser committed. His story is appalling, but not unique. We need #criminaljusticereform now! https://t.co/z6ZdytqfXp By any name, the results remain the same. Supply side economics by @realDonaldTrump is a tax scheme for the rich and broken promises for the rest. #GOPTaxScam #TaxDay https://t.co/Rocgu5iF81 On this important historical and spiritual day, I want to extend the hand of friendship to our Sikh brothers and sisters by wishing everyone a happy #Vaisakhi. Today, I opened our FSC oversight hearing with the issues that should have our focus. The concerns of consumer advocates about changes at the CFPB. Wells Fargo. Fair Lending. Invidious discrimination. These are the issues that matter.
https://t.co/19sV50dZyD Dr. King’s untimely demise moved our nation to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which included the Fair Housing Act. That is why I am introducing H. Res 817 today to honor the brave Americans who sacrificed their lives for the right to affordable housing. #FHAct50
