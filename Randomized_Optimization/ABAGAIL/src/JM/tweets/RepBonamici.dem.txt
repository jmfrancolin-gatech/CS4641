Congress must act. The #RaiseTheWage Act is good for workers and good for the economy. The origins of a tipped minimum wage are deeply intertwined with the history of slavery in the US. Oregon is one of seven states that prohibit employers from paying tipped workers a subminimum wage. The #RaiseTheWage Act will gradually phase it out at the federal level. The majority of workers earning a minimum wage are women and people of color. The #RaiseTheWage Act will address these persistent wage gaps and allow workers to afford the ‚Äúbare necessities of life‚Äù as intended by the Fair Labor Standards Act. When workers are paid wages that leave them in poverty, they struggle to pay for rising rent, essentials like food &amp; transportation, and child care. In Washington County, a worker making the local min wage would have to work 73 hrs/wk to afford a one-bedroom apartment. Someone who works 40 hours per week at the fed minimum wage of $7.25/hr earns only $15,080/yr, putting a family of 2 below the federal poverty level. This is unacceptable.

#ShutdownStories I also heard from Robin in Beaverton, a proud Coast Guard mom with three sons and one daughter-in-law in the Coast Guard. If this shutdown continues, James will miss his pension check at the end of the month. But like many Coast Guard members I‚Äôve heard from, he‚Äôs not worried about himself: he‚Äôs worried about the young families who will be most hurt by missing a paycheck. 

#ShutdownStories I heard from James in Astoria, a retired #CoastGuard officer who served for 20 years. His family has a proud legacy of service in the Coast Guard: his father served during World War II and his son serves now‚Äîwithout pay. As the shutdown reaches its 27th day, I‚Äôm continuing to hear #ShutdownStories from families who are being hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. Many of them, including members of the Coast Guard, are continuing to work in critical positions without pay. I‚Äôm proud to join @RepKirkpatrick as a co-sponsor of the American Dream Employment Act. Dreamers should have the same opportunity as other qualified applicants to work in Congress. This institution and the people it serves would benefit greatly from their perspectives and talents https://t.co/fmmxy1KnNB RT @RepTjCox: At 11:30 today, I'll be holding a press conference, along with some of our 70 original co-sponsors, in front of the Capitol t‚Ä¶ Oregon‚Äôs commercial salmon fisheries were devastated in 2016 and 2017, when they saw more than a 70% decline in their salmon catch compared to the 5-year average. I'm pleased the House passed a disaster relief bill today that will provide additional funds for fisheries disasters. https://t.co/uLt5jy9tXA The President must immediately re-open the government; then we can discuss more effective border security solutions. #EndTheShutdown The government has been shut down for 26 days because Pres. Trump refuses to let go of his campaign promise to build a deeply-flawed wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. His stubbornness is harming hundreds of thousands of federal workers. 

#EndTheShutdown https://t.co/62P7CSMGyb The federal minimum wage has been stagnant for too long, harming working families and perpetuating income inequality. I am proud to stand with workers and join my colleagues in support of the #RaiseTheWage Act, which will increase pay for an estimated 40 million people. https://t.co/Y360Po89xf RT @EdLaborCmte: Today @BobbyScott and House Democrats introduce the Raise the Wage Act to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 20‚Ä¶ .@EPAAWheeler's work as Acting Administrator demonstrates that he doesn't understand the mission of the EPA. Thank you @ChrisVanHollen for reiterating the importance of protecting public health &amp; environment and standing up for EPA employees affected by the shutdown #StopWheeler It is outrageous that @EPAAWheeler couldn't make "further public comment" on #NCA4 when interviewing for a job as head of the EPA. His review was allegedly delayed because of the shutdown. @SenMarkey is absolutely right in stating that we are facing a #ClimateCrisis #StopWheeler Last year, I led 97 of my colleagues in calling on @EPAAWheeler to abandon plans to dissolve the EPA's Office of the Science Advisor. I'm glad @SenDuckworth brought up the fact that the Office of Children‚Äôs Health Protection currently lacks a director. #StopWheeler The latest @IPCC_CH report confirmed that consequences of inaction on climate change will be serious within our lifetime. @SenBooker is right - the EPA shouldn't be continuing to take regulatory action that "undermines the health and safety of our nation." #StopWheeler Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for highlighting the devastating effects of climate change in Oregon &amp; emphasizing @EPAAWheeler's denial of climate science. We need an EPA Administrator who will make climate change a priority. The future of our planet depends on it. #StopWheeler The evidence @SenWhitehouse shared demonstrates the significant conflicts of interest that @EPAAWheeler has as a former fossil fuel lobbyist. This nomination is another example of the Trump Admin doubling down on special interests instead of protecting the public #StopWheeler RT @NitaLowey: Democrats have offered numerous options to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; get the government back to work for the American people.‚Ä¶ @EPAAWheeler claimed that adaptation measures are the best way to respond to rising sea levels and wildfires are mostly caused by poor forest management. This is not consistent with the #NCA4 - which EPA scientists contributed to! #StopWheeler It is disgraceful that @EPAAWheeler does not agree with the scientific community that climate change is the greatest environmental crisis in the world. Thank you @SenSanders for mentioning that Wheeler didn't even say "climate change" in his opening statement. #StopWheeler .@SenatorCardin is right - Mercury and Air Toxic Standards have worked in protecting access to clean air &amp; water. @EPAAWheeler couldn't justify why rolling back these safeguards is necessary. I am glad that @SenatorCarper added the #NCA4 to the record. It is ridiculous that @EPAAWheeler refuses to acknowledge the scientific findings on climate change &amp; continues to propose rules that will increase emissions of dangerous pollutants and harm public health. #StopWheeler People across the country are being exposed to PFAS-contaminated water and soil. @EPAAWheeler couldn't even commit to having a drinking water standard for PFAS in the next two years. Thank you @SenatorCarper for emphasizing the urgency of this issue. #StopWheeler .@EPAAWheeler can try to paint efforts to rollback fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles as a positive step, but transportation is a major source of pollution in the country &amp; hazardous air pollutants disproportionately affect our most vulnerable communities #StopWheeler .@EPAAWheeler failed to mention that the EPA's own analysis found that the #DirtyPowerScam proposed rule to replace the Clean Power Plan will have negative effects on public health, leading to as many as 1,400 additional premature deaths per year. #StopWheeler .@EPAAWheeler may say that the EPA has worked to meet the deadlines set by the 2016 Toxic Substances Control Act, but the EPA has failed to protect Americans from asbestos. I'm working with @SenJeffMerkley to ban asbestos. #StopWheeler .@EPAAWheeler said that the "U.S. is the gold standard for environmental progress" but, because of actions by the Trump Administration, our country has fallen far behind the pledges made in the Paris Agreement and is unlikely to meet the targets set by 2025. #StopWheeler .@EPAAWheeler can claim he will protect public health &amp; the environment, but his actions as Acting Administrator prove otherwise. He has dismissed scientists, defended polluters, and ignored scientific evidence on climate change. #StopWheeler The Trump Admin putting forward Wheeler to run like the EPA is like giving the fox the keys to the henhouse‚Äî except our kids and grandkids are the hens. As Andrew Wheeler testifies at @EPWDems today, RT to #StopWheeler and show you won‚Äôt let the EPA be gutted without a fight. During a government shutdown, when federal employees at the @EPA are not getting a paycheck, Andrew Wheeler should not be considered for a promotion. At minimum, this hearing should be delayed until the government reopens. #StopWheeler Wheeler‚Äôs efforts to rollback and repeal protections will cause irreparable damage to our planet. He has attacked fuel economy standards, methane leak monitoring and repair requirements, landmark mercury and air toxic standards for power plants, clean water, &amp; more. #StopWheeler A former coal lobbyist who ignores science should not be leading the @EPA. I'm calling on my colleagues in the Senate to reject Andrew Wheeler's nomination. #StopWheeler RT @BobbyScott: There is no place in America where someone working full time &amp; making the $7.25 federal minimum wage can make ends meet. To‚Ä¶ A question about citizenship does not belong on the census. Today‚Äôs ruling is an encouraging step to make sure everyone participates in this important part of our democracy.
 
https://t.co/ljcIvIf5M9 The @DailyAstorian also shared compelling stories about Coast Guard families, including a family of 7, who depend on and need their paychecks. These servicemembers must be paid now. https://t.co/cVOmEnCUzL He says ‚Äúwhile I am sure you are voting to reopen the government I am asking you to please do everything you can to make it happen. There are people in a worse position than my family.‚Äù
