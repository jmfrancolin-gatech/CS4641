The #GreenNewDeal will have the federal government “overhauling whole industries.” The #GreenNewDeal will eliminate traditional energy sources “as soon as possible.” All #GreenNewDeal jobs are required to be “union jobs.” The level of investment to pay for the #GreenNewDeal is “massive.” The revenues of “every billionaire and company” in America “would not be sufficient” to pay for it. “A carbon tax may be a part of the Green New Deal” The #GreenNewDeal proposes building a high speed rail network across the country so that “air travel stops becoming necessary.” The #GreenNewDeal will “upgrade or replace” every home and business in the United States. The #GreenNewDeal will result in “a country that is trying to change how its economy works.” The #GreenNewDeal strives to “fully get rid” of air travel. The #GreenNewDeal guarantees economic security to people “unwilling to work.” All provisions and quotations are from the #GreenNewDeal outline released today by House Democrats https://t.co/ijki6PFjkI Here’s a thread of the Top 10 Most Alarming #GreenNewDeal provisions: Socialism disguised as radical environmentalism is still socialism.

I understand and share the President’s frustration over forest management policies in California, however we cannot withhold assistance to the victims of that mismanagement because of the actions of the state. We should always seek out steps that can prevent or minimize the impact of disasters, but while we have those discussions we must always provide aid to those in need.

Last March, Speaker Pelosi and 110 of her Democratic colleagues in the House voted to approve $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2018 for over 90 miles of physical barrier construction along our southern border. In October 2006, Congress approved the Secure Fence Act.  It passed the House 283-138 and later the Senate by 80-19.  Senators voting in favor included Sens. Obama, Biden, Boxer, Feinstein, Clinton, and Schumer. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208), which expressly authorized the construction and improvement of fencing and other barriers along the Southwest border. Constructing a physical barrier on our southern border has historically received bipartisan support. So why are Democrats now digging their heels in over a difference of $3.4 billion, which represents 0.26% of our discretionary budget, for something they’ve supported in the past?
