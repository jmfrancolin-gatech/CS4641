I will stand with @POTUS as a strong advocate for #TN06 for roads and other infrastructure. #SOTU Tonight, the Corcoran family, from East TN, is here at the #SOTU. Our hearts are with them as we remember their son, Pierce, whose life was tragically taken by an illegal immigrant. We must stand with @POTUS to end these senseless tragedies.  #AngelFamilies #BorderSecurity As long as we do not have a wall on our southern border, every state is a border state. It is far past time to end the flow of illegal drugs and criminals into our country.
