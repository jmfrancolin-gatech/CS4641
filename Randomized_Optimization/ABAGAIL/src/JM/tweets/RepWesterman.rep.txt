DHS reported arresting 17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records, and 6,000 gang members, including MS-13. Each year, criminal organizations gain $2.5 billion in profit from migrant smuggling. 1) Illegal drugs are streaming across the southern border. DHS Secretary @SecNielsen reports that in 2018, agents seized 282,000 lbs of cocaine, 248,000 lbs of meth, 6,500 lbs of heroin, and 2,400 lbs of fentanyl.
