Joe and I offer our sincerest condolences to you and your family during this difficult time. Today our national debt stands at $21,968,156,302,745 and growing.

Thank you for your service. Merry Christmas and God bless our troops! https://t.co/GarWmqljQz Busy day here in Washington, D.C.!

Now off to the House floor to vote! https://t.co/T8m2qmWNhr ...across the U.S. and Canada on airlines such as @Allegiant, @calpacificair, Flat Air, @FlySwoop, and @WestJet.

https://t.co/xBZ19zgIWR I joined my #Arizona colleagues in signing a letter to @USDOT @SecElaineChao and @FAANews urging funding for a new air traffic-control tower at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.

https://t.co/zsC0zkgyTU Thank you to Senators @JohnCornyn and @SenGaryPeters for supporting my efforts.
https://t.co/77b2wCpIcA I am thrilled my bill to secure our border by analyzing our ports of entry for threats and vulnerabilities is one step closer to being signed into law! With the rise of human trafficking, child smuggling, and the importation of illegal drugs, my bill will keep our citizens safe. 77 years ago, our nation came under attack at our U.S. Naval Base in #PearlHarbor, Hawaii.  2,403 service members and civilians lost their lives, including 1,177 on board the USS Arizona. May we never forget those who perished on December 7, 1941. #PearlHarborRemembranceDay https://t.co/6J8WTkmEax This recognition is based on ancient history and current political realities, and we must continue to voice that Jerusalem belongs to the people of Israel. I cosponsored a resolution commemorating the one-year anniversary of this momentous occasion.  (2/2) One year ago, President @realDonaldTrump made a historic announcement to recognize Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital and to relocate our embassy there. I applaud President Trump for standing up for one of our closest allies. (1/2) Today I attended the funeral service for President George H.W. Bush at the National Cathedral. It was a touching tribute to a patriot &amp; statesman who loved his country. I join a grieving nation in praying for his family &amp; loved ones as they say their final goodbyes #Remembering41 https://t.co/sJYCQmQ15S Are you signed up for my e-newsletter? Last week I shared photos from a bipartisan breakfast I hosted, my telephone town hall with #AZ08 constituents and the moment of silence on the House floor in honor of Congressman Ed Pastor. Visit my website for more‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/Ei8RpBcjma Great to meet with the Santagate family who was here for a Capitol tour, Rep. Elect Joanne Osborne in the Arizona House, and members of @NaifaArizona last week! https://t.co/NQjcfXzAtY I want to wish all those celebrating a #HappyHanukkah! May this eight-day Festival of Lights bring blessings of peace and joy upon you, your family, and loved ones. https://t.co/CpNaK9TAYI I pray the entire Bush family finds comfort knowing he is reunited once again with his wife, Barbara, before God. My thoughts and prayer are with his family, friends, and all Americans as we mourn the loss of the first President Bush. George H.W. Bush‚Äôs life exemplifies that of a public servant. As a World War II veteran, a member of Congress, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Vice President, and ultimately President of the United States, he was a true patriot and statesman. Just had a telephone town hall with thousands of #AZ08 constituents. 86% of the callers support President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs actions to secure the border. 71% do not support government-run healthcare aka ‚ÄúMedicare For All‚Äù. Thanks to all who participated in today‚Äôs town hall. https://t.co/teau1sygLk I hosted members of the Arizona delegation for a bipartisan discussion on how we can all work together and get things done for #AZ. Thank you to 
@RepAndyBiggsAZ, @RepDavid, @RepRubenGallego, Rep.-elect @gregstantonaz, Senator Kyl, Rep. @Ann_Kirkpatrick, &amp; @RepGosar for joining. https://t.co/wmU3caY7GW Congressman Ed Pastor, Arizona‚Äôs first Hispanic member of Congress, was a true public servant who spent decades working on behalf of Arizonans. His service to our state and our nation will never be forgotten. I send my sincere condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones. We cannot continue to put our national security and sovereignty at risk‚ÄîCongress needs to act to secure our border. That is why I cosponsored and voted for legislation that would build the wall and close these loopholes that continue to be taken advantage of. https://t.co/apicYlKKAW RT @SecAFOfficial: Beautiful footage of F-35s flying over the Utah Test and Training Range as part of a combat power exercise earlier this‚Ä¶ Congratulations to @NASAInSight on a successful landing on Mars today!

States like Arizona have a better understanding of how to manage their native wildlife. Today, the House passed H.R. 6784, a bipartisan bill to delist the gray wolf, which the @USFWS has deemed recovered under the Endangered Species Act. This will allow individual states to manage the species within their borders, not the federal government. Snowy morning today in the nation‚Äôs capital.
