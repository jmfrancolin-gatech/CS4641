Forest Service firefighters and even weather forecasters. More than 380,000 public servants will be furloughed - NASA, Nat’l Parks, HUD, DOT and others. There is no such thing as a ‘good’ shutdown. Even a partial shutdown costs taxpayers money. It inconveniences the public. And its certainly not fair to the federal public servants who would be directly affected.

And he articulates no plan or explanation beyond what he can fit in a wayward tweet. Let's be clear about what this means.

This year in particular, I cannot imagine a more worthy recognition – or journalists more deserving of it than @CapGazNews. https://t.co/fkhzGXp4FR "At other critical moments in our history, when constitutional crises have threatened our foundations, it has been the Senate that has stood in defense of our democracy. Today is once again such a time."

https://t.co/q3aqYtT5T6 RT @presidentloh: Congrats to @MarylandMSoccer and Coach @SashoCirovski! You make all Terps so proud!! https://t.co/fEYDprPi51 70 years ago today, shocked by the horrors of the Holocaust, the world recognized genocide as an international crime and established the #GenocideConvention. Because "never again" isn't a catchphrase; it’s a promise. America must always defend those who cannot defend themselves. Maryland, don't forget #OpenEnrollment is happening now – and ends next Saturday.

This weekend, @MarylandConnect is hosting #LastChance events across the state, where you can go and receive free, in-person help signing up for a 2019 #healthcare plan: https://t.co/qBKCFIoFId https://t.co/63FqQuZSyY Intimidation of U.S. diplomats is always unacceptable. The use of U.S. supplied equipment to do so is an added affront. I fully support @RepEliotEngel's call to withhold the transfer of additional military-style equipment to #Guatemala until we address the August 31 incident. https://t.co/d7AE7qcPKX Interesting discussion today with the dynamic team at Cornerstone Montgomery, the county's largest provider of behavioral health services. Learning about their remarkable progress in battling #OpioidEpidemic and finding well-paying, lasting jobs for their patients. Great work! https://t.co/vQuZXHTfby The anniversary of Pearl Harbor reminds us that America has always been a nation that turns anger into action, tragedy into triumph. Today we celebrate that, we honor our veterans, &amp; we recommit ourselves to using our strength to defend those who are unable to defend themselves. The Trump Admin wants to bury the National Climate Assessment report because it doesn't align with @POTUS' completely unhinged claim that #ClimateChange is a "hoax."

But ignoring facts never succeeds in making them any less true. And we can't afford to ignore them any longer. https://t.co/UdhUNZLtFJ Had a frank conversation w/ the University System of Maryland Board of Regents tonight. They know they made mistakes in their recommendation to retain former Coach Durkin. Now we’re here to move forward and work to address Title IX issues and the rise of hate across USM schools. https://t.co/bUYoRGrIZO Live now, #TeamMaryland provides a read out of our frank discussions w/University Systems of Maryland Board of Regen https://t.co/2fLqBma9ml RT @BrianFrosh: Our subpoenas are out in the #emoluments case. We are seeking documents from Trump businesses and government agencies that… Our national security is harmed, not helped, when dictators believe they can get away with heinous acts like extrajudicial killings – and continue to be supported by the U.S. My friends on both sides of the aisle understand this. @POTUS is the only one who doesn’t. #Khashoggi https://t.co/IwSIcBuuw8 I'm proud to officially cosponsor the First Step Act, a #CriminalJusticeReform bill that makes long overdue changes to our broken criminal justice system. The legislation has garnered overwhelming bipartisan support, and @SenateMajLdr should bring it up for a vote without delay. Maryland: Starting Tuesday, @MarylandConnect will be hosting #LastChance events across the state, where you can go and receive free, in-person help signing up for a 2019 #healthcare plan. A great chance to ask questions and explore options.

Details here: https://t.co/qBKCFIoFId https://t.co/O363dls2gE Thank you to @TMCF President @DrHLWilliams for a productive meeting this week on how to better serve Maryland HBCUs, including @BowieState @CoppinStateUniv @UMESNews and @MorganStateU. We can and must build on the progress we've made to support all our HBCUs and their students. https://t.co/ZSrNGAx3cc #WorldAIDSDay should be a day of sober commemoration, but also a day of hope. Success in the fight against HIV/AIDS is within our grasp, if we're willing to commit to it. @PEPFAR and @GlobalFund have done incredible, life-saving work, and I'll always be proud to support them. https://t.co/x3ASxugvwM Today marks #WorldAIDSDay, a day to remember all those we have lost to this disease, and to recommit ourselves to leading the fight against it. I'm proud and thankful that @PEPFAR reauthorization earned bipartisan support this week. American leadership on this must never waiver. https://t.co/9zr1CiXgzX America has lost a true public servant and a statesman. He understood the meaning of sacrifice and the need to put country before self. You did not have to agree with President George H.W. Bush to respect him and his love for our country. My condolences go out to his family. https://t.co/QKBNBlzwQJ Open enrollment for 2019 #healthcare plans ends December 15. That’s just two weeks away. Don’t wait. 

If you have questions or need help, @MarylandConnect will be hosting free, in-person #LastChance events where you can go and get hands-on assistance: https://t.co/E0BQGINBz8 In Frederick with the great people of @MarylandConnect, the Seton Center, HealthCare Access Maryland and the Frederick County Health Department. We’re here to remind you that #OpenEnrollment is happening NOW. https://t.co/2MZaVIY7Nd is your best resource to explore your options. https://t.co/Dr941mvB6j One of the best parts of my job: getting to meet with bright young people from all over Maryland. Today I have the pleasure of speaking with Frederick High School students about civic engagement. Thanks for letting me interrupt class — and for asking such smart questions. https://t.co/UHcm7geMRb Congress should have passed legislation protecting the Mueller investigation MONTHS ago. But recent events make such a bill all the more necessary and urgent.

Congress is designed to be a check and balance on @POTUS. Let's act like it. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/np0TaJBWzV Proud and grateful to report that @PEPFAR earned strong bipartisan support for its reauthorization. #PEPFAR has evolved to become one of the best, most effective tools we have in the fight against HIV/AIDS. It truly deserves the United States' ongoing support. https://t.co/goGP3ldUaj And Saudi Arabia has shown a total disregard for international law by leveling devastating attacks on civilians, including young children.

It's past time we refocus our efforts in Yemen. We need diplomatic solutions – and to remember that America's strength is in our values. Now I ask my colleagues to look beyond our direct military support to the role U.S. arms sales play in worsening the conflict. These sales cannot come at the expense of human rights, mass atrocities, and regional destabilization... Today I voted to end U.S. involvement in #Yemen. This conflict has become a humanitarian nightmare, with more than 10,000 killed and 22.2 million – nearly 75% of the population – at grave risk.

Morally, continuing our military involvement in this disaster is just not an option. RT @MeetThePress: "American foreign policy is strongest when we embed it in our principles and our values," says @SenatorCardin. #MTPDaily RT @MeetThePress: .@SenatorCardin: "It's in the interest of the Saudis to maintain a relationship with the United States.

It was a privilege to be part of this unveiling. This tool has the potential to help save countless lives, and serves as an important reminder that America's strength is rooted in our values and our capacity to do good. https://t.co/KKFPNFeuAc The First Step Act would limit mandatory minimum sentencing, increase inmates' access to rehabilitative services, and expand job training programs. The first of many steps toward a fairer system.

This bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support. @SenateMajLdr: let's get it done. Grateful to these Ravens players and execs for voicing support of the #FirstStepAct. By using your platform to support criminal justice reform, you give hope to countless Americans in Baltimore and nationwide who are caught in an often unjust system.

https://t.co/IhjlEcAoEw Once again Russia is failing to respect Ukraine's territorial sovereignty. Their intensifying aggression is another solemn reminder that Russia is not our friend, nor a friend to our allies.

We need real leadership from @POTUS. He must make clear that the US stands with Ukraine. https://t.co/gvQ0PFm0sW RT @MarylandConnect: Mental and behavioral health services are covered by qualified health plans sold through Maryland Health Connection. #… This news highlights the reality that our trade and economic policies have a real, human impact. Maryland families will be on the receiving end of this. Baltimore County's GM workers have been nothing but devoted, hardworking employees. I'll never stop fighting for them. .@POTUS' trade policies have hurt our workers and our businesses. Meanwhile, his promise that Republicans' tax cuts for corporations would lead to more jobs has proven patently false. This is the Trump economy at work. GM workers deserve so much better.

Join me in celebrating #SmallBizSaturday today, and #ShopSmall. This #SmallBusinessSturday, I got to #ShopSmall with Calvin Ball, new Howard County Executive. At Historic Savage Mill, we visited HorseSpirit Arts Gallery, recently displaced by flooding in Ellicott City. Proud to support #SmallBiz owners like Robin Holliday when I #BuyLocal. https://t.co/4pnKUHXm6g Happy #SmallBizSaturday! To all of Maryland's small business owners and workers: thank you for keeping our economy moving. 

I encourage everyone to #ShopSmall today, and throughout the whole holiday season. https://t.co/0HgX0RI8xN Climate change is real. Trying to bury this report on the Friday after Thanksgiving does not make it less urgent. #science https://t.co/BFpfCUn7FT There are more than 29 million small businesses in the United States, and they're responsible for nearly HALF of all jobs. 

Make no mistake: small businesses are the backbone of our economy. So let's show them our support.

I know what a sacrifice that is. America owes you tremendous gratitude and respect. May you be able to return home to your families soon. #HappyThanksgiving Today I give heartfelt thanks for the great honor of representing my home state in the U.S. Senate. Thank you, Maryland, for the privilege, and for every day being such engaged and thoughtful citizens.

America's national security is harmed, not helped, when dictators and strongmen believe they can get away with such heinous actions as extrajudicial killings.
