Joining @MorningsMaria on @FoxBusiness shortly. Tune in! Tonight, we were reminded of why we should all be proud to be American. 

Read my full #SOTU statement here https://t.co/6AhIblNDUi "We must keep America 1st in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny - that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all nations of the world!" @realDonaldTrump #SOTU "America was founded on liberty and independence - not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe." @realDonaldTrump  #SOTU "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation...We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU Finally heading to the Capitol to see @realDonaldTrump deliver his second State of the Union Address! #SOTU 

Tune in at 8pm CT on https://t.co/9xCSpTRuZG https://t.co/Oo3K7AoqgP Today’s the day! 

Tune in tonight for @POTUS second State of the Union Address and join the conversation with #SOTU https://t.co/3y2bJYiUoQ Thanks for having me! https://t.co/h1lpL0fO3f DEADLINE EXTENDED – My offices will be accepting Valentines for Veterans until Monday, February 11th. 

That means #MO03 has an extra week to take a moment and create a valentine for those who bravely served our nation! https://t.co/bPVT6cXDnV February is #AmericanHeartMonth ❤️

As your Congressman I will continue supporting heart disease research and funding to ensure Missourians continue to live long, happy and healthy lives. #NoMOHeartDisease #BlainesBulletin https://t.co/hXe0yxNY3W Keep them coming! Valentines for Veterans can be dropped off or mailed to my district offices in Wentzville, Jefferson City, and Washington until Monday, February 4th at 5:00 pm. 

Please visit my website for additional details https://t.co/bPVT6cXDnV https://t.co/wjPRyOuSMC With bitterly cold weather headed our way, I urge you to follow @MoSEMA_ and @Readygov for important information and safety tips. Stay safe #MO03! https://t.co/M0OaSnYk0J Data security and breach notification are some of my top priorities.

Divided government can only work if both sides show a willingness to compromise and negotiate in good faith. @realDonaldTrump has shown he is willing to work with Congressional Democrats on their immigration priorities, even in the face of continued Democratic obstruction. 46 years after Roe v. Wade, the pro-life movement is as strong and as passionate as ever.

This morning I spoke with #prolife Missourians who traveled to Washington DC to make their voices heard. https://t.co/PdooIzJLc8 Thanks for having me! https://t.co/CsmHYBMY8p The @usdafsa office in Jefferson City will be open on Jan 17, Jan 18, and Jan 22.

My press releases from 2009 sound like they were written today, a bleak reminder of how little has been done to #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/F67fV8dixp Today I reintroduced four bills that will make a real difference to coastal Americans as we continue to work toward permanent, comprehensive reform of the National Flood Insurance Program https://t.co/OqYkomBXqq https://t.co/KuTqfyI0c3 I’m thrilled to announce my 4th annual ‘Valentines for Veterans’ initiative today!

Replacing the aging bridge originally built in 1934, the new bridge will provide a vital link between Franklin and Warren counties. https://t.co/5wyGPS3oim Along with my fellow Americans, I send my sincere condolences to the entire Bush family on this difficult day. We all gain some comfort in knowing he is now reunited with his beloved wife, First Lady Barbara Bush. America has lost an honorable man who leaves a legacy of conservative leadership. President George H.W. Bush exemplified the Greatest Generation through his faithful commitment to our nation as a war hero, Congressman, Ambassador to the UN, Director of the CIA and President. Proud of my friend @PatrickMcHenry who will lead the @FinancialCmte Republicans with distinction. https://t.co/QU7U1y3jrl 500 MILLION customers may have had information exposed, including passport numbers and payment information in some cases.

On behalf of myself, my family, and my staff, I hope everyone has a safe, joyous, and blessed Thanksgiving! Missourians cherish the tradition of togetherness.

My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family today. https://t.co/olCgfgiThE For the first time in 32 years, #taxday is a day to celebrate! 

Out with the old, in with the new (simpler, fairer) tax code. The #taxcutsandjobsact repeals Obamacare’s unpopular and ineffective individual mandate. You will no longer be forced to buy health insurance you don’t want, don’t need, or can’t afford. You have the FREEDOM to buy the health care plan that’s right for you. The #taxcutsandjobsact will simplify taxes, with nearly 9 out of 10 Americans filing on a much simpler and more straightforward form. The #taxcutsandjobsact DOUBLED the child tax credit to help families across the country. It also preserves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Adoption tax credit. The #taxcutsandjobsact nearly DOUBLED the standard deduction, protecting more of your paycheck from taxes and simplifying the filing process. The #taxcutsandjobsact helps Americans keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. An average family of four in Missouri-03 will see a tax savings of $2,055! Missourians deserve better than a complicated and outdated tax code. Thankfully, we FIXED IT! Next year, hardworking families in Missouri and across the nation will find #taxday to be simpler and less time consuming. https://t.co/nvDrKxFvzK Tomorrow is the LAST day of our complicated and outdated tax code!
