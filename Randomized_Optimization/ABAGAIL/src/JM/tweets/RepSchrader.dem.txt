I am hopeful this will be the Congress we will be able to finally codify important #NetNeutrality protections for consumers. https://t.co/EFGTMCglSz Held a hearing this week in @EnergyCommerce on strengthening our health care system &amp; the decision in Texas v. US. The goal is to provide better health care and w/o ACA’s vital consumer protections, Americans could face skyrocketing premiums &amp; out of pocket costs #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Giuq9DF1ii Today, I visited with @TSA workers @NACTA members at @flypdx who have spent the last 35 days working without pay to keep airports safe and running. Happy that the government will be reopening and 9,600 of Oregon's hardworking federal employees will be receiving paychecks again. https://t.co/lzR6ht9GIe Today I sat down with local leaders in Clackamas County to talk about what’s happening in DC and how I can support their efforts at home. Thank you for everyone who came, and for sharing your stories about how the shutdown is affecting you and our community. https://t.co/tMunpW5k3B Roughly 9,600 federal employees in Oregon are being impacted by the current shutdown. I called on @USDOL to make clear that federal employees deemed “essential” - those working without pay - may be eligible for unemployment insurance. https://t.co/u3NSNbanmL The first bill I introduced this Congress was my Hold Congress Accountable Act because in any other profession in this country, if you don’t do your job, you don’t get paid. Congress should be NO different. https://t.co/Iyznt46iJN ICYMI: I joined @KATUNews this week to talk about my bill to reduce pay for Members of Congress during shutdowns. In any other profession, if you don't do your job, you don't get paid. Congress shouldn't be any different! https://t.co/yCJiJJBN0D I want to convey my deepest condolences to the crew of the Mary B II, their families, friends, and the whole community for their immense loss this week after the boat capsized crossing the Yaquina Bay Bar. And I want to thank the US Coast Guard for heroically assisting the boat. https://t.co/aIRx22INmx Met with TSA workers at PDX who have been working since December without pay because of this totally unnecessary partial government shutdown. I want to thank every TSA worker for their hard work over the past few weeks. Congress needs to do its number one job and pass a budget. https://t.co/AgOsoQl4QI Tune in to News Radio 1190 KEX at 12:30 while I speak to Mark Mason about what’s going on in Washington. https://t.co/f6maRfr2Mj As my first act this Congress, I reintroduced a series of government reform bills to increase transparency &amp; accountability, &amp; give a voice back to the people. Our democracy relies on the power in the voice of the people &amp; depends on a Congress that works. https://t.co/Ujc6HUSk3r https://t.co/YmWjp5sVRg Great to see the new @TillamookCheese visitor center today.

Don’t miss your chance, head to https://t.co/3xkYhX0xqc  today! https://t.co/CQPbbCVVcX Since OR's Global Warming Commission found last year that the bulk of carbon emissions in OR come from dead, diseased trees, it’s never been so clear that now is time for better forest management practices to reduce harmful emissions &amp; curb the threat that future fires may pose. .@nytimes is right: not just a lack of management, but mismanagement of our forests are making them so ripe for devastating fires, like the ones our neighbors in California have had to endure this season. https://t.co/J0JjRBM8mN Today, our country will come together to honor American servicemen and servicewomen for Veteran’s Day. We do not forget what our veterans sacrificed to protect our American values and our freedom. Thank you to all who have served, and happy Veterans Day! https://t.co/rRSlWeuA0B Public libraries are one of the most important resources for a local community. That’s why I worked with the United States Library of Congress and its surplus book program to help add to Mt. Angel Public Library’s collection. Thanks for what you do for the people of Mt. Angel! https://t.co/C7Rx9MoV4X The Benedictine Brewery and Taproom in Mount Angel Abby is one of only three breweries in the nation owned and operated by monks. Even in Oregon, the beer capitol of the world (some would say), this is special. Thanks for showing me around. https://t.co/cFM8v1BWNw As a veterinarian, I appreciate the work that Maria does at Silver Creek Lambscapes.

With perseverance and some outside-the-box thinking, they are helping families build homes they can afford. https://t.co/MT7SaWQjDL Today, I joined fishermen in Newport to talk about this industry which they have built over generations to be one of the most successful and sustainable in the world. As fishermen continue to innovate their industry, it’s important the government keeps up to ensure their success. https://t.co/CYyEONQbHR It’s been more than two years in the making, but we finally cut the ribbon on the Highway 101 improvement project in downtown Tillamook! Tillamook is also the home of new businesses!

https://t.co/9Lge1kIawx Today, I had the opportunity to talk with @ochspioneers AP History students about our political system and how they fit into it. Hearing from the next generation has always been a privilege in this job, and it's critical that they know the vital role their voice plays. https://t.co/QuFArnMrVo Thank you to the student at St. Paul High School who invited me to come speak in front of you and your classmates.

This group raises tens of thousands of dollars for the community each year with their events - thanks for the work that you do! https://t.co/jpOvwJQ2nq As Oregon’s cannabis industry continues to grow, it’s important that consumers know exactly what they’re getting. That’s where labs like @ChemHistoryLabs come in, which test to make sure that products are free of harmful chemicals so consumers can make safe, informed choices. https://t.co/QZj1tK8nPF Folks from the @WestLinnRotary are always giving back to their community whether it’s planting trees at Willamette Park or opening their home to an exchange student.

Although my bill to fix this was pulled, I will continue to fight for our veterans, like Alan, who deserve their retirements. https://t.co/JacEQJAKPV Between their work raising money for local high school scholarships and volunteering on projects throughout the community, it’s hard to know how these Milwaukie Rotarians find the time. Thanks for talking with me today, and for the work you do for this community. https://t.co/eAMVXiCpwN TMK Creamery’s philosophy is, “it all starts on the farm.” As a farmer, I couldn’t agree more.  This family owned, Canby dairy does it all from growing the grain to packaging the cheese.

Our state nut is really living up to its title. https://t.co/4M2PpPgkgZ With events like their lobster feed, which raises an incredible amount of money for charity, there is no denying that the Lake Oswego Rotary is a prime example of their motto, “Service Over Self.” Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today, it has been a pleasure. https://t.co/Ts8SLOlTpG We need changes to House rules like the proposal my bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus issued earlier this summer to give rank-and-file Members more power and control so the American people are actually represented. Read them here: https://t.co/MGzhkbAp24 As we approach leadership elections in the House, my support for our next Speaker will only go to someone who will put their focus on breaking the gridlock in Congress and working on solutions – whichever side of the aisle they come from – to the problems our country faces. Great day on the Molalla River with the Molalla River Alliance, @americanrivers @nfswildfish @TroutUnlimited @NWSteelheaders. Since I started in Congress, I have introduced the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to preserve the history and ecosystem of this magical place! https://t.co/SmBhEd5QBM Having the @mentor_graphics worldwide headquarters here in Wilsonville means a lot of jobs for Oregonians.

We have totally vacant leadership in Congress. Instead of taking impulsive and ridiculous, exploitative votes, we should do our job and take real bipartisan, thoughtful action on immigration. The men and women who work for ICE are not the problem and focusing in &amp; harping on the people who work at an agency is nothing more than a political stunt. There are real problems that need to be addressed like the horrendous policies by this administration that separate &amp; (1/2) I want to thank all the folks at @TheSpringsLvng for your time and your thoughtful questions.

This is unacceptable. The #EqualityAct would extend existing civil rights protections to LGBTQ people. #EqualityForward https://t.co/9NI86uCGY4 Let’s make one thing clear: yesterday the President didn’t fix the immigration problem &amp; this House is not fixing the problem today. https://t.co/o042enGl1C I also joined my Oregon colleagues to demand AG Sessions immediately reverse the administration’s zero-tolerance policy that’s left asylum seekers dumped in federal prisons like the one in Sheridan. Read our letter here: https://t.co/kdN3nqBgqj Today, I joined my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to demand a hearing into the child detention centers to get answers on family separation and the conditions at these centers. #KeepFamiliesTogether Read our letter here: https://t.co/8c3HGFR3Fn I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, along with more than 190 of my colleagues, to prohibit separating children from their parents at the border AND I've signed onto a resolution condemning this horrible policy. https://t.co/J5OJhKepkJ Great talking with the folks at the Capital Manor today. Thanks to all of you who came to chat with me about the issues that you see in the country and what I can do to serve you in the United States Congress https://t.co/Jrke4t9QtS Doing this doesn’t just go against every American value but every human value we hold. The President needs to end this horrific policy, which never should have been a policy to begin with, immediately! There is absolutely no reason to separate families or take small children away from their parents at the border. This totally unnecessary and cruel action calls to mind horrible decisions from history and it disturbs me to my core. I'll be hosting a telephone town hall this Wednesday at 6pm PDT.

Since the fall, I’ve been sharing the stories of Oregonians who are also Dreamers on the House floor because right now hundreds of thousands of young folks throughout our communities are being recklessly kept in a limbo of uncertainty and fear. #DreamActNow I signed on to the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act to require judicial review of any decision to fire an independent special counsel, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

There are common sense, bipartisan steps that we can take to curb &amp; prevent this from continuing to happen. We can start with background checks, holding hearings on gun violence, and conducting federal research into this epidemic. It's been moving &amp; humbling this week to see the brave students from Parkland become so active, but the reality is that parents should be able to take their children to school each morning knowing that they will come home safely that night. This epidemic should not be happening. Thanks to everyone who came to my Lincoln County Town Hall tonight. There is an incredible amount of engagement in this political moment, and together we can take that energy to Washington and make real changes for our communities. https://t.co/s598WN3lqi On this day in 1859, Oregon became the 33rd state in the Union. More than 150 years later, we still boast some of the best natural beauty in the county. Happy Birthday to Oregon! https://t.co/gA9ClNe1MU Oregon has a long tradition of dairy farming, and it was a pleasure to meet with the Oregon Dairy Farmers Assn to talk about their priorities for the upcoming Farm Bill. Working together, we can ensure that this industry is successful for generations to come. https://t.co/XJFTFlHgqo There are so many critical issues in Polk County, I appreciate everyone who joined me at my town hall in Dallas to talk about what’s most important to you. https://t.co/QMsPxEcZai Thanks to Mayor Figley and all the local leaders from Marion and Polk Counties today who joined me to talk about how I can work to serve them in Washington. https://t.co/YQnKA0AFQ1 There’s an incredible amount of activism happening in Tillamook County, and I appreciate all of you who took the time to join me at my town hall this weekend. https://t.co/a5bKpJtK76 Thank you to all the students who came today to learn about the United States Service Academies and how they can attend them. It’s incredible to see the amount of young people who are driven to get an education in service of this country. https://t.co/71AMtJiCyh Town halls are the most effective way for me to talk directly with my constituents. Thanks to everyone in Clackamas County who showed up this morning to make your voices heard! https://t.co/xtlPHMAImo Today, I added my name to my colleague Rep. Doyle’s legislation (CRA) that would overturn the FCC’s recent order to roll back #NetNeutrality. As I’ve said, Oregonians overwhelmingly support enforceable protections to ensure an open internet and so do I. I’m honored to have Juan join me at the #SOTU tonight. Juan is an impressive young Oregonian &amp; I’m committed to make sure he, and every Dreamer in this country, has the opportunity to fulfill his and her dreams here at home. https://t.co/b9q7Qj5Wge Last March, I introduced my bipartisan Hold Congress Accountable Act which would reduce the salary of Members of Congress for the duration of a shutdown. Because in every other profession, if you don’t do your job, you don’t get paid. Why on earth should we be any different? https://t.co/yYL8MDE2ev My town hall in Polk County originally scheduled for tomorrow, Monday the 22nd, has been rescheduled.

My statement on the yet another barebones, unnecessarily politicized two-week funding bill: https://t.co/1EIsn2QktL Four years ago I met three Marine Corps combat vets who wanted to make a space for people to come together by opening a brewery.  With that idea, they created @VagabondBrew to bring “Beer. Love. Adventure” to the community.  Thank you for your continued service. https://t.co/P4eUTI2rFB Thanks to all who came out to see Senator Merkley and me today to talk about the issues that matter to you most.
