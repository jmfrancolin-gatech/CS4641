On National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we must redouble our efforts to eradicate the scourge of human trafficking once and for all: https://t.co/2Pgvbj2RDv https://t.co/BgdZBgniiM My Frederick Douglass anti-trafficking bill is now the law of the land. It authorizes over $430 million, over 4 years, to fund a whole-of-government effort to fight this heinous crime which targets mostly women and children. Read about it here: https://t.co/fe1JDmqfTW Today @PostOpinions published my op-ed “The world must stand against China’s war on religion,” focusing on President Xi Jinping’s efforts to forcibly bring religion under Communist Party control—the “sinicization” of religion. Read the op-ed here: https://t.co/SoujoJLuiX With many details yet unknown, our hearts are broken for the victims of the mass shooting of a Jewish congregation during Saturday morning worship at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. https://t.co/TSwea0zUb3 Today I joined hundreds of family members and supporters of Alzheimer’s patients in Pt. Pleasant Beach at the 2018 #WalktoFightALZ, hosted by Alzheimer’s New Jersey: https://t.co/vQoXbD6lPa https://t.co/mnNYjI40Rt Marie and I joined thousands at the National Cathedral today to say goodbye to John McCain, a great patriot and American hero. All the tributes were extraordinarily moving, including those by Presidents Bush and Obama. Our hearts and prayers are with Cindy and the entire family. Senator John McCain was an extraordinarily brave and noble man—a hero—a dedicated husband, father, fighter pilot, and an amazing lawmaker. My full statement: https://t.co/ccEmp2OesB https://t.co/W07Ht6URYA On the shootings at Trenton Art All Night: https://t.co/irmWWHxi3z RT @usosce: U.S. congressman &amp; @HelsinkiComm co-chair @RepChrisSmith addressed diplomats, civil society &amp; others by video today at @OSCE co… Today’s new CDC numbers on autism regrettably show a greater prevalence—up 20% in NJ to 1 in 34 kids.  This quantifying of prevalence of autism—mandated by my legislation—helps us fight for &amp; secure much-needed fed support for treatment &amp; education of children w/ autism. This morning, I spoke at the signing of the STOP Offshore Oil and Gas Act by Gov. Murphy, in Point Pleasant Beach: https://t.co/3jcAXiMW5Z My statement on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a woman full of grace: https://t.co/IQ7eGcRmVf The @HumaneSociety yesterday awarded me as a Legislator of the Year. I have long supported proper funding and strong enforcement of animal welfare laws, and we must ensure that any and all horrifying abuse and exploitation of all types of animals is stopped. https://t.co/PD3iIzUaZy Provisions of my Kevin and Avonte’s Law helping children w/ autism &amp; seniors w/ Alzheimer’s were signed into law as part of the Omnibus. Read more about it here: https://t.co/f1FWfBw2AR and here: https://t.co/bhPgsXwEao Met w/ students from Freehold Township HS before their #MarchForOurLives rally &amp; discussed my strong &amp; long-standing support for common sense gun legislation. What happened in Parkland must never happen again--there is no higher priority for us right now than school safety. https://t.co/1vW0h7qDQO The funding of the Gateway Tunnel in the omnibus is an important start. I will fight to ensure the fed gov keeps its promise. Time is of the essence here. Was happy to host students from Hamilton HS West for a tour of the US Capitol during #PublicSchoolsWeek. We had a good conversation on trafficking and other issues, and I was impressed with the depth of their questions. I am proud of our schools and all our bright students! https://t.co/fN0XPETDTT During #NationalWalkoutDay, the House adopted an important school safety bill, HR 4909, that I cosponsored. There is no higher priority right now than the safety of our students—we must do all we can to protect tomorrow’s leaders today. Today's ruling against the monster power line proposed for Monmouth County was a victory for safety &amp; economic concerns of local residents; I opposed this project for those very reasons. Rachael Kanapka &amp; her group RAGE were rock stars in fighting this project. W/ so many rail passengers crossing daily b/w NJ &amp; NYC &amp; the tunnel in need of repair, the time to build the Gateway Tunnel was yesterday. The House approved $900 mil. It’s time for the Admin to do its part &amp; cover half the costs. The internet should not enable human trafficking, &amp; those complicit must be held accountable. I was proud to co-sponsor The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 to crack down on this abuse. The Senate should act quickly to pass this critical bill. Met w/ @SecretaryZinke to discuss NJ offshore drilling. I &amp; other NJ members were clear about it: not now, not ever. The Secretary heard our concerns, &amp; the meeting was encouraging. If the proposal for New Jersey is not already off the table, it will soon be. Our hearts and prayers go out to all the victims, survivors and family members at today’s deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS in Parkland, FL. Thanks to the first responders, police and medical personnel who moved swiftly to help the wounded and save lives. Today I joined, via Facetime, NJ citizens rallying in Hamilton against the Administration’s offshore drilling proposal. I am unequivocally opposed and am working with local citizens and colleagues to make it clear: not here, not now, not ever. https://t.co/oU62GrXPVW Viewed 25 student-created apps today at Point Pleasant Borough HS, including “Lunch Buddy,” the winner of the NJ-04 2017 Congressional App Challenge.  I was impressed by the creativity and technological proficiency of the STEM program students—tomorrow’s leaders are hard at work. https://t.co/b2cxavTR1K Watching the news about the train collision carrying my Republican colleagues and staff as I fight the flu.  Hope those injured recover quickly. I was pleased that the President last night reported new jobs &amp; rising wages &amp; emphasized support for paid family leave, the need to rebuild our infrastructure, address the opioid epidemic, &amp; establish accountability at the VA. Both parties in Congress must address these issues. Today is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. The suffering of more than 25 million trafficking victims worldwide—who are mostly women and children—must spur us to work even harder for their rescue, for the prosecution of traffickers, and to end this cruelty. I am unalterably opposed to the Secretary of the Interior’s proposal to open up coastal waters to oil and gas exploration and drilling. This poses serious risks to NJ’s beaches and commercial fishing industry. https://t.co/2MEpvMklpt https://t.co/iMlgCsNQe3 I continue to oppose the current tax bills because of the negative impact on New Jersey and will vote No today While I believe Americans are overtaxed and need relief, I must vote “no” this week on the tax bill, H.R. 1, because of its negative impact on both New Jersey and my congressional district. https://t.co/EFVpyTKtXB Spoke at a sobering ceremony opening the “Journeys Beyond Genocide" exhibit at Brookdale College yesterday, honoring victims &amp; survivors of three different genocides.
