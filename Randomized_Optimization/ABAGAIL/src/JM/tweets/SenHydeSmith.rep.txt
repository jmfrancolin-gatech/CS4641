Always a pleasure to visit with folks from the MS Gulf Coast. @VisitMSCoast https://t.co/qsTzhZ5yRd Great to visit today with Cala Tabb, a farmer from Eupora, who's in DC for a @FarmBureau issues advocacy conference.

Praying everyone will be safe--now and as the nation mobilizes to help with relief and recovery. https://t.co/dKOOY1uUai Head, Heart, Hands &amp; Health...Happy National @4H Week! Celebrate a wonderful, character-building organization. @Mississippi4H @MSUExtService https://t.co/UW5fqt6x5Z This is a historic day.  I think Brett Kavanaugh will be a great Supreme Court justice and serve our nation well.  Now let's move forward on a positive note. #JusticeKavanaugh https://t.co/gho9fPqHph #BrettKavanaugh earned my vote. I believe he will be a justice whose adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law will be a credit to the Supreme Court and all Americans, https://t.co/MNWHGPbRd0 https://t.co/KJsGfn01Xf Amid all the furor of this week, it was a true treasure to visit with De’Nahri Middleton of Jackson. This brave young man's "Kidney Man" will be featured on the American Kidney Fund’s 2019 @KidneyFund calendar. https://t.co/NOUnzW3XDS An early morning with Senate presiding duties, followed by a visit with @ffweekend to discuss upcoming confirmation vote on Judge #BrettKavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/ax77KLSVsY .@SenatorCollins delivered a powerful speech in favor of confirming Judge Kavanaugh. The Senate is moving toward a confirmation vote tomorrow. I'll be presiding early Saturday morning. #ConfirmKavanaugh https://t.co/QAdINMlO5y #ConfirmKavanaugh  My statement: https://t.co/bvTfcCxBob https://t.co/kczLeGdthl What better news to celebrate #NationalManufacturingDay: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent in September--the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. Mississippi manufacturers can be proud to be part of this progress! #MFGDay18 https://t.co/oJ5RziPFYX RT @SenatorWicker: Today @SenHydeSmith, @CongPalazzo, and I announced an $11.2M RESTORE Act grant for the Mississippi Gulf Coast Water Qual… .@SenatorWicker &amp; I enjoyed a meeting with Mississippi and Yazoo-MS Delta Levee board members this week. Great to have the benefit of their views on moving forward after @POTUS signed the FY19 @USACEHQ funding bill which will assist MS ports and flood control efforts. https://t.co/HtZJPnraev Congress completes major legislation to help states and communities fight the #OpioidEpidemic.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of Brookhaven Officers James White and Zack Moak. New @USNavy contract underscores the significant role our Mississippi shipbuilders will have in rebuilding our military. Read more here: https://t.co/8LZYxMsBks https://t.co/RqOHrrANoH Enjoyed a productive meeting with @ComdtUSCG Schultz today, and appreciate the @USCG seal for my office. I'm grateful for the Coast Guard's influence in Mississippi and its good work on #HurricaneFlorence relief. https://t.co/VFzLpf2qTD It is time to bring Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation to a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. He has earned my support. The confirmation process should be comprehensive, detailed, and allow nominees to prove their worthiness... It should not be a weapon to use against a qualified nominee whose life has been given in service to our country’s laws, the judiciary, and the American people. It seems opponents of Judge Kavanaugh are engaged in character assassination to destroy the reputation of a devoted public servant and a loving husband and father. I, for one, will not stand by and watch it happen. Video link here: https://t.co/VAhEUzkFRE https://t.co/A4sSWyYkGf Enjoyed sharing with them how I took part in Mississippi's first @RelayForLife, which was on the @USMGoldenEagles intramural fields. https://t.co/vN2sB4I2rt I applaud everyone who volunteers and supports the @AmericanCancer Society. Thoroughly enjoyed a recent visit with Mississippians here with the American Cancer Action Network.  Keep up the good work! https://t.co/S6AOxDyO9e What an honor to meet some of the courageous families at the @TAPSorg Gold Star Families event today to commemorate ‘Gold Star Families Remembrance Week.’ I’m so grateful for those servicemembers and their families who have given so much for our freedom. https://t.co/VZ0hmLfw6B Sexual assault of any kind is unacceptable, but it is becoming very apparent that a major partisan effort is underway to undermine not just Judge #BrettKavanaugh’s nomination, but his character. My statement: https://t.co/f4otSoZS6b Visit this @USArmy site for Gold Star survivors: https://t.co/JwK8lOq1lG Gold Star Families Remembrance Week, Sept. 23-39. Take time this week to honor families whose loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice defending our great nation. #ThankYou #GoldStarFamiliesRemembranceWeek #GoldStarMothers https://t.co/UtZtl8j38r https://t.co/4P8lFqrrkx On #POWMIARecognitionDay, we especially remember those servicemembers held captive as a #POW and those who never returned home. We also pray for their families who were forever changed by their ultimate sacrifice. #YouAreNotForgotten https://t.co/inNjQk3wGo Persistence and team work are key achieving good things.
