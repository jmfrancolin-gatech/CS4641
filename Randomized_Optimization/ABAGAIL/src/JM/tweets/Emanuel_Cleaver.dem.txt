I cannot believe you forgot about ME!! I’m a leader. I’m a divider. What about me? I’m the biggest grifter there is, I have people believing questioning my garnishment is racist!! #RedWaveRising2018 #RedWave2018 @KressFCambers can’t beat me!! #mo5thdistrict #kcmo #KcLive https://t.co/tKwAvVLZYp @IanCeraolo @letamericavote Good job kids. Keep the dem elite white, while we keep poor blacks towing the line and voting democrat. @CarlHigbie @DonaldJTrumpJr @NancyPelosi @MiaNPhillips @GOPChairwoman @kilmeade Leave my old people alone. I know she isn’t black, but as a fellow liar and con artist we are birds of a feather. #VoteThemOut2018 #VoteThemOut #NAPS2018 #flocktogether @charliekirk11, @RepMaxineWaters and I like old people naps. We don’t care about anyone but the ones who know their place and cast those blind votes for us every two years. My pay has been garnished for four years and they still elect me. #NAPS2018 #Republicans #VoteThemOut https://t.co/Ba6A1Qb6Kt Good Job @Cheesecake! You get them back where they need to be we can’t have anyone running off @RepBobbyRush @RepMaxineWaters and me we are sure to keep that voting block safe and secure in squalor while thinking the #Republicans are the true racists. #demlies #RedWaveRising2018 https://t.co/XjYYtwryYR This is what meanness is, trump. Not the black caucus, who called me an Uncle Tom and worse for supporting Clinton instead of Obama. Only white people i don’t like can be mean. #naps2018 #mo5thdistrict #mo5th #demlies #payyourbills https://t.co/pGGmElvOro That’s right!! @RepMaxineWaters we can have people believing this make America great again stuff. @realDonaldTrump can’t lead our voters off ain’t gonna be NO running off. We’ve got naps to take, like old people. #RedTide #RedWave2018 #RedWaveRising #naps2018 #mo5thdistrict #ca43 https://t.co/3TCriiLLUf @thomas37361 I have some friends that resemble that comment here. Can’t say their names, you know because I like breathing. But their name rhymes with glinton.... @realkareemdream what about me, @RepBobbyRush and @RepMaxineWaters? We fight (nap) for our people. Don’t forget because every two years we prove that #WeAreUrbanAmerica. #RedWaveRising2018 #RedNationRising #RedWave2018 ain’t got nothing on us #mo5thdistrict #MO5 #ca43 https://t.co/cce9vQQnqX @justice4all444 @realkareemdream @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump Good job. Stay where you are. We like that so auntie @RepMaxineWaters and I can take naps while forgetting all of you little people. #naps2018 #RedWaveRising #Trump #mo5thdistrict #kc #IamUrbanAmerica #demlies Bro, @MayorSlyJames, myself, @letamericavote, and @RepMaxineWaters keep the urban vote in our hands Can’t have no one running off Get back to where we can control you &amp; #IamUrbanAmerica. @KressFCambers and @RealOmarNavarro are trying to take people away. #RedWaveRising #demlies https://t.co/CnLrWwwqeH @MayorSlyJames Love NYC, love the east coast. Why do I need to come back to KC? I don’t do anything for them anyways. Lol. @RepLaurenArthur glad to have your back. I too have insane donors from outside my district. So much money ($102,850 for you). Wait until you get to the big time. #Democrats @MoDemParty #BlueWave2018 #donation #notcompletelyillegal #bigmoney #specialinterest @MoLawyersMedia I support everyone voting as long as they vote for me and my friends. @MayorSlyJames and @letamericavote ensure that their agenda, the streetcar, will pass since they put ridiculous hurdles in the voters path @KressFCambers #Democrats #DemocratsBeingDemocrats #naps2018 #kc #KCMO https://t.co/jTfhbeaqAr @JasonDKander and @MayorSlyJames we cannot have this agenda. Our people don’t dontate. We have to have guilty rich people that feel like they are helping our voters who, as long as they stay in place, we never help. #kc #KCMO #Democrats #biglie #RepresentationMatters #naps2018 https://t.co/PCuXHBP9Rf @MaxinePWaters @MaxinePWaters, baby. Come out of your senile delusion and help us, the members of the black caucus, take advantage of our constituents. #naptime #USHOUSE #congress #cali43 #mo5thdistrict #blackcaucas  #BlackTwitter @MayorSlyJames got my votes though. He assured me so no primary, I will be around sometime in November, not the whole district though, I’m homesick for DC. #KCMO #Elections2018 #politics #FoxNews #ecIIbvld #gerrymander #naptime https://t.co/uRLyHtJmQs Wyclef said it best
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November. . .January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
#mo5thdistrict #RepresentationMatters @kanyewest I too received criticism for thinking freely or also known as accepting money to win over the black vote from the 1st black pres. #notmyfirstchoice #mo5thdistrict #blackcaucas #BlackHistory365 but I expect the black vote, can’t no one be running off. #mo5thdistrict @RealOmarNavarro do you really think you can, how do the kids say it “Step to my girl” @MaxinePWaters? We got our vote on lock. We don’t even have to campaign, but it would look weird if I had a bunch of money for doing nothing. Oh wait. I do. #RedWaveRising2018 is a joke It’s an oldie, but a goodie. Remember lawyers and realtors are MY donors, why? Because I support policies that hurt you and make them rich, and you vote for me anyways. #colormedemocrat #kc #kcmo #mo5thdistrict #DemDiv2018 #house #RepresentationMatters https://t.co/tNVdFOReWp @MaxinePWaters we should consider just staying in DC this election cycle. Our people are going to vote for us anyways. Why waste our time, then they would think we care too. We gots our naps to take! @RealOmarNavarro and @KressFCambers don’t have a chance! #fixed #mo5thdistrict Thank the maker this didn’t happen in DC, then I would care about the plight of the area that has my street. Don’t worry KC, I will come home this summer so you remember me. #kc #mo5thdistrict #RepresentationMatters https://t.co/IlAi0sCc3E @JasonDKander @SlyJames @MayorSlyJames @KCIAirport @MaxinePWaters I know @MaxinePWaters we have long meetings together about how best to serve our constituents. By that I mean long naps in our offices on the phone so people don’t bother us. #RepresentationMatters #mo5thdistrict can’t #dethronecleaver if I’m sleeping on it. @MayorSlyJames I stopped an interstate while I was mayor, step up your game. https://t.co/843UeCIIsx #mo5thdistrict #kc #kcmo #cronyism @JasonDKander @SlyJames @MayorSlyJames @KCIAirport Kind of like Ted Stephens in Alaska. Never been. Heard they have kangaroos and Koalas. #DemocratsBeingDemocrats @RepBobbyRush man I forgot to post the article. #garnishments #BlueWave2018 #paywhat #judgment #Chicago #KC #KCMO #ec2blvd https://t.co/7stl0xZcpq @JasonDKander @MoDemParty @RepBobbyRush, I know how it feels, but we are Dems, they aren’t getting rid of us. We die and then be able to vote for our successor. #dethronecleaver what? #Democrat #BlueWave2018 #KC #KCMO #mo5thdistrict #kcmayor #kcstreetcar @SlyJames fix the vote!cant have any running off Ain’t life grand I don’t even have to set foot in the city or walk down the crime ridden street that bears my name to get voted in office #Democrats #BlueWave2018 #mo5thdistrict they think they can #dethronecleaver? HA You’ll vote for me No. Matter. What. @SlyJames @JasonDKander @KressFCambers you are probably the better candidate, but I am better funded. @SlyJames will provide the votes and @MoDemParty has lawyers that will fund my campaign so I have a paycheck to pay that garnishment judgement. #mo5thdistrict #kc #kcmo #dethronecleaver #ec2blvd
