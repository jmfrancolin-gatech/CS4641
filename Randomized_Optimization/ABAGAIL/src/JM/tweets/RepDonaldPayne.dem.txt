Here's a clip from yesterday's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing. I asked Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti about the future of ports and how to build good-paying jobs that can't be offshored. 

https://t.co/KXXZzJGBPs Yesterday's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing was productive. It was an overdue conversation about how our nation can — and must — move forward with rebuilding our nation's infrastructure. Thanks to all the witnesses and to my colleagues. https://t.co/rrf0zC6aXq John Dingell was a giant in the House. He fought fiercely for his constituents. He helped bring health care to millions of Americans. And he was a riot on Twitter. May he Rest In Peace, and may my colleague @RepDebDingell find peace and strength at this time. It was a privilege to join #DominicansOnTheHill. Put the Trump administration on notice—we will fight the discriminatory citizenship question in the Census. We will stand up for public school and DREAMers and fair immigration. We are stronger because of our diversity! https://t.co/3W5s38aXg9 Today is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. If you haven't yet, get tested. Talk to your doctor.

We discussed maternal mortality, gun violence, the opioid crisis, and more. I’m grateful for their work. https://t.co/LetHKIe2lC Thanks to @MayorOfLA @ericgarcetti for describing the national importance of port innovation and interdependency. Port Newark is vital for the federal economy, and its success is reliant on the success of national infrastructure networks. The Gateway Project is a nationally important project. A fifth of the national GDP is inextricably tied to the project’s success. https://t.co/lFJrd595ui Secretary LaHood is a wonderful man who has done great work for the country. And he is still leading on transportation topics. It’s great to work with him to invest in America. https://t.co/ku7W8M8qT3 The Northeast Corridor Commission estimates that service disruptions caused by infrastructure failures, rail traffic congestion, and more costs the U.S. economy $500 million per year in lost productivity. My constituents deserve investments and answers. #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/F0xyfl6vvU America’s infrastructure was once the envy of the world, but today it is losing its battle against time, growth, and climate change. We need to take a bold, new approach — and we need to make the Gateway Project a reality. #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/rpKKYfcckX I’m in the @TransportDems hearing listening to former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood discuss the need to rebuild America’s infrastructure. https://t.co/yixBeoIXn0 Today, starting at 9:30 a.m., the @TransportDems will host a hearing on The Cost of Doing Nothing: Why Investing in Our Nation's Infrastructure Cannot Wait.

Tune in on CSPAN or https://t.co/97RZfa4UgX around 1:50. https://t.co/1TrKzFE3Sj Last night's State of the Union Address demonstrated the President's profound lack of self-awareness. #sotu My statement is online at https://t.co/6hFDJVflDR https://t.co/wVB7WM0Rul RT @RepEscobar: He lies. @POTUS is once again lying and using the #SOTU address to spread falsehoods about our beloved city of El Paso.

We need to pass HR1 to modernize our electoral system and make voting free for all Americans. #SOTUResponse Thank you, @staceyabrams, compassion at the border is not the same as open borders. Yes. And yes, we need a twenty-first-century immigration policy that shows the best of us. #SOTUResponse Now comes @staceyabrams, who will present a real vision of unity and freedom for all People. She’s a star with a lot to say. Tune in! Thanks, @RepValDemings. The President should come to the table to help end the scourge of gun violence. He should stand up to the #NRA. https://t.co/FfXEhnTgr5 The American soldiers who liberated Dachau and other concentration camps are truly among the best representatives of freedom in our nation. Thank you! #sotu Happy Birthday, Judah! I am so honored by your presence. May your life be long and fulfilling! #sotu Wait, when neo-Nazis marched in #Charlottesville, @realDonaldTrump said there were “some very fine people” on both sides. He’s gaslighting us. #sotu For America to truly be free, we must free the vote, protect our institutions, shore up our voting systems, fight corruption, and work #ForThePeople. Democrats have a bill for that. https://t.co/VnLsnsWXbv RT @TheRealBuzz: Proud to serve! #USA https://t.co/aXAOaWAz2D RT @RepBarbaraLee: President Trump’s record on HIV has been abysmal.

And she’s from New Jersey! #sotu Here’s hoping the President is ad libbing a new policy to boost HIV/AIDS funding globally. #sotu https://t.co/iN8VdwD5FW Democrats for the past two years have had a plan to reduce drug prices #ForThePeople. In the spirit of unity, I hope my Republican colleagues get on board. #sotu https://t.co/OuRm2oljLt Infrastructure investments must include funding for the Gateway Project, which is a linchpin for the economic development of the East Coast. #sotu Also, does @realDonaldTrump not realize that it’s his terrible policies and divisiveness that sparked a record number of women to run for (and win) seats in Congress. He has no self-awareness. More women in Congress than ever before—almost all Democrats. I wonder why? Is Mexico going to deliver a giant cardboard check for your wall, @realDonaldTrump? I doubt it. Go somewhere else with that. A wall is not a compromise. It won’t make us safe. #sotu Wait, is it a wall or a steel barrier? Will it be a fence tomorrow? Hot air the next day? #sotu A wall? Keep dreaming! When Trump talks about border security, remember the children he ripped from their mothers and the cages they were put into. That’s his idea of security. #sotu RT @RepJimmyGomez: Despite what you heard in the #SOTU, there is no “national crisis.” 

Undocumented immigration has been decreasing for Y… The vast majority of drugs cross legal ports of entry. A stupid wall won’t help. What border agents want and need is technology to better detect drugs in vehicles, manpower, and funding. #SOTU I don’t live behind a wall or gate. I live on the street I grew up on—in Newark, New Jersey. @realDonaldTrump obfuscates to stir up hate for immigrants. No one wants open borders, but the American People don’t want a wall. They want smart, evidence-based border security. #SOTU The President’s use of our nation’s military as political pawns is disgraceful. When he says “we’ve heard” about caravans, he means he watched Fox News today. Shame! #SOTU Instead of working constructively to address our immigration challenges, the President is making them worse. Democrats, on the other hand, want to work on a bipartisan basis to #protectDREAMers, #saveTPS, and pass #CIR. #SOTU How’d that work out for Nixon? https://t.co/Cx17AXgALE Protecting the Mueller investigation is a bipartisan issue. We will protect the investigation so truth can come to light. #sotu .@realDonaldTrump says that we are winning, but he must forget the 800 thousand federal workers who didn’t get paid for a month while he shut down government over his ignorant wall. That wasn’t winning. That was cruelty. RT @PhilipRucker: Trump said in SOTU, "We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution."

Democrat like me want to strengthen Obamacare because people should have better access to healthcare in the wealthiest country on earth. #sotu Make no mistake, the Trump #TaxScam was a massive giveaway to the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class. #sotu From enacting his #GOPTaxScam that favors the wealthy to shutting down the government, President Trump’s economic policies are failing the middle class. RT if you agree. #SOTU https://t.co/IMCYiCrV1G .@TheRealBuzz was a childhood hero of mine. I followed his trip to the moon with wonder. His service to country is exemplary, and I salute him!

But it's not just about where we've come from . . . it's about where we are going. Together, we write history. https://t.co/H9YWRJ3YfA @realDonaldTrump You really don’t understand how to negotiate, do you? @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You have the nation’s intelligence and homeland experts at your disposal, yet you rely on television for your briefings. Media moguls can manipulate you. Sad and dangerous. We have to work hard to stamp out hate and bigotry—today and every day. On this #HolocaustMemorialDay, let’s join together to honor the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust. And let’s continue to pray for peace around the planet. I'm happy to announce that I'll be serving on three Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittees, which will allow me to keep fighting for the people of New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District. My statement is below. https://t.co/mue6NaCINt I'm proud of my work to ensure the safety and rights of all people in our great nation. https://t.co/ZZGz2rVGqK The Trump administration's disregard for civil rights and freedom is expressed in its transgender military ban. People should not be shut out from serving their country because of their identity. On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, it’s important to remember that justice is not passive. Justice is not blind. Justice requires action to rectify historic and ongoing discrimination. Yes, let us reflect on his dream today. But let us also fight for freedom every day. https://t.co/4Q9HPj5puV This is the reason oversight is so important. https://t.co/PJXly6saEU Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been 90 years old today. He led our nation forward, but the journey hasn't ended. Now, more than ever, we need to join together in the fight for justice and equity. "It isn’t by size that you win or fail—Be the best of whatever you are." RT @BillPascrell: The House just voted to fund the Dept of Agriculture so that @US_FDA can resume food inspections. Will Trump and the Sena… It's a terrible idea, like most of the drivel that comes from Trump. Americans are not building his medieval wall. Let's talk about real border security—technology to detect drugs coming through ports of entry and to identify illegal border crossings—not a stupid wall. Taking money away from Americans in Puerto Rico and reallocating it to build an ineffective border wall would exemplify Trump's twisted ideology. https://t.co/yhRdqfsSoh This morning, I sat down with Anne Marie Sullivan and other representatives of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association to discuss the effects the Trump Shutdown is having on America's workers. The Senate needs to pass the House bills to reopen government. https://t.co/bZ33o0kwS2 The President may want to abandon first responders, but Congress won't. https://t.co/cl7TQ86oHO The real crisis is the 800,000 American workers whose paychecks @realdonaldtrump is holding hostage. Look, we can agree on smart, effective border security solutions like new tech to scan for drugs and detect unauthorized crossings, but we are not building his stupid wall. https://t.co/vmQJvqP3v4 RT @washingtonpost: Fact Check: Trump did not accurately describe migrant children illegally brought into the United States https://t.co/5p… Our nation is best served by evidence-based strategies, not medieval monuments. #TrumpSpeech Trump is a fear-monger who is unfit for the dignity of the White House. https://t.co/AxLHLE1Dhv @ChadPergram Democrats don't support the wall because it is a vanity project aimed at division. Democrats support evidence-based strategies, not medieval monuments. This is a horrifying statistic: Last year, more than two dozen Native Americans went missing in Montana, most of them women. Violence against women is an epidemic, and it's disproportionately affecting women of color. https://t.co/4zdjErtbdv I want to know . . . how has the #TrumpShutdown affected you and your family? If you live in NJ-10, tell me your #ShutdownStory. I'll be sharing some stories of the Trump Shutdown's effects on our constituents. Let's get our government back to work! 

https://t.co/zYmw2jOwiv Thanks to Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo and his Chief of Staff, Phil Alagia, for coming to the Capitol today.

I hope you are safe, happy, and warm. https://t.co/ZvoeukmWIR With all the talk about the #TrumpShutdown, there’s a great deal of confusion about what that actually means. Here’s a quick explainer on what the government shutdown means for Americans: https://t.co/kkEczwauFj The #TrumpShutdown is dangerous for public safety and hurts Americans during the holidays. https://t.co/IRvBlBjWpy There are more than 4,900 federal workers in New Jersey who will be furloughed or work without pay over Christmas because Donald Trump is throwing a tantrum for his vanity wall. Those are families who will suffer because of the #TrumpShutdown. Republicans need to learn to govern. Despite the negativity swirling in Washington yesterday, I went to the House Floor to remind my colleagues that there are good people doing great things in our nation. I asked them to join me in honoring @LindenSchoolsNJ for Caroling for a Cause. https://t.co/1OKSXSqjkC @realDonaldTrump If you want the stupid wall so bad, put on your overalls and find a trowel. @realDonaldTrump Last time I checked, Republicans control the House and Senate. Amid the negative news, let’s highlight that the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act recently passed. It will strengthen  public health infrastructure for Alzheimer’s and related dementias. I was proud to support the bill. There's a Republican in the White House. Republicans are a majority in the Senate. Republicans have a majority in the House. If the government shuts down, putting hundreds of thousands of people's paychecks at risk over Christmas, it is because Republicans refuse to govern. That's what we all say. https://t.co/3fDCLNbGW1 @realDonaldTrump Take the day off. For those wondering whether Democrats would trade the Trump wall for the Gateway Project . . . no. Nobody wants Trump's stupid wall. We aren't trading the nation's most critical infrastructure project for a wasteful, ineffective,  environmentally unfriendly, egotistic wall. @LisaDNews Nobody wants Trump's stupid wall. We aren't trading the nation's most critical infrastructure project for a wasteful, ineffective, environmentally unfriendly, egotistic wall.

As communities come together for vigils tonight, I send my deepest condolences to families, friends, and loved ones who are affected. The tragedy of gun violence we have seen in houses of worship these past years is gut wrenching. Thanks to Dr. Pamela Clarke, President and CEO of the Newark Community Health Center, and Victor Cirilo, Executive Director of the Newark Housing Authority, for welcoming me today. We had a productive discussion about funding and development plans for NCHC reconstruction. https://t.co/Gkj4mpBm1J Thank you to all the law enforcement officers who have been pursuing every available lead for the past couple of days. And thank you for your continued investigation into these attempted bombings. You put your own safety at risk for the public, and we are grateful. https://t.co/PutahE2QHh I had a great time at Roselle High School with some great students today. They grilled me about my work in Congress, and I discussed the importance of voting. After all, if your vote didn’t count, why would people work so hard to convince you to stay home? https://t.co/LmZc0c5QEW The resiliency and professionalism of our @USPS workers and first responders shows the best of who we are as Americans. I am so thankful that, at this time, no one has been injured by these bombs. @realDonaldTrump Over the past 36 hours, the United States has faced a large scale, widespread assassination attempt. Thousands of postal workers and first responders are at risk of bodily harm. You’re complaining about Twitter when you should be joining in praise for first responders. In true form, @realDonaldTrump blames victims/targets of attempted terrorist attacks, rather than take responsibility for his role in advocating for violence and dehumanization. Thankfully no one has yet been injured, and praise to police/first responders/NYPD/postal workers. https://t.co/MHepnsgnrc RT @OfficialCBC: The @OfficialCBC condemns all threats and attempted acts of violence against our colleague @RepMaxineWaters and other prom… The right to vote is at the core of who we are as a nation. Too many people have suffered too long under policies that seek to undermine that sacred right. Today's ruling is an important one. Vote. Vote. Vote. https://t.co/wgdYUjsukl October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month. One in four American adults has a disability, and New Jerseyans with #disabilities have unique skills and talents that are much needed in the employment arena. I'm committed to helping them realize their potential. #NDEAM Earlier today, my office hosted a grants workshop for fire departments and emergency medical services. Thanks to Regional Fire Program Specialist Brian S. Thomas for serving as our special guest. And thanks to all the first responders who attended. https://t.co/OZurRJlO63 To the #trans community, I see you. I hear you. I will fight to keep this administration from pushing you into the shadows. .@senatemajldr forced through massive tax cuts for his rich friends. Now he wants to raid Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid to pay for his billionaire buddies’ tax cuts. The #GOPTaxScam doesn’t work #ForThePeople. Americans deserve better. https://t.co/hQ79kQzQ1o My heart goes out to the residents of Florida’s panhandle. Together, we will rebuild and recover. Thank you to first responders and utility crews who are on the ground getting things up and running. https://t.co/u28UW9HGSP This morning, I proudly joined @icare4autism to discuss the work we need to do to ensure that people with special abilities are free to fully engage in the workforce, in civil society, and in public service. https://t.co/vrzdnn6pfK Last week, @realDonaldTrump signed into law my proposal to strengthen security in public areas of transportation facilities, which was incorporated into the FAA Reauthorization Act. My statement (and links to the bills) can be found at https://t.co/nVfKknc7Jb Be a creator! The @CongressionalAC is a fun, innovative way to show off your coding chops. The deadline for registration and submission is October 15. #Congress4cs https://t.co/vbhcvSVhfF If you live in Florida's panhandle, heed the warnings of your local officials. Be safe. You can never be too prepared or too cautious. https://t.co/eP84p8Byk3
