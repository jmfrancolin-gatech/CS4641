This is what I told the CNN reporter; CNN reinterpreting my comments for the sake of headlines is the very definition of fake news. As it stands, Jeff Sessions is doing his job when the only leaks are coming from those being investigated. While I share the President’s concerns about the Russia investigation and believe it should end, Jeff Sessions is recused from that. A recent CNN news story mischaracterized my trust in Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He has my full trust and I think he's done an excellent job in de-politicizing the DOJ. The DOJ has many ongoing investigations and Jeff Sessions will ultimately be judged by their outcomes. I was honored to tour UAB Callahan Eye Hospital to see the cutting-edge research and to meet and hear from doctors and staff.

https://t.co/PVxqT7WNlg I was honored to receive the #FreedomFighter Award this week from @FreedomWorks. https://t.co/PPUUov5uso We must continue supporting our intelligence agencies as they protect us from those who would undermine our nation. Further, the 2016 election was not ultimately undermined. President Trump should take satisfaction that the American people elected him despite Russia's efforts. Our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia was successful only in hacking the DNC server. I'm glad President Trump has admitted he misspoke at the press conference &amp; I encourage him to evaluate the current situation as Russia continues to try to divide us. Putin is clearly a ruthless leader determined to make Russia a feared nation. I'm sure his operatives tried to influence the 2016 election, as confirmed by the CIA &amp; congressional investigations. But this shouldn't be confused with collusion between Russia &amp; Trump's campaign. I'm pleased that @Shipt has just announced an expansion that will create more than 800 new jobs in Birmingham over the next several years. This is another example of how Alabama is on the cutting edge of today's economy and the economy of the future #AL06

Ann and I want to express our deepest sympathy to Alabama AG Steve Marshall and his family upon the death of his wife, Bridgette. I know Steve is a man of faith, and our prayer is that God’s comfort will sustain him and his family in this time of unimaginable sorrow. My dad passed 6 years ago &amp; I often remember his investment in me, especially on Father's Day. I also think of children in fatherless homes &amp; the sad effects of fatherlessness.

https://t.co/pRx8jzZFvJ The First Amendment encourages open debate, not the stifling of ideas in the public square. View my questions from a recent committee hearing on this topic here: 
https://t.co/nVSA5L6NNo Abortions should not be considered "family planning" and no federal funds should be used to pay for them. I applaud the Trump Administration's proposal to try to protect our unborn children by ensuring that Title X funds are not used to end their lives. #TitleX I am deeply saddened by the devastating school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. Ann and I offer our prayers and condolences to everyone affected. So good to have my wife Ann with me at the White House today to watch the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem via satellite. The US is now the first nation to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. #USEmbassyJerusalem https://t.co/egPhdVym5U Today I had the opportunity to discuss SNAP (food stamps) and welfare reform. Work is the best means to escape an impoverished situation. See my questions here:

The factory produces heavy-duty cab-over-engine trucks and employs over 740 workers. https://t.co/MT2EPonIXC Congratulations to @RepJBridenstine on his confirmation as @NASA Administrator today →  https://t.co/8s9hVxR7ON My condolences and prayers go out to the Bush family after the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush. She loved her family well and left a great legacy for our country. She will be missed.
https://t.co/hCy0DuQ3Hd Today is the last #TaxDay that you will have to deal with a burdensome, obsolete tax code! Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, the tax code has been simplified, the economy is growing, and hardworking families are able to keep more of their paychecks. #TaxDay2018 https://t.co/Se7mrlk2pT I hope we not only remember how Dr. King died, but how he lived. He understood there are some causes so valuable that they are worth giving up our comfort, security, and perhaps even our lives. #MLK50 I recalled a testimony I once heard from Dr. Andrew Young, a witness to Dr. King’s murder. He said he realized later that Dr. King had done more for their cause in his death than he had in life. Dr. Young reflected, “There is no redemption without the shedding of blood.” Congress held a special ceremony today to honor MLK Jr.’s life, marking the 50th anniversary of his death. He believed in justice and in advancing the cause through love instead of hate. Speaker Ryan has given great service to our nation &amp; now with his decision to retire, he is demonstrating the character and sense of personal priorities that we all should emulate…that our 1st obligation is to our family, spouses &amp; children. I wish him &amp; his family the very best I will miss @SpeakerRyan, especially our policy discussions, but I fully understand his reasons for retiring and have the utmost respect for his decision. Congratulations @SenShelby on this prestigious Chairmanship! https://t.co/nARhzf65zd Watch LIVE as @AlabamaFTBL is honored at the @WhiteHouse: https://t.co/bO05tVhdyQ RT @AlabamaFTBL: #RollTide https://t.co/fBpfn4iHRQ Excited to welcome @AlabamaFTBL to DC &amp; the @WhiteHouse to honor their National Championship win! Great to visit the West Fraser lumber mill in Maplesville, which employs 135 workers and produces over 130 million board feet of southern yellow pine per year. Special thanks to West Fraser VP Sean McLaren and plant manager Paul Davis. https://t.co/nyLE0SZDZ9 Joining @pamabc3340 on @abc3340 right now! #AL06, make sure you tune in. https://t.co/NryHWh2Wjc RT @JimByardJr: Looking forward to tonight’s Town Hall Meeting with  @USRepGaryPalmer.

While I strongly support the increased funding for our military, I could not in good conscience vote for the Omnibus that costs almost $1.3 trillion. The military threats to our national security are real and serious, but so is the fiscal threat to our national security. Millions of Americans across the country are now reaping the benefits of tax reform in the form of higher paychecks, and my district is no exception. #AL06  https://t.co/xLSDaW5ATP This opening is great news for Bibb County.

Here is our updated timing gra… As a member of the House Oversight &amp; Government Reform Committee, I am working with my colleagues to bring more attention and create solutions to this national tragedy. The next breakfast will be June 12 at 8am at Canterbury United Methodist Church in Mtn. Brook. The speakers at this event, Mike and Deborah Bailey, showed great courage in sharing the story of their late daughter Ashlynn’s struggle with addiction. I was honored to attend the Freedom from Addiction Coalition Community Breakfast, hosted by the mayors of Vestavia Hills, Hoover, &amp; Mtn. Brook. This event raises awareness of drug addiction problems, prevention, &amp; recovery. https://t.co/e5p8m4P0BL I enjoyed participating in Center Point's 16th Annual Mayor's Prayer Breakfast last week. https://t.co/3cAv5A1GHd Enjoyed visiting with leaders from West Jefferson and Graysville to hear about issues affecting their communities. Special thanks to Mayors Charles Nix of West Jefferson, Julio Davis of Graysville, and Tammi Taylor for their time and insight. https://t.co/1XzgNjNxOI I hope President Trump will consider that there are other ways to address the rogue trade practices of countries like China. While I understand President Trump’s desire to protect U.S. businesses, I believe the new proposed broad-based tariffs could roll back much of the progress manufacturing has made and increase product costs. Tariffs, like taxes, are ultimately borne by American consumers. Significant tax and regulatory reforms by the President and Congress, combined with tremendous reductions in U.S. energy costs, have made America’s economy competitive again and have put U.S. manufacturing in the best position globally in years. Enjoyed speaking to the students at Banks Academy in Birmingham. The Christian school opened in 2015 and serves inner city high school students in the East Lake area. Special thanks to principal Dr. Kathy King and Darryl White. https://t.co/BdTqTfJfD8 Great to meet with a 5th grade class from Briarwood today at our nation’s Capitol.
