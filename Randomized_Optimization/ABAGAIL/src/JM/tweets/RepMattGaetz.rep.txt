I hope today‚Äôs negotiation will take the form of the framework @LindseyGrahamSC laid out‚Äîwhere we could get $5B for a physical barrier, enhance other elements of border security &amp; perhaps weave in elements of a TPS solution for ppl who are here from oftentimes war-torn countries. https://t.co/45QwwPYbdu RT @AmericaNewsroom: WATCH: @SandraSmithFox spoke with @RepMattGaetz before President Trump is set to host congressional leaders for a bord‚Ä¶ COMING UP: Catch me on @AmericaNewsroom w/ @BillHemmer &amp; @SandraSmithFox @ 9:30am ET/ 8:30am CT. I will be discussing the government shutdown. Don't miss it! We're not tired of winning here in Florida's First District! Bring on 2019! #opengaetz #NewYearsEve2018 https://t.co/RoLegLIp6M 115th HIGHLIGHTS: Open Gaetz Days are neighborhood days filled with events where constituents have personal access to my staff &amp; me. It's been invigorating to be around people who have a passion for strong citizenship &amp; a good community. Here's to many more in 116! #OpenGaetz https://t.co/2meh3xq3t5 In my district, farmers &amp; manufacturers are concerned about NAFTA &amp; how that impacts trade...the wall, precisely, won't impair trade. We need @POTUS' far better negotiated trade arrangement so Mexico can't cheat &amp; dump cheap agricultural products that hurt our country's farmers. TPS folks are some of the most hardworking ppl in this country. We could benefit economically by solving the TPS problem. The Bridge Act provides no amnesty &amp; no path to citizenship. It is simply a work extension so ppl can continue to contribute to the great American experience. It's not all about the inputs, it‚Äôs about the outcomes. The outcomes we seek is a secure border to protect the wages &amp; lives of the American people. @POTUS is sitting in DC meeting w/ senators &amp; working to come up w/ solutions, yet Pelosi is off in Hawaii‚Ä¶that's not helpful. https://t.co/ZdO0MzgjeM SHUTDOWN UPDATE: Coast Guard members will get paid on December 31st ‚Äì this applies to military members that served on active duty in December &amp; reserve military members that drilled prior to the shutdown. https://t.co/fwjDZ0upyw 115th HIGHLIGHTS: I helped 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ constituents who needed federal assistance, from resolving issues with the VA to obtaining a service animal. Such a rewarding part of my job is helping those get what they need to ensure a better quality of life. It is a privilege to serve you. https://t.co/4m4pOmnWMo If you did what the left wanted, we‚Äôd get rid of borders, abolish ICE, have every community as a sanctuary city, &amp; provide endless medical care better than what the veterans are getting in my district. I think what motivates @POTUS is the safety &amp; security of the American people. Look at the challenges our law enforcement officials have to face...they already have to fight against American murderers. They should not also have to fight against murderers from around the world that are dumped here because of our porous border. @FoxNews https://t.co/vKDPdB6x19 RT @jasoninthehouse: Coming up at the top of the hour on @FoxNews https://t.co/EqPbgcjpfi TONIGHT: I will be on @foxnews with @jasoninthehouse @ 9:10pm ET/ 8:10pm CT talking about the Democrats calling for hearings over migrant's death while they stay silent over inner city deaths in Chicago and Baltimore....

Wishing you a safe holiday season with the ones you love. Have a Merry Christmas and prosperous New Year! https://t.co/b8R2ZBvGID 95% of border security say they agree physical barriers assist in the performance of their duties. We can have a strategy to secure the border but Dems keep voting against all things we hope will keep the country safe like: e-verify, sanctuary city reform, ending chain migration. https://t.co/c83f8F300V MUST-READ: ‚ÄúRep. Gaetz on Trump's Border Funding Meeting: 'He Is in This for the Long Haul'‚Äù via @FoxNewsInsider #BuildTheWall https://t.co/np925nj4Bj There will be a substantial commitment to border security or this will be an extended shutdown. If people don't believe in physical barriers, I guess leave your front door open when you go to bed at night...they typically work. That is why the president is fighting for it. .@POTUS is fighting for middle class Americans who want to live on safe streets &amp; have their wages protected by an immigration system &amp; families who are concerned that if we don't have a physical barrier, the risk of drugs &amp; criminals could really be challenging for our country. https://t.co/Cwd9cbgLZ6 We don't want business as usual. https://t.co/XzME4F1pcN We must have a physical barrier. Dems continue to constrain ways the admin could execute the physical barrier w/ the use of fencing, walls, drones, &amp; other forms of technology that are working to cease cartel members &amp; those who bring special interest in aliens into the country. https://t.co/QIId2WNzAs RT @RichardLui: Join our 3pE @MSNBC broadcast w/:

@No‚Ä¶ UP NEXT: I will be providing another government shutdown update on @CNN w/ @AnaCabrera @ 5pm ET/ 4pm CT. Don‚Äôt miss it! The reason big business wants a deal is because they want the cheap labor...but who ends up paying for that? The American worker &amp; the American family, who wants the safety that comes with a secure border. Both sides of the aisle wanted @POTUS to take a bad deal that didn't have any funding for border security. He did his job &amp; pushed back. He made it clear that he is not going to take a bad deal from the Democrats. We'll have real border security or we'll have a long shutdown. https://t.co/yrCXl1C06J UP NEXT: Catch me on @ANHQDC w/ @LelandVittert @ 1:05pm ET/ 12:05pm CT.

Negotiations will likely continue quite late.

I will keep you posted as things develop, and for breaking updates! I am working diligently with colleagues to reopen the government! In the meantime, you can find some helpful resources in the link below as we face this partial shutdown: 
https://t.co/Dq05yY3fSd Unlike shutdowns in previous years, national parks are expected to remain OPEN ‚Äî though they will not be staffed by personnel, and the facilities (like restrooms and visitor centers) will be closed. UPDATE: The House adjourned until Saturday @ noon w/out agreement to fund the departments &amp; agencies whose funding expires @ midnight tonight ‚Äî 3/4 of the government has already been funded. The DoD has already been funded, so military personnel &amp; operations will be unaffected. This is not about the wall for Democrats. It's not even about immigration for Democrats. This is about denying @POTUS a win on a signature agenda item that he promised the American people. @FoxNews @seanhannity https://t.co/GYetG4DnTV .@POTUS is not someone who wants to maintain a foreign presence that is outsized for the United States of America. I think he wants to see more of America's moms &amp; dads at home, &amp; less of our treasure being spilled decade after decade in the Middle East w/ little to show for it. I think the utilization of contractors to engage in more of a train &amp; equip mission for local forces working with our allies to set up safe zones for people that are really trapped in a humanitarian crisis ‚Äî those are things we can work on w/ allies &amp; the international community. https://t.co/tbDu7TjZvY The animal and mentorship programs included in the First Step Act will improve inmates‚Äô quality of life, as well as the lives of our four-legged friends. This bill is a step forward for criminal justice reform, and it will help animal shelters and abandoned animals nationwide.
