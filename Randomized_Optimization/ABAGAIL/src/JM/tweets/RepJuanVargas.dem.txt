Thank you to the volunteers who support this important effort to help our homeless veterans. https://t.co/1kTqHQ1Gpq Last week, the FIND Trafficking Act passed unanimously in the House and @SenCortezMasto introduced the Senate companion bill. This bill will help Congress understand how virtual currencies are used to facilitate crimes‚Äîhoping to see bipartisan support for this bill in the Senate. When I visited immigration detention centers, the children I spoke to all wanted one thing: to see their moms. I joined my colleagues in introducing the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act to reunite families torn apart by the President's cruel policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pVaQjZ6eWc SCOTUS delivered a devastating blow to working people in America. Unions are quintessentially American and critical in the fight for fair wages and worker protections. Today‚Äôs decision is disappointing and its consequences will be damaging for workers across the country. #Janus Salmon recovery is economically and culturally important to the country. The House adopted my amendment to H.R. 2083 to ensure that salmon recovery efforts are rooted in science by studying the effects of lethal takings of sea lions on the recovery of salmon stocks. Today, the Supreme Court upheld discrimination. President Trump's Muslim Ban is un-American, it does not make our country safer, and it will forever be a shameful stain on our nation's history. #NoMuslimBanEver RT @LaPrensaSD: #ICYMI Congressional delegation visits San Diego to advocate for immigrant families https://t.co/Hyo26Lf1hH https://t.co/cy‚Ä¶ Voting is a right, not a privilege.
