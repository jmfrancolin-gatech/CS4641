In the #FarmBill, Congress chose NOT to make any harmful changes to nutrition assistance because these provisions make hunger worse and do nothing to help Americans get ahead. The rule restricts states‚Äô long-standing ability to respond to unemployment and economic hardship in their own communities, jeopardizing food assistance for families while they are struggling to find steady work. The same day the bipartisan #FarmBill became law, the Trump Administration announced a proposed #SNAP waiver rule that ignores the intent of Congress and takes food away from families. Today through April 2, the rule is open for public comment. NEWS: Ranking Member @SenStabenow raises concerns about the impact of the CFTC shutdown on farmers, businesses, and consumers.
