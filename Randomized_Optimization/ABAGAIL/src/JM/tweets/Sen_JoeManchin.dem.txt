In the months following Sago, we passed historic legislation to improve safety standards for our coal miners.

In #WV, especially in our rural communities, we understand the importance of our post offices. In many small towns, they are the lifelines of their communities and a way to stay connected. Given that the POST Plan was undertaken after significant backlash against the previous proposal to close thousands of post offices, it stands to reason that nearly the nearly 500 post offices affected by this plan would be vulnerable to closure if USPS were privatized.

Gayle and I send our best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashanah. From now on the VA hospital in Huntington will be known as the Hershel “Woody” Williams VA Medical Center. I was honored participate in today’s naming ceremony. There is nobody more deserving of this honor than my good friend @WoodyWilliams45. https://t.co/DiMPZQmMSD This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of whitewater rafting in the Mountain State! #WV is home to some of the best whitewater rafting in the world &amp; it brings more than 50k visitors to our state each year. What is your favorite rafting memory? #ThisIsWV  https://t.co/fULaa0fFaq Today I hosted my 5th roundtable discussion on pre-existing conditions in Huntington. Access to healthcare is the difference between life &amp; death for the 800k WVians w/ pre-existing conditions. I'll continue doing everything in my power to protect access to affordable healthcare. https://t.co/5hbWOmTsMH Today I took to the Senate floor again to urge my colleagues to pass my resolution to protect nearly 800,000 West Virginians and millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions from losing their healthcare. https://t.co/u3Re8OBZLp I gave the people of #WV my word that I would give Judge Kavanaugh a fair and thorough examination. In that spirit I am attending a portion of today’s hearing to learn more about Judge Kavanaugh’s record and qualifications. This #LaborDay we honor the strong men &amp; women who have tirelessly sacrificed to make America the best country in the world. West Virginia workers have set the bar with their dedication &amp; work ethic. May God bless our workers &amp; may God bless the state of West Virginia. Gayle and I had the best time walking in the parade at the Italian Heritage Festival in Clarksburg today. We saw familiar faces and made new friends. Hope everyone is enjoying the holiday weekend! https://t.co/zgmRKboDps Good luck to @WVUfootball and @HerdFB as they kick off their season openers this afternoon! How are you celebrating game day? #WV The Oak Leaf Festival is this weekend in Oak Hill. With a parade, live music, a car show &amp; chili cook-off there is fun for the entire family #ThisIsWV. View the full schedule here: https://t.co/U2z1DSAJdd I'm excited to announce nearly $12 million in funding to allow three #WV service providers to build out broadband services over the next 10 years at 7,962 locations throughout West Virginia. MORE: https://t.co/E7IemMtWdq My heart goes out to Cindy and the McCain children as they mourn this unimaginable loss. Gayle and I join a grateful nation in praying for their comfort in the days to come. Even in the face of cancer, he stood tall and fought bravely. But that came as no surprise to those of us who have been privileged enough to know John. Senator John McCain lived his life with the upmost integrity and he held the rest of us to that same standard. His commitment to our nation is unparalleled and we are all better for the example he set. This afternoon Gayle and I were honored to participate in the unveiling of a new monument to honor Katherine Johnson at West Virginia State University. She is a trail blazer and well deserving of this honor! https://t.co/fF2tOcVHgI Today is the Lemonade Festival in Bluefield. The festival focuses on lemonade and combines the symbol of summer with music, food, children’s activities and more. And the parade starts at 10 AM! #ThisIsWV https://t.co/63PGMzfsht I urge Senator McConnell to allow the Senate to vote on this important amendment. Nearly 800,000 West Virginians and 1.8 million Kentuckians’ lives depend on it. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue, this is life or death to many. I refuse to sit idly by while West Virginia’s own Attorney General tries to allow insurance companies to play God by deciding who they will and will not insure. This cruel lawsuit would put nearly 800,000 West Virginians at risk of financial ruin if they’ve been identified to have a pre-existing condition. We had a bipartisan agreement to vote but yet again Mitch McConnell chose to play politics with the healthcare of millions of Americans, 1.8 million of them in his home state of Kentucky. What’s happening today in the Senate is disgusting. Once again, Mitch McConnell is letting politics determine the work of the Senate by refusing to allow the Senate to vote on my common sense amendment to protect healthcare access for those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/mXgVTschTb We have an opportunity today to stand up for the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions that are trusting us to protect their healthcare access. It’s just common sense and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution. The Senate is scheduled to vote on an amendment supporting my resolution to allow Senate Legal Counsel intervene in the lawsuit threatening 800k WVians access to health insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/sxOTkBdFHk Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. I introduced a plan to improve and provide broad-reaching care to treat West Virginians with black lung disease. MORE: https://t.co/r38t4Cr0Ea Recent reports suggest that the Medicare trust fund will be insolvent within the next 10 years. I sent a letter to @HHSGov Secretary Alex Azar asking him to explain why and clarify how this insolvency will impact #WV https://t.co/0nMK0fspRa Today my good friend Lilly Ledbetter stopped by my D.C. office to visit. My first vote in the Senate was for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and I continue to support equal pay for equal work in every way I can. https://t.co/eoFb4kjZJC RT @SVACDems: After continued concerns about @DeptVetAffairs inability to track its budget and spending of the Choice Program, @SenatorTest… ICYMI: I was in Shepherdstown yesterday to discuss the importance of protecting healthcare access from West Virginian's with pre-existing conditions. Read my op-ed in today's @TheJournalWV: https://t.co/vTACbsjO25 For a lot of West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, insurance coverage is the difference between life and death, and I will do everything I can to protect them. #WV https://t.co/7EgNGmpPnF For a lot of West Virginians with pre-existing conditions, insurance coverage is the difference between life and death, and I will do everything I can to protect them. Thanks to everyone who joined me today for this important discussion! "The Declaration of Independence says all men are created equal. It doesn't say unless you have a pre-existing condition." - Dr. Dawn Jones, Shenandoah Community Health Center "Senator - what you've described over the last hour is it doesn't have to be either or. It's not a sound economy with sick people or a healthy population but we're broke. We just need to use common sense to find solutions." - Pastor Joey Rainey, Covenant Church Shepherdstown "Everyone - whether they like it or not is going to be affected. The economic impact of a repeal will be felt in every aspect of our society. I've heard from over 8,000 West Virginians about the impact will have on their lives." - @Sen_JoeManchin "We all agree that the ACA needs to be tweaked. There is room for it to be improved and repaired." - @Sen_JoeManchin "It's common sense. If you're sick, you go to the doctor. You don't go to the E.R. for a headache. But people need access to the doctor first." - George Blough, cancer survivor "Unfunded care costs all of us. As a chaplain I get called to the E.R. often and many of the patients don't have money to pay those medical bills. Those costs get past on. The ACA isn't perfect, but it's the beginning." - Pastor Eddie Edmonds, Moler Ave. Church of the Brothren "I have about 6 pre-existing conditions and without insurance I'd be in a jam. The Affordable Care Act has changed my life." - JoAnn, client at Shenandoah Community Health Center "If those with substance abuse disorder are cut off from healthcare access, we will see the opioid epidemic in West Virginia get exponentially worse. People need ongoing access to healthcare because recovery is an ongoing process." - Dave Didden, Jefferson Co. Health Dept. "I've worked with low income populations for years. The ramifications of not having healthcare are wide. They can't work, they can't get housing because they are bankrupt from their medical bills. It affects every access of their life." Michelle Goldman, nurse at free clinic "I can't believe people are so set on repealing this access without a replacement plan in place. We can't go back to a time when one illness could mean financial ruin for a family in West Virginia." - @Sen_JoeManchin "But for the first time we have people getting treatment for mental illness or substance abuse when they never had it before. People who never had access to health insurance have it now. But we never taught anyone how to use this new access." - @Sen_JoeManchin "Do I think the Affordable Care Act is everything it should be? No. And I have said that. If I had been there in 2009, I would have fought for a better product mix." - @Sen_JoeManchin I'm in Shepherdstown this morning to meet with community members about our concerns about protecting healthcare coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. I'm joined by healthcare providers, cancer survivors and faith leaders for this important discussion. I spent the afternoon in Huntington at the Italian Festival. I am proud of my families Italian heritage and cherish the opportunity to celebrate it with my fellow West Virginians. https://t.co/FpOheGGLI0 The WV American Art Glass studio &amp; gallery in Weston provides live glassblowing demonstrations, open to the public every day.They also offer tours upon request. Visit to see a variety of art glass &amp; learn more about the process. @LewisCoCVB  #ThisIsWV https://t.co/mLJpqQDV3g I'm excited to announce $763K for cancer research in #WV. We must fund research at the local level &amp; I'll keep advocating for these resources. MORE: https://t.co/hxj7NIxxa9 #WV is the only state that is full within the @ARCgov jurisdiction.
