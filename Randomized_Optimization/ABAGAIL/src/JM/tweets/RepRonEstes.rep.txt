We will never forget those who lost their lives on that day, nor will we forget the heroic acts of brave men and women that showed the world American strength, resilience and fortitude. https://t.co/rku9KJE7ov Today, @wsutech hosted Assistant Secretary Scott Stump from the US Dept. of Education, local businesses, school districts and @ksregents to showcase the incredible collaboration that happens here in Wichita to fill the needs of our skilled workforce. #WheresRon https://t.co/8CRHdl13H8 Last month @WichitaPolice, FBI and a division of @ICEgov arrested 8 people in Wichita for human trafficking. Rather than disavow ICE &amp; all law enforcement, these men &amp; women deserve our support. Last week I spoke on the House floor to thank them for keeping our community safe. https://t.co/mVTWxYAvnM In honor of #GrandparentsDay today, I wanted to take a moment and thank the volunteers of the Foster Grandparent Program throughout Kansas. Their work is helping children become better readers, students and citizens. #seniorcorpsworks https://t.co/DXnjZ9ajZ5 Yesterday I spoke to the KS Farm Bureau Ag Leaders Breakfast at the State Fair about the importance of the Farm Bill, trade &amp; tariffs, &amp; my work on the Education &amp; Workforce Committee. More importantly, I was able to thank our ag community for their hard work. #WheresRon https://t.co/Qcu3C0BUme What a great day to celebrate our aviation heritage and support our military at the @22ARW Open House and Airshow. Despite the clouds, Susan and I enjoyed the aircrafts and performances. You have one more chance to visit Sunday. #WheresRon https://t.co/3Xf9CtDjLf Last week I toured @TextronAviation's facilities in southwest Wichita. It's one more reminder of our great aviation history in Kansas and the exceptional work of our manufacturers, engineers and researchers here in the #AirCapital. #WheresRon https://t.co/8yc2vYKHoS Good news: The latest jobs report shows our economy is booming with 201,000 new jobs created in August. Unemployment is at 3.9% and wages grew at the fastest rate in 9 years. #BetterOffNow  https://t.co/8BEDbzB6Zx This morning I greeted WWII, Korean War and Vietnam War-era veterans from Kansas in Washington as part of the Kansas Honor Flight which flies veterans to our nation's capital to experience their memorials. It’s  always an honor to thank them and hear their stories. #WheresRon https://t.co/Qn09vedzpg Proud to be named a 'Hero of Main Street' by the National Retail Federation for helping small businesses grow. I enjoyed receiving the award from a #KS04 native and manager at Pride Ag Resources ACE Hardware while discussing the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct and need for free &amp; fair trade. https://t.co/qDhqaJ4X29 Brian and Claudale Arterburn are public servants and local heroes. Claudale is back on the force following her husband's recovery from his critical injuries received during an investigation. Please join me in thanking them for their dedicated service. https://t.co/hFqDOdHaZR More KC-46 air refueling tankers coming to @22ARW means 400 new jobs right here in our District. The KC-46 is a valuable tool for our military, which is one of the reasons I was proud to support the recent NDAA that includes funding for more tankers. https://t.co/Sn1KxmNCd9 Like veterans and military members, military spouses are unsung heroes who deserve our support. This morning I was honored to join @the_USO filling care packages for military spouses around the world. #MilSpouseSalute #WheresRon https://t.co/DjNQxT5oyV With more rain on the way this week, many counties remain under a flash flood watch in #KS04 and throughout Kansas. Keep families already impacted in Pratt &amp; Manhattan in your prayers &amp; pay attention to local authorities on the potential for more flooding. https://t.co/bzHGFxJrW9 Today on #LaborDay, many Kansans across the state are enjoying the day with family and friends. I also want to recognize those who work through the holiday. I'm grateful for their commitment and I hope you'll thank those working today if you see them. https://t.co/8vu1XEG5ma 1 month. 12 counties. More than 40 visits, tours &amp; events. During the August district work period I discussed important issues like our growing economy, the need for free &amp; fair trade, the status of the Farm Bill, &amp; our work to support veterans. Read more: https://t.co/C3eVeyTDeL https://t.co/HQwS9xwr6E As State Treasurer, I oversaw KPERS and understand the importance of allowing every family to save for retirement. I'm glad to see President Trump take action to make it easier to save for the future, a shared priority for tax reform 2.0. https://t.co/qeyDze4j76 Read about my recent visit to Pawnee Co. I enjoy hearing from constituents across our district &amp; discussing how we're working to improve our economy &amp; quality of life. There's more to do but from tax cuts to VA reform, Kansans are #BetterOffNow. #WheresRon https://t.co/Oh1dTqITF2 It was a pleasure to tour Greensburg’s Big Well Museum, Kiowa Co. Memorial Hospital, and the state-of-the-art Kiowa Co. Media Center. Eleven years after the devastating 2007 tornado, Greensburg has displayed the resilience, strength &amp; compassion Kansans are known for. #WheresRon https://t.co/DdVMnFSh9A Yesterday I visited Carr Auto-Electric in Pawnee Co. to talk about trade, immigration, tax reform, &amp; how Kansans are #BetterOffNow. I also visited the Offerle Coop in Edwards Co. to discuss the affects of tariffs on agriculture and the need for free and fair trade. #WheresRon https://t.co/05kmF7ikQW In St. John I met w/ people at Tiger Town Pizza, a small business started by local high school students, to discuss federal issues &amp; what's happening locally like a new grocery store &amp; challenges with Quivira National Wildlife Refuge. Also visited Golden Belt Feeders. #WheresRon https://t.co/YEx1nAhfq2 I enjoyed opening two affordable housing communities for veterans and senior citizens in Wichita &amp; Valley Center. From health care to housing, veterans and seniors deserve our support. That's why I cosponsored the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act in Congress. #WheresRon https://t.co/VJ5RkgYk5M I'm thankful to local law enforcement and @ICEgov for the work they do to stop human trafficking at our borders, around the country, and even in our own community. https://t.co/3d4Pl308HS Consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high today. That's great news but you wouldn't know it reading the @nytimes online homepage, business, politics or US sections. Luckily, Americans know our economy is growing and #BetterOffNow. As representative of the Air Capital of the World, I'm proud to fight for our aviation industry in Congress. Read about some of the ways we are protecting general aviation and improving the TSA for the future: https://t.co/Nlp2jfm9wz The US-Mexico Trade Agreement unveiled by President Trump today is great news for Kansas farmers and manufacturers. As a consistent advocate for free and fair trade, I applaud President Trump for bringing Mexico to the negotiating table.

If you are a veteran and need assistance, you can reach out to our District Office in Wichita at https://t.co/ugGfTisLtP. #WheresRon https://t.co/lwKlnf99vF Susan and I are praying for the family of @SenJohnMcCain – an American hero who served his country admirably in the Navy and in our nation's capital. He was dedicated to the people of Arizona, and

https://t.co/90uoaUPgWj Enjoyed discussing these important issues with the @ChamberWichita today. #WheresRon https://t.co/a42MAJlfqf Today is #NationalAviationDay! Kansas has a rich history in aviation – from manufacturing, maintenance to our own McConnell Air Force Base. We're proud of this heritage, and on Sept. 8 &amp; 9, you can experience it up close at the @22ARW Open House &amp; Airshow. https://t.co/VMXOkUeh17 (2/2) Since entering Congress, I've written and met w/ the administration more than a dozen times advocating for free &amp; fair trade. If you've been impacted by recent tariffs, I want to hear from you at https://t.co/ugGfTisLtP as I continue ensuring trade talks support Kansans. This study is more evidence why I'm a consistent advocate for free and fair trade. As President Trump uses tariffs in the short-term to bring countries like China to the table, we must ensure KS farmers &amp; manufacturers are protected in the long-term. (1/2) https://t.co/aerkeGPWpd I was honored to join today's @thef35 event at Globe Engineering in Wichita to discuss the F-35 &amp; its economic impact on KS.

We need transparency and competition in health care to help families and local pharmacies thrive. #WheresRon https://t.co/yjcX2zXWZN I enjoyed recent visits to Butler County to discuss our work to cut taxes, get government out of the way, and advocate for free and fair trade. There’s more to do, but I’m glad to see these efforts helping our community be #BetterOffNow. #WheresRon https://t.co/KIWiwMLt7U I was honored to be a part of yesterday's third annual Veterans Awareness Expo in Wichita.

It's truly incredible what is happening in our amazing District. #WheresRon https://t.co/A47az13BRY This week is also the Butler County Fair. The Butler County Farm Bureau has a display for participants to test their agriculture knowledge. #WheresRon https://t.co/kBzfivFOUy BG Products is headquartered in Wichita with facilities in El Dorado and Derby. Last week they represented Kansas in the White House's Made in America event. #WheresRon https://t.co/Hvaj99XAvA Today I was in Butler County visiting with constituents and local businesses.

It was a pleasure hosting Dr. Bardo and hearing about all of the innovative ways @WichitaState is preparing students for the future. https://t.co/AaBvG1Hm3F Yesterday I also supported a historic overhaul of the Carl D. Perkins CTE Act. As our booming economy now has more job openings than qualified applicants, this bill will better prepare students with skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. https://t.co/Zk9l4geYKg .@WichitaState is a leader in closing the skills gap and adapting to changing education &amp; job needs. As a member of the @EdWorkforce Committee, yesterday I was proud to invite WSU President Dr. John Bardo to DC to discuss these measures, which serve as a model for the US. https://t.co/PYcwzXXvDR Obamacare is broken. From 2010–2016, premiums increased $4,372 per family. Instead of more government, we need competition &amp; free market solutions like HSAs. This week the House is considering bills to do just that. Read my op-ed on why they are needed: https://t.co/zX4aNG9qo9 More good news!   "The organization’s board of directors has approved paying a mid-year bonus of up to $1,000 per employee after the federal government’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December, lowered tax rates for businesses and individuals." https://t.co/Mz51fvNESM I enjoyed discussing how a strong Farm Bill and free and fair trade support Kansas agriculture with the @kansasag and @KSAgRetailers today. #WheresRon https://t.co/OZ0oPvfe4G
