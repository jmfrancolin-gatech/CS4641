In response to the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, which I co-sponsored, the DoD began issuing letters in July Congrats to FRC-East for 75 years of commendable service &amp; unparalleled work. Your efforts are an integral part of military readiness &amp; the protection of this great nation.  I wish FRC-East &amp; its employees continued success for its next 75 years of support to our service members.

Follow instructions of local &amp; state officials so you know when an area is safe Today, we also honor the families who lost their loved ones, or never knew if they would make it home. It is a pain that no one should have to bear, but know that we as Americans are here for you. Today on #POWMIARecognitionDay, we remember the many brave Americans who have been held as prisoners of war &amp; those who never made it home. To you, we owe our gratitude, honor &amp; respect.
