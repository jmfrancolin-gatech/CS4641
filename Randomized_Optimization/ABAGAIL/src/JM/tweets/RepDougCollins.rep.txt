RT @JudiciaryGOP: The preemptive and unnecessary move to subpoena has delivered smoke without substance. This hearing is nothing more than… Today's hearing was scheduled to conduct oversight of @TheJusticeDept. Since the Democrats' document dump and letter flurry make it clear they've planned to conduct no actual oversight, the best use of the committee's time is to adjourn. Looks like @RepJerryNadler forgot to include his most recent letter to acting AG Whitaker confirming there would be no subpoena tomorrow.

This is absolutely appalling. We must stop the evil practice of infanticide and stand up for the value of human life. https://t.co/mcTMPXB0Sx As I have said before, a subpoena is a powerful and coercive tool.

It’s been an honor to serve with him in our delegation and on @RulesReps. I will miss him, and Georgia will miss his voice.

While @realDonaldTrump delivered a message of unity and inspiration, @staceyabrams jumped at the opportunity to advocate for resistance and retribution. #SOTU Tonight, @realDonaldTrump delivered a message that should resonate with every American: We can build a confident and more prosperous future by embracing unity over division.

And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God. #SOTU We’re working to expand access to affordable, quality health care for all Americans. @RealDonaldTrump has energized efforts to make prescription drugs more affordable by ensuring #PBM middlemen actually pass on savings to patients at the counter. #SOTU You can’t sustain generosity without integrity. @RealDonaldTrump is right to protect safe, legal paths into the United States by fighting illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug smuggling. #SOTU https://t.co/pZp1BHpm51 .@RealDonaldTrump worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass the #FirstStepAct, restoring hope to families across the nation.

It’s past time for them to take their seats at the negotiating table &amp; legislate like they were sent here to do. Today @POTUS outlined a plan that puts people first. His plan provides for comprehensive border security that will help keep Americans &amp; migrants safe. @realDonaldTrump’s commitment to America’s workers remains unshakable, &amp; he continues to offer solutions to end this shutdown. It’s past time we fix the Flores settlement, restore integrity in our asylum system, and protect the safety of unaccompanied minors. I urge Congress to quickly pass — and @realdonaldtrump to sign — our bill, Fix the Immigration Loopholes Act.

If Democrats want to come to the table that is set to address America’s mental health crisis &amp; the human factors contributing to mass violence, they’ll find that their colleagues across the aisle have been here working on real solutions for some time. They’re welcome to join us. To be clear, the task before us is to identify solutions that actually save lives. This legislation shows us that they are less interested in adopting solutions to prevent mass violence than in promoting gun control. Recent shootings reflect failures not of existing policy—background checks are already in place and working across the board—but failures in its implementation. While I share my colleagues’ conviction that Congress must find effective ways to prevent violence, promote public safety, and protect life, today’s bill is not a solution on any of these fronts. Yesterday, House Democrats introduced legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales and most gun transfers.

Earnings are rising the fastest for farmers. #gapol https://t.co/lQVqA78LUh https://t.co/9eJDZspThV RT @SpeakerRyan: A big thank you to everyone who helped put music creators back in charge of their own work: @RepGoodlatte, @RepDougCollins… Today, the House passed a holistic bill to fight the #OpioidCrisis by equipping families, victims and law enforcement with crucial resources. I hope that, with the president’s signature, it brings help to people in #GA09 and beyond very soon. https://t.co/u6LWYeCGfl Thanks to @ourPPA CEO David Trust for testifying @HouseJudiciary today about the importance of @RepJeffries’ #CASEAct, which would help small creators defend their rights and protect their livelihoods. The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct is fueling our economy's growth, creating jobs, and bringing relief to individuals in #GA09, and there's more we can do as #TaxReform 2.0 moves forward this week. https://t.co/0q6JDj8aVZ Georgia is a great state for doing business, and today I welcome the @GAChamber to Washington as they share their work to make our state even more competitive. https://t.co/06SD9AWA5P Families in #GA09 and across the nation have suffered deeply under the #opioidcrisis, I look forward to swift action that will land this package on President Trump’s desk and bring them relief through the Substance Abuse Prevention Act &amp; other initiatives. https://t.co/T1oLBrMUC8 The #MusicModernizationAct is heading to President Donald Trump's desk to be signed into law after the House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to approve the same version of the historic copyright legislation that passed the Senate last week. https://t.co/l6WPZ8mVdI For everyone who’s ever loved a song, it’s been my honor to work alongside songwriters, publishers, digital streamers, broadcasters, artists and fellow lawmakers to make the music licensing landscape fairer and freer through the #MusicModernizatioAct. https://t.co/lnIh9PX5O0 Glad to see prohibitions on pharmacy gag clauses pass the House &amp; help deliver Medicare prescriptions at lower costs &amp; w/ more clarity. There’s more to do to make medicines more affordable by increasing competition in the prescription drug market, including #PhairPricing Act. Today, @senorrinhatch, @SenatorLeahy, @RepJerryNadler &amp; I introduced the ART Act to allow visual artists to receive fairer payment for their work. Creativity is an American value, so treating creative expressions fairly an American virtue. #CreativeRights https://t.co/iI63m5jakZ It's an honor to work with and on behalf of creators. https://t.co/VOcH1zUuJV The Justice Department should be free from political bias in all of it’s functions. What can @HouseJudiciary do to identify and correct improper bias? @FoxNews https://t.co/IGrGGHyTJx Thanks to #taxcuts and deregulation, our surging economy is putting more Georgians to work than ever. In August, GA hit a record high of 4.96M employed residents, up by nearly 115K over the year &amp; we saw the fewest unemployment claims in 20+ years. 
https://t.co/lpyVMHdbAp With a 415-0 passage in the House earlier this year, I’m hopeful that our chamber will send the #MusicModernizationAct successfully out of Congress before the next recess. https://t.co/Kd38RYG4c7 Grateful for the work of my fellow Airmen. Here’s to 71 years of air superiority. Aim high! #flyfightwin https://t.co/vB0d3qXgT3 It’s a pleasure to recognize Jan Hackett of the Fannin Co. Chamber of Commerce for earning the 2018 Tourism Leadership Award for her work on behalf of #GA09 tourism and the local economy. @BlueRidgeGA https://t.co/dbz5jRJT0d Showing Caroline of @JaemorFarms the floor speech I had the opportunity to deliver in honor of her excellence in agricultural endeavors in #GA09. @GeorgiaGrown https://t.co/KtXReqbaQ1 As #HurricaneFlorence arrives, listening to local authorities will help keep you safe, &amp; checking out this story of how @WaffleHouse team members from Georgia are feeding people in North Carolina may help keep you smiling. https://t.co/wqxcexiRql Interested in why the funding bills the House passed today are significant or what recent milestones we’ve reached in #GA09 communities? Check out my latest newsletter here: https://t.co/6UghoImjnu Georgia is tracking #HurricaneFlorence and has declared a state of emergency for all 159 Georgia counties, including the 20 in #GA09. Stay safe by listening to local officials and weather reports. https://t.co/FF0A7wQEiO The state of our economy? Higher wages being paid as there are more jobs to be filled.

@WSJ reports that the Atlanta Fed’s “wage tracker” showed a 3.2% increase year-over-year for June. Interested in other recent measures of wage and growth? https://t.co/hyfKcNALc8 #Sept11 took away the futures of children, parents, first responders, veterans, and others who were dearly loved and now are daily missed. We remember the lives that were sacrificed for others and that were stolen outright that day. We #NeverForget. Local business and hardworking people are still benefitting from #TaxReform that has lowered their taxes, helped increase their real wages, and sparked bonuses in #GA09. https://t.co/vYyh4nIEuS More than 650,000 people are released from federal and state prison every year, and more than 75% of them will be behind bars again within five years. We can help restore individuals and protect communities today by moving the #FIRSTSTEP Act forward. https://t.co/Sj4gBFyqDI Mourning the loss of #BurtReynolds. Filmed in #GA09, Smokey and the Bandit left an indelible mark on my Northeast Georgia home. Thanks for the memories, Burt. #gapol https://t.co/MVHv5PyW6x Let's be fair--Democrats vowed to oppose the president's nominee before they knew who he or she would be simply because it is this @POTUS's nomination. #KavanaughConfirmation @FoxBusiness https://t.co/BjuEH4YFJK Looking forward to joining @EveningEdit with @LizMacDonaldFOX at 5:00 to review today's biggest news items. Couldn't be happier to hear "reports that these improvements are already helping 'the residents of the Tate City Communities of Georgia and North Carolina, as well as others who love to camp, hike, fish and/or simply enjoy the Upper Tallulah River Valley'” https://t.co/2uw3fdf3A0 Clermont is now officially home to the LCPL Zack T. Addington Postal Facility. Many would say we gathered to honor Zack because he was killed in action, but we also celebrate the Marine because he lived, and he lived well. #GA09 #gapol https://t.co/bgktoMG4tE https://t.co/gU8VigoyTW Northeast Georgia’s natural beauty is unparalleled. Check out this update on how I'm working with #GA09 residents to defend our natural resources and maintain the infrastructure that allows Georgians to enjoy them: https://t.co/YaA3thsV8K https://t.co/kdGBJXnsMP When the good news gets even better: "Business investment and inventories contributed more to growth than previously thought. The April-June period was the first full quarter with the tax cuts signed by @POTUS in effect." #TaxReform  https://t.co/rS0gSOqF44 Georgia's investment in the creative industry continues to bring jobs and revenue to our state: https://t.co/J2Np40n3J0 It was an honor to stand with the Jewish community of Forsyth, Dawson, and Lumpkin Counties and receive the Friend of Israel Award this week. https://t.co/iSw3lZSe9w Joining my fellow Americans in reflecting on @SenJohnMcCain’s decades of resolute service to these United States. I hope peace and comfort surround his loved ones as his singular legacy lives on. I supported the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, and we continue to see #GA09 residents keeping more of their money and job creators increasing employee benefits as a result. 

RT if you agree Americans are #BetterOffNow than we were two years ago. https://t.co/iP4z368Sib Franklin, Hart, Stephens, and Elbert Counties finally have the ability to petition the @FCC to receive GA satellite TV programming. We have both momentum and more work to do, and I look forward to supporting further #GA09 efforts to access GA news, weather, and sports coverage. https://t.co/GP0lKW8vdF How are Republicans reviving local economies? Since its enactment, #TaxReform has empowered more #GA09 business owners with savings they’re passing on to employees. https://t.co/7ejpak61zd Since the 2016 election, our unified Republican government has multiplied opportunities through #TaxReform and deregulation, giving many Northeast Georgians a chance to get ahead in the workplace. https://t.co/oaFjBwGucY Keeping Americans safe involves securing our borders, enforcing our laws, and opposing violence, and Republicans are working consistently to that end. https://t.co/KSCn41CpCm
