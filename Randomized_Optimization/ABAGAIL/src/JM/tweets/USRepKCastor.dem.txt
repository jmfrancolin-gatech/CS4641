The American people know how pressing #climatechange is. They’re living it. The #TrumpToxicTeam wants to ignore them.

We’re not here to waste time. @HouseDemocrats are doing work in the #116thCongress. 👉 Today the new Democratic majority breaks eight years of silence in the House of Representatives on #climatechange.👈
