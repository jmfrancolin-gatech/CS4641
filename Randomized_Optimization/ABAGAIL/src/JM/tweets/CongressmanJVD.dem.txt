Today, the majority of my New Jersey colleagues and I came together to express our concern with the continued closure of the Atlantic City Rail Line. @NJTRANSIT's failure to meet its own deadlines and lack of transparency is unacceptable. #ACRailLine #AtlanticCity #NJPols https://t.co/OhHKtSs6fq That’s why a majority of my New Jersey colleagues and I are sending a letter of admonishment to @NJTRANSIT. #NJTransit #atlanticcity #SouthJersey #ACRailLine I will continue to put pressure on @NJTRANSIT, to tell the truth to the people of #SouthJersey about and fix the #ACRailLine. I won't stop until we get resolution on this issue. #NJTransit #atlanticcity I have repeatedly tried to get answers from the Executive Director of @NJTRANSIT but have been continuously stonewalled. #NJTransit #atlanticcity #ACRailLine #SouthJersey On Thursday I addressed the House floor to put pressure on @NJTRANSIT, to tell the truth to the people of South Jersey about the AC Rail Line after they promised it would be finished by early 2019, but recently announced it would take up to 5 more months. https://t.co/g3KrKXIYoj @NJTRANSIT promised the public back in September that the project would be finished by early 2019, but recently, it announced that the A.C. Rail Line would be closed for up to 5 more months.

https://t.co/TQbzaGhsbN https://t.co/7BTRBq0GOe Today I was honored to stand with @HouseDemWomen wearing #suffragette white. We hope to send a positive, respectful message that Members of the House are fighting #ForThePeople and advancing women’s economic security. #SOTU #SOTU2019 https://t.co/FM0hvbqGB3 The closure of the Atlantic City Rail line by @NJTRANSIT is affecting so many throughout South Jersey and these delays are unacceptable. The failure of @NJTRANSIT on the AC Rail line is disturbing. I caught up with some people today in the halls of Congress to talk about this failure and how I am going to fight my hardest to get it straightened out. #NewJersey #AtlanticCity #SouthJersey https://t.co/EgooWxbydV This morning on the house floor I addressed Members of Congress about the need to restore faith in our institution and prevent future shutdowns. https://t.co/Y2L1PtNmAG I have fought to protect the lifeblood of the local economy - tourism, fisheries, and wildlife-viewing – by banning offshore oil and gas drilling at the state level, and I will continue to do so at the federal level. I am proud to be appointed to be the House Committee on Natural Resources. South Jersey is rich with natural resources, and in the 2nd Congressional District, the coastal economy and our commercial and recreational fisheries are a large part of life. https://t.co/6IZnHY3AS0 “35 days is too long.

We must continue to be vigilant and stand up to anti-semitism wherever it appears and continue to fight against all forms of hate and bigotry.

I am immediately going to call New Jersey Transit and find out what the hell is going on and respond accordingly,” - JVD https://t.co/iubHS99Ijj "I am glad that a deal has been reached to end the shutdown and reopen the government. Now it is our job to work together and find compromise in a bipartisan way so that the American people do not suffer again." - JVD
https://t.co/BZwXvPuRgp https://t.co/IakPc1R0tR “Our constituents sent us to Congress to put an end to political games and to find bipartisan solutions that move this country forward,” says the letter from Blue Dog Coalition members. Congressman Jeff Van Drew signed two letters to the leadership of both parties and both chambers of Congress urging them to put an end to the political games. https://t.co/78xKdVKZn6 Congressman JVD, along with @RepSherrill , @RepMalinowski, and @RepAndyKimNJ, Urge the U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Acosta to Issue Guidance to Make Essential Federal Workers Eligible for Unemployment Benefits During the Shutdown
https://t.co/78xKdVKZn6 Yesterday, I stood with federal workers in South Jersey that have been affected by the government shutdown. I will continue to vote to open the government but I will also work with anyone who wants to end this mess. https://t.co/HPX25aOz5x Today we honor and remember the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

"The time is always right to do what is right." https://t.co/XQON6kFVMC RT @MariaBartiromo: Today @SundayFutures will repeat at 3pm et @FoxNews pls join us for this Very important discussion @SenJohnHoeven @RepR… Don't forget to tune in tomorrow at 10 AM EST on @FoxNews to watch me on @SundayFutures with @MariaBartiromo!

Loving the #ocean no sign of storm here yet   See you @SundayFutures @FoxNews   10am et join us @… RT @MarkOvermann: Thank you @CongressmanJVD for meeting with our great host employer @MoreysPiers and for your support of the Summer Work T… The Agriculture Committee was one of my top committee choices because it will give me the platform to be an even stronger leader for our hard-working farmers in South Jersey. #NJ02 #agriculture I am proud to have earned a seat on the committee that shapes our nation’s agricultural priorities. #NJ02 #agriculture https://t.co/4694MK5Sdn https://t.co/ruHLDLI3iW I am willing to talk immigration. I am willing to talk border security. I am willing to talk about whatever it takes to open the government and get the American people working again. I am not saying this to create division. I am saying this to create unity as Americans. – JVD @aj_mirabelle This was in reference to the bill I proposed to fund our Coast Guard. As in be a good American and fund our Coast Guard. "It's more important, not to be a good Republican or to be a good Democrat, but to be a good American." - Jeff Van Drew https://t.co/4ZXDB2XQzx It is unacceptable for the men and women who protect us to be treated like second class citizens over partisan bickering. We need to re-open our government. We need to separate these issues. https://t.co/6CwF7CkuFQ I am urging my fellow Congresspeople to support our Coast Guard and support our funding. #PayOurCoastGuardAct The Coast Guard Training Center and FAA William J Hughes Technical Center are two of South Jersey's biggest employers. In South Jersey alone, more than 1,500 brave men and women in the Coast Guard have been affected by the shutdown. The number approaches 1 million Coast Guard members and federal workers nationwide. #PayOurCoastGuardAct Today I addressed the House floor to gain support for the "Pay Our Coast Guard Act" and legislation to fund the FAA during the government shutdown. #PayOurCoastGuardAct https://t.co/x8Mrpzzx4Z I will be addressing the house floor today around 12 PM EST to urge members to immediately bring my bill H.R.350 the "Fund Our Coast Guard Act" to vote. You can watch the house floor live here: https://t.co/fuTqfaouoA #PayTheCoastGuard Today I met with Master Chief Jason M. Vanderhaden and Admiral Karl Schultz to discuss the shutdown and its effects on the Coast Guard as well as the legislation I introduced to fund the Coast Guard during the shutdown. https://t.co/9qdu0EuKWb It is essential to our nations safety and security and the well-being of many families in South Jersey and across the United States. #FAA #CoastGuard #StopTheShutdown I wrote a letter to @SpeakerPelosi and @senatemajldr urging them to support the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) by supporting the bills I introduced to re-open them. #CoastGuard #FAA https://t.co/g00wWnLZis We must come together to end it. #GovtShutdown #NJ02 South Jersey needs the folks at our Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, the Coast Guard Air Station in AC, and the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center in EHT to get back to work for the safety and security of our nation. #CoastGuard #FAA #GovtShutdown #NJ02 We need to separate these issues. We can address the border crisis without this shutdown and the distressing effects it is having on South Jersey and the United States of America. It is unacceptable for the men and women who protect us to be treated like second class citizens over partisan bickering. We need to re-open our government. This is shameful. In my first full week as a Congressman, I introduced legislation to fund the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during the Government shutdown. https://t.co/xw50OriXc4 Democrat or Republican, we are all Americans.
