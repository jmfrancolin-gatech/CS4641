Every person I met at the southern border fled unspeakable violence in search of a safe haven for their kids. You can end this atrocity with a stroke of your pen. https://t.co/uWsyhUDOqJ The President can end it with a stroke of his pen. Call the White House and tell him to end it ‚Äì 202-456-1414. If he won‚Äôt, Congress must. My visit to the southern border in Texas yesterday was heart wrenching. I saw kids locked in chain link cages. I met with distraught mothers sobbing because they don‚Äôt know where their kids are or if they will ever see them again. This policy is shameful. It is un-American. https://t.co/VJamgDlafN .@SecNielsen you can‚Äôt be serious. I just arrived with @SenJeffMerkley at Casa Padre in Brownsville. 1500 boys here. Earlier we saw children in chain link cages. Alone. Not a parent in sight. Shameful. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/5a6CELbvVq
