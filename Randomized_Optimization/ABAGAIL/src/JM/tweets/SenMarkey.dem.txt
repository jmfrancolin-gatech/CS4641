https://t.co/GlrM1oEFEL Drones have the capability to collect treasure troves of sensitive personal information using technologies like facial recognition and automated license plate readers, yet the FAA has failed to establish any baseline privacy protections.
https://t.co/KHoXijc7w7 The census is not a tool to intimidate &amp; marginalize immigrant communities, which is what the Trump admin’s citizenship question was designed to do. This ruling is a victory for justice &amp; democracy, &amp; a defeat for the forces that seek to suppress the voices of American voters. https://t.co/pOUEd3Voet An employer should have exactly zero say in a woman’s reproductive health decisions. This injunction is great news in the fight against the Trump administration’s radical agenda of making being a woman a pre-existing condition. 

https://t.co/TyShkdmOJ0 RT @SenatorCarper: I agree. This hearing can wait. With 95% of its workforce on furlough under the #TrumpShutdown, @EPA should focus its sc… Nearly the entire @EPA workforce is furloughed and without pay.

It makes no sense to consider Andrew Wheeler for a promotion to lead the EPA when the Senate should be focused on getting EPA workers back on the job and paid. His hearing should be delayed until the gov’t re-opens. https://t.co/hQxmDWuqdJ John Bolton misled America into a costly war in Iraq and, along with Sec. Pompeo, is trying to do the same with Iran. This admin withdrew from the Iran deal not because it was the worst deal ever, but because Trump’s war cabinet is spoiling for a fight.
https://t.co/Nkgihlh0Et Honored to join friends and supporters in Roxbury to celebrate the community swearing-in of Massachusetts’ incredible new Representative. I’m proud to fight together! 

Welcome to Congress @RepPressley. https://t.co/x7sTwcOb8C The #TrumpShutdown is now the longest in U.S history &amp; Trump continues to treat thousands of workers like his hostages. Democrats are going to keep doing everything we can to re-open the government because we understand this isn’t a game, this is about real people’s livelihoods. https://t.co/8IXkZZLIGA The Republican paradox: they don’t believe in gov’t, but they have to run for office to shut it down. It’s an ancient animosity for gov’t &amp; for the people it supports - workers, migrants, etc. Trump wants his wall &amp; to win, but the Freedom Caucus just wants to get rid of gov’t. RT @SharmanTV: Federal workers who missed their paychecks say they’re worried about paying for prescriptions, food and their mortgages.  Th… Federal workers should have been getting their paychecks today. Instead, all they are getting is more uncertainty. Today I rallied with furloughed workers to send a message to President Trump and Senate Republicans: end this shutdown. Let folks go back to work, and pay them. Now. https://t.co/tcmUdN2m5r The Republicans’ refusal to do their jobs and end the #TrumpShutdown means that @EPA inspectors can’t do their jobs: protecting American families from pollution. This toxic administration means toxic water and air for our communities.
https://t.co/rUDZjKjqkz The winds of change are blowing off the coast of Massachusetts. Offshore wind can create tens of thousands of jobs along the East Coast and will be an indispensable part of our clean energy future. Great news for Boston.
https://t.co/YscGweOsCj The #GreenNewDeal is an historic opportunity to fundamentally transform our economy and empower all communities. As we transition from fossil fuels to efficient, clean, renewable energy sources like solar, we must ensure that no one is left behind.
https://t.co/OfA5AMjNlL The gov't of Burma is trying to silence the truth by jailing two @Reuters reporters. Instead, it has made them symbols of journalistic bravery.

This ruling is a blow to freedom of expression, but the fight for justice must go on. #FreeWaLoneKyawSoeOo
https://t.co/lK4qGBZKz6 It's impossible to have a healthy planet without healthy oceans. To prevent a climate change catastrophe caused by warming oceans, we only have one choice: control our greenhouse gas emissions &amp; quickly. There's still time before the damage is irreversible
https://t.co/0cZUU5FrdU The Swine Flu epidemic. 9/11. Hurricane Katrina. All declared national emergencies.

Nat'l emergency declarations aren't a tool of political convenience or grandstanding. They are meant to confront real crises &amp; unite the country, not divide it over a manufactured vanity project. Contrary to the President’s remarks this morning, Democrats do care about crime. That’s why we’re trying to pass legislation to prevent President Trump from firing Special Counsel Mueller. The #TrumpShutdown is halting inspections at:

-food processing facilities
-water treatment plants
-chemical factories
-oil refineries

This shutdown is an impending catastrophe. If it goes on much longer, it’s just a matter of time until someone gets hurt or worse. WORK, Inc. is the largest employer of individuals with disabilities in New England under the Federal Ability One Program. It employs hundreds of individuals with significant disabilities. But because of the #TrumpShutdown, they aren’t going to work and they aren’t getting paid. https://t.co/gBERomfuhJ Instead of wasting billions on President Trump’s useless wall, we should invest in the technology that helps those on the frontlines detect and intercept illegal drugs like fentanyl at ports of entry and in the mail. President Trump’s wall would do nothing to stop the flow of illegal drugs, most of which enter this country through legal ports of entry. It is shameful and disgusting that the President is trying to use the real crisis of the #OpioidEpidemic to build support for his vanity wall. RT @SenatorTomUdall: .@Interior should honor the public's voice. They need to extend the comment period on the proposed oil &amp; gas program i… Due to the #TrumpShutdown, @EPA employees are furloughed. The agency is mostly shut down. But Trump is nominating ex-coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to ensure that EPA never works as its mission dictates. It makes no sense to nominate Wheeler now, or ever.
https://t.co/bsOyexIOkc The #TrumpShutdown is forcing the FDA to stop all routine inspections of American food-processing facilities. This shutdown is making Americans less safe.
 
President Trump, Leader McConnell: stop playing games with people’s lives. Re-open the government.
https://t.co/YA4bS3Stho RT @PattyMurray: As the costs of college continue to climb, it’s clear that students are struggling to afford more than just tuition—many a… We can’t just wait for the perfect political circumstances to #ActOnClimate. A regional #GreenNewDeal in New England that can be a blueprint for all of America is within reach, it’s “a matter of will, scale, and speed.” There’s no time to waste.
https://t.co/PWS3L5zeEg No student should have to major in Hunger 101. Passing classes, graduating, and starting a career should be the top concerns of a student – not sacrificing food, housing, textbooks, or other essentials in pursuit of a better life. https://t.co/eZnGrgcoFF Hunger has no place in our college classrooms. New @USGAO report reveals a disturbing amount of state and community college students struggling with food insecurity. We can and must do more to help schools and students.
https://t.co/wWWBS1rVlJ The truth is that there are more Americans today going without their paychecks because of the #TrumpShutdown than immigrants who illegally crossed the southern border in the past two years. 800k federal workers are going without pay. And the longer #TrumpShutdown goes on, the more their worries mount. Mortgages, student loan payments, heating bills, food on the table. Trump may operate from crisis to crisis, but many American families are living paycheck to paycheck To my @SenateGOP colleagues: let’s pass the bipartisan legislation to re-open the government. You supported it before. Support it again. Let’s put people back to work. I’m with my @SenateDems colleagues calling for an end to the #TrumpShutdown. Watch here: https://t.co/B0c13AkBus We’ve proven in the Northeast that it is possible to grow the economy AND cut emissions by transitioning from fossil fuels to efficient, clean, renewable energy. We need to do this everywhere, and we need to do now. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/0OTrqKMBzV Instead of a publicity stunt visit to the border, President Trump should meet with the workers who are going without pay because of his tantrum. They’re thinking about how to make rent and pay bills, not a manufactured border crisis. #TrumpShutdown Fortunately, the @NationalGridUS six-month lockout is ending and 1,250 @Steelworkers can get back to work. But lockouts should never be used as a negotiating tactic. The health and safety of workers and their families should never be used as leverage.
https://t.co/AKiS8kx5pb Our privacy regime is so broken that many simply assume that their data has been shared or sold without their consent. It doesn’t have to be that way. A #PrivacyBillOfRights will ensure consumers, not corporations, have control over their sensitive info.
https://t.co/1Fu9v6MxWA Congress’ only job right now should be to re-open the government. The Senate should not consider any bills that don’t end the #TrumpShutdown. For decades, Exxon may have known about the role fossil fuels play in climate change, hid the evidence, and funded denialism. Great news that the public won’t be denied a chance for justice. Now @MassAGO can get to the truth and find out what Exxon knew.
https://t.co/9Sar0AqJkN It was the negligence of @ColumbiaGasMA that led to the #MVGasFires and the 70 miles of roads and sidewalks that had to be torn up subsequently. It should be their responsibility to ensure all of this infrastructure is repaired.
https://t.co/cJ6hsjpWaq Without the results of this investigation, the people of the Merrimack Valley cannot hope to move forward. The residents of Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover have already had to wait too long for answers; they should not have to wait any longer.
https://t.co/zjkymWXlZe The #TrumpShutdown is resulting in Donald Trump's cronies getting a raise while working people get stiffed.

800,000 federal workers: not getting paid 
Pay raises for all other federal employees: frozen
White House officials: ~$10,000 raises

https://t.co/YKe306jOn1 Welcome to the best delegation in Congress, @RepLoriTrahan! I look forward to working together on big things for Massachusetts. https://t.co/50sfeK9R6N The #TrumpShutdown has shut down the federal investigation into the #MVGasFires and is shutting down justice for the residents of the Merrimack Valley impacted by the disaster. We need to fund government so the @NTSB can complete its investigation.

We must prot… .@SpeakerPelosi is right: climate change is an existential threat. With the new Congress seated, we can get to work on bold legislation like the #GreenNewDeal. I look forward to working w/ the Speaker &amp; all of my colleagues who recognize the urgent need for transformative action. https://t.co/L01kohKAie A universal flu vaccine could save millions of lives and experts think we will see substantial progress toward one in 2019. The $140 million I secured for @NIH research this year will help us get closer to what would be an historic breakthrough.
https://t.co/NQwAyiiKYn Congratulations to my good friend @SenWarren on being sworn-in for a second term in the Senate today! I couldn’t ask for a more dedicated, passionate, and effective partner, and I’m excited to continue to fight side-by-side for the people of Massachusetts and for all Americans. https://t.co/6Zg4BvePgr My CLEARR Act would authorize more than $1 billion in federal funding to help small and disadvantaged communities replace contaminated water infrastructure. I will be reintroducing it in the new Congress. 
https://t.co/EYS5y9JZj5 People have a right to clean water. But millions of Americans are being poisoned by their drinking water as a consequence of negligent regulation. Truly transformational climate action will aim to deliver environmental justice for all.
https://t.co/zwtPpWP1eg RT @SenCoryGardner: The comprehensive Asia policy legislation that @SenMarkey and I authored in the 115th Congress has been signed into law… Mercury. Chloroform. Hydrochloric acid. Trump's EPA says rules on pumping poisons into the air are unnecessary. If you’re waiting for the EPA to protect clean air don’t hold your breath. (But actually hold your breath bc the air may be filled with poison)
https://t.co/pvxhj9szbp Discussion of a #GreenNewDeal is breathing new energy into the movement for climate action. We need to harness this momentum heading into the new Congress.
