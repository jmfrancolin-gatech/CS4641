As far back as 9 years ago, in 2010, 72 migrants making their way to the U.S. were found dead at a remote ranch an hour south of the U.S. border. They were kidnapped by a drug gang. https://t.co/oGrDviK4hY Nearly 2 years to the day (in my district), 10 illegal immigrants crammed into the back of a tractor-trailer died from exposure to blistering heat. https://t.co/mAymc7IRaB Two months ago, 2 Honduran teenagers traveling with a migrant caravan to the U.S. were stabbed and strangled. Mexican authorities believe they were killed after a robbery attempt. https://t.co/VtJazydG1J Only this month, Mexican authorities found the remains of 21 bodies near the border. 17 of them were ‚Äúburned.‚Äù Authorities believed the deaths were caused by gang violence, which has claimed thousands of lives along our border. https://t.co/3K9hktsWRT What Americans see on a day-to-day basis is what is happening North of our border, or in English-speaking media. Americans aren‚Äôt the only ones suffering from our failures. Lives are being taken North and South of our border. An illegal immigrant, using a bank customer as a shield, fired at Johnston. A bullet struck two vertebrae in Johnston‚Äôs neck and left bone spurs near his spinal cord. The swelling left Johnston paralyzed. Johnston died 12 years later. https://t.co/hDNGGj2YXl Jared, Spencer, Tessa, and Allison aren‚Äôt alone. 41-year-old Purple Heart and Medal of Valor winner Don Johnston was shot by an illegal immigrant. Johnston, a police officer, was answering a call at a bank. Prior to killing Tessa and Allison, Ramos ran a cop off the road while drunk. Officers ticketed, sentenced, and fined him. Yet, the local sheriff released him. Tessa‚Äôs mother claims @ICEgov was never contacted. Alfredo Ramos--the immigrant who killed Tessa and Allison--purchased his fake license from a cartel. As was the case with Jared and Spencer‚Äôs respective killers, Ramos was previously arrested. Spencer and Jared are not alone. 16-year-old Tessa Nicole Tranchant and 17-year-old Allison Kunhardt were sitting at a stoplight when an illegal immigrant driving drunk w/ a fake license hit them going over 70 mph. https://t.co/KdAThfpHWr Spencer worked 3 jobs to get the money to re-construct his shop. He did all the construction. Spencer took one night off to take his girlfriend to dinner for her birthday. Now, Spencer‚Äôs parents, Julie and Dan, do not have a son. They do not have their only child to hold. His release ultimately allowed Reyes to brutally murder Spencer and 3 others during a killing spree. The day Reyes took Spencer‚Äôs life was the day that would have been the re-Grand Opening of Spencer‚Äôs newly built-out guitar shop. Reyes was deported multiple times and served 63-months in prison. During his sentence, Reyes nearly killed another inmate. That should have gotten him more prison time. It didn‚Äôt. Why? A judge let him out early. Spencer Golvach was a 25-year-old man from Houston, TX. After dropping his girlfriend off from a birthday dinner, Spencer was sitting at a stoplight in Jan. 2015. Spencer was shot in the head by Victor Rodriguez Reyes, an illegal immigrant from Mexico.  https://t.co/KHbmAZIULU Jared‚Äôs story alone should be enough to make us act.

Here are a few more ‚Ä¶ My constituents and colleagues have heard me tell the story of Jared Vargas, a young man from my district with so much going for him whose life was needlessly taken at the hands of an illegal immigrant. https://t.co/Yr6UWKlyZS The reality is that migrants are being abducted and forced into slavery. Little girls are being sold into the sex trade. Dangerous drugs are flowing across our borders and into our homes. Americans and migrants are dying. Never did I ever think that Congress would let what is happening at the border continue. As @BarackObama accurately noted in 2014, there is an ‚Äúactual humanitarian crisis on the border.‚Äù That is fact, not an opinion or some fearmongering tactic. https://t.co/t2sTan8nrK Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Democrats would hold American national security and sovereignty hostage for 34 days. Never did I think that we would see adults throw temper tantrums over $5.7 billion in necessary spending out of an over trillion spending package.

Nevertheless, millions of Americans‚Ä¶ @woregan2 Thank you for your service.  How did it hurt?  The bill passed and it proves my point it was all for show - as it does not get you your pay now.  If the shut down were real - it would end.  Instead politicians passed this bill so they can keep it going.

I am glad you asked. Read my op-ed here in @Federalist that came out last week. Let‚Äôs #SecureTheBorderNow, end this shutdown, and pay our workers. https://t.co/gT8KgvL9rx This is not a partisan issue. It is a humanitarian crisis for all. Americans should demand our leaders address it today, regardless of party. Let‚Äôs talk more about walls. Walls work. These facts don‚Äôt lie: 
-Israel‚Äîillegal immigration down 99%
-El Paso, Tx‚Äîdown 95%
-Tucson‚Äîdown 90%
-Yuma‚Äîdown 95% 
(h/t @Jim_Jordan) The bottom line is fences have worked since the dawn of time. We currently have 46 miles of reinforced fencing along the San Diego sector of the border. Before construction began in 1986, there were 629,656 arrests. Compare that to 31,891 arrests in 2016. Not a math whiz, but ‚Ä¶ Our men and women at the border are doing their best. @ICEgov has apprehended and removed some 6,000 gang members, including members of MS-13, at the southern border. They deserve and need our help. Since 2011 in Texas alone, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with 462,000 criminal offenses, according the latest update. You could fill up the AlamoDome nearly three times over with those numbers. If sexual assault, violence against migrants, and the opioid crisis isn‚Äôt enough to make us act, consider the criminal impact on American citizens and those legally residing in the United States. In 2017 alone, 882,039 pounds of drugs were seized by the @CBP, and nearly 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. These dangerous opioids and other narcotics have NO business being shipped by illegal criminal organizations onto our streets and into our homes. If sexual assault and violence against migrants are not enough to make us act, think about the massive, unyielding flow of drugs coming across our southern border? As you read this tweet, dangerous fentanyl is making its way into our country. It will ultimately kill Americans.
