https://t.co/uW3LjHcA87 Massive job growth in December: "Nonfarm payrolls surged by 312,000 in December. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting payroll growth of just 176,000... the labor force participation rate increased to 63.1 percent." #JobsReport https://t.co/Qo0auqdvLI On with KC O‚ÄôDea right now discussing border wall funding and the 116th Congress. You can listen live here: https://t.co/qRzfaN1diF The House will be voting on a Democrat funding bill that allocates zero dollars for the wall and has no chance of passing the Senate. I will most certainly be voting against this symbolic bill and hope that Speaker Pelosi will move past it quickly to get to a serious compromise. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer all voted in favor of the SFA. Today, policy has taken a backseat to political symbolism. ‚ÄúThe wall‚Äù is something President Trump thinks is important, and because Democrats loathe the president they want nothing to do with a wall. Back in 2006, a compromise immigration bill called the Secure Fence Act was supported by 90 Democratic members of Congress.  It included funding for "two layers of reinforced fencing" plus "additional physical barriers" along roughly 700 miles of border from California to Texas. President Trump has been clear that he needs $5 billion dollars to start building additional physical barriers on the border. Why? It‚Äôs simple - because insufficient border security is a national security risk for our people. Thread: This morning on the Today Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked if Democrats will support any money for building a border wall. Her answer? ‚ÄúNo. No. No. Nothing for the wall." Now I understand this might be good politics, but how is this in any way a reasonable position? Today, I am honored to once again take the oath of office to uphold the Constitution in the 116th Congress. I am humbled for the continued opportunity to serve #NC13. This week's newsletter--&gt; https://t.co/BuvkrWMacz Tonight we took the first step in securing our Southern Border by funding President Trump‚Äôs wall.  I hope the Senate will follow suit so that we can deliver on a promise that has been made to the American people. There are those that wish to secure our Southern Border with a wall and there are those who, for mostly political reasons, would rather see the government shut down than do any such thing.  Please know that I will be making this case until the very end. If we are not willing to fight for a border wall now, do we really expect there to be a better opportunity when Nancy Pelosi is in power?  Now is the time for us to draw a line in the sand and make a very clear contrast. The fact that we are even considering a bill with zero dollars for the border wall is nothing short of a complete surrender and it is my hope that President Trump will refuse to sign it.  Republicans have control of the House for 14 more days, but we sure aren‚Äôt acting like it. I wanted let you know where I am on the government funding bill the House will be voting on later today:

1 - I will be voting against it. 

2 - I am encouraging President Trump to veto it if it passes. I‚Äôm on right now with Majic 99.9 in Lexington.

https://t.co/Fum7c8Vo2Y RT @NCFarmBureau: Congratulations to @RepTedBudd, who was presented the Friend of #FarmBureau Award at the Rowan County Annual Meeting. #NC‚Ä¶ I wholeheartedly condemn this attack on our Jewish brothers and sisters. There is no place in our society for anti-semitism. 

Amy Kate and I are praying for the families and friends of all those we lost today. My heart is broken for the victims and families of all those we lost today at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania. Places of worship are safe havens for those across our communities. No one should ever enter their place of worship with the fear of losing their lives. The positive economic news keeps on coming: US economy grew at strong 3.5 percent rate in Q3 @FoxNews https://t.co/kSNJ1zScHU Pleased to join Mickey Body in High Point earlier in the week as they celebrated a safety milestone.
