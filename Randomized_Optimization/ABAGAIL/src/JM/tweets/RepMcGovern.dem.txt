One that gives all members of Congress a voice &amp; brings us back to the days where big ideas were actually debated. https://t.co/2jORvOM5XT ‚úÖFifth, it restores inclusion to ensure Congress reflects the diversity of the American people -- people of all backgrounds, including women &amp; the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/KRSMuCf7Uu ‚úÖFourth, it restores budget rules by preventing members of Congress from using the debt ceiling as a political weapon. https://t.co/6o6gKi8CIC ‚úÖThird, it restores oversight and ethics by cleaning up Washington. And it subjects the Trump Administration to something it has never had: real oversight. https://t.co/f3p6NW5yqJ ‚úÖSecond, it restores the legislative process by returning to regular order and abiding by the principle that good ideas should finally be debated and voted on again. https://t.co/ebkUf4jdcQ ‚úÖFirst, it restores the people‚Äôs voice by aligning our agenda agenda with the priorities of the American people. https://t.co/ZQsjAKp1OB Never before has a rules package been developed like this.

Listen in: https://t.co/JwTicCwy6B #ForThePeople https://t.co/0FFiDHPuGw Republicans hold the House, Senate, &amp; White House until January 3rd. They shut this government down &amp; they have an obligation to open it back up. If they continue refusing to do so, @HouseDemocrats will move to responsibly end the #TrumpShutdown on day one of the new Congress. I just tried to bring up a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen the government, but the @HouseGOP wouldnt even recognize me to speak. This is absurd! Federal workers shouldn‚Äôt be held hostage by the president‚Äôs useless and offensive wall that he promised Mexico would pay for.
