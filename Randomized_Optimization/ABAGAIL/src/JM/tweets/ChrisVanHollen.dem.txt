Well done. #SOTU It turns out, #SOTU doesn’t get better the second time around. We mostly heard re-runs of the same division and dishonesty that has become the hallmark of this presidency.

As she said on @MSNBC earlier, the President didn’t promise to hold the American people hostage and put them out of work. He promised to make their situation better. Yet, he has only made life harder for working families. https://t.co/6nrNKlpKmB Today would have been Trayvon Martin’s 24th birthday. For Trayvon, for Freddie Gray, and for far too many others, we have so much work to do.

We must do better. https://t.co/kwpGpOfWvm I just heard that my #SOTU guest, Lila Johnson, is on her way to Capitol Hill! She provides janitorial services at @USDA and was locked out of her job during the shutdown. Please help me raise awareness about the urgent need to provide back pay to federal contract workers! https://t.co/IiH2HQiPFB There will be a number of "takes" after the President's speech tonight. But nothing he says will change the fact that the health of our democracy is eroding because of his constant attacks on our civil liberties, press freedoms, and democratic principles we've fought so hard for. https://t.co/ejpYvXYAa3 Like civil servants, federal contract workers deserve to be made whole after the shutdown. Watch @SenTinaSmith and I talk about why we’re fighting to get our bill across the finish line. And please retweet to spread the word and ensure they receive back pay! https://t.co/amPrMHJlan My #SOTU guest? Maryland’s own Lila Johnson. Ms. Johnson has worked as a cleaning services contractor at @USDA for 21 years, and right now she gets no back pay from the shutdown. I’m working to change that, and I hope her story will inspire my colleagues and the President to act. https://t.co/MkFkTB0nwT Governor Northam: From your neighboring state across the Potomac River, please do the right thing for our region and the country—resign. Your actions have been unacceptable and your explanation inadequate. I worked on the ratification of the INF Treaty as a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Trump’s decision to rip up Reagan’s agreement will harm the U.S. and NATO security while strengthening Putin’s hand. Congress must now pass the Prevention of Arms Race Act.

That’s why strengthening benefits and extending solvency for future generations must be a top priority. #Secure2100 https://t.co/I9brtIzFwP We must keep fighting to secure back pay for federal contract workers, who perform some of the most thankless yet essential jobs that support our government.

We recommit ourselves to fight anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry wherever they raise their ugly heads. Silence and inaction are the accomplices to evil. #HolocaustMemorialDay As we make sure our civil servants get paid, we can't forget about federal service contractors. They too have suffered from the shutdown and are facing mounting bills that many of them can't afford. As these negotiations continue, we cannot forget them. https://t.co/FOjwE12GYA Last night, @SenatorCardin and I introduced a bipartisan funding bill to reopen the government for 3 weeks, get federal workers paid and back to work, and move forward with negotiations. President Trump now supports this idea. Let’s get this voted on today and get back to work. I filed an amendment with a bipartisan group of senators—Cardin, Graham, Warner, Murkowski, Kaine, and others—to fund the government for the next three weeks. It's straight funding with no gimmicks and gives us breathing room to hammer out a long-term solution. Let’s pass it. https://t.co/l9TbftTg3F After today’s failed vote to reopen the government until February 8th, I’m on the floor with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss the need to end the shutdown and find common ground. Tune into our colloquy: https://t.co/OeA2AlCr9g Day 34 of the Trump Shutdown. Under the direction of the President, Senate Republicans blocked a proposal to reopen the government until February 8th. This would have allowed federal employees to get back to work and receive their back pay while we work out a long-term solution. This Administration is so out of touch. There was a long line at @chefjoseandres’ food bank yesterday, and the same is true across my state. Go meet with them, @SecretaryRoss, and you’ll see what living without a paycheck for 34 days does to a family trying to feed their kids. https://t.co/AX6wUMjrRY Damage from the shutdown grows by the day. @SenatorCardin and I met with small business owners to discuss how they are being harmed. Today, we need 60 votes to at least open the government until February 8th and use this time to end the madness. https://t.co/hkPqKigSrS Stopped by @WCKitchen to see the great work @chefjoseandres is doing and meet with furloughed federal workers.

Maryland’s HBCUs produce $1B in economic growth, over 9K jobs, and $9.5B in lifetime earnings. https://t.co/qBeu2iaY2h Tomorrow the Senate should vote “yes” on a narrow proposal to reopen the government until February 8th, pay our civil servants, and find an end to the shutdown. It’s time for Senate Republicans to vote to stop punishing federal workers and the country. https://t.co/Jw3cgOd7Wr This is heartbreaking and enraging. The shutdown has brought domestic violence shelters to the brink—imperiling life-or-death services for women. Mr. President, is this what you meant when you said you would be “proud” to shut down the government? Shameful.https://t.co/JOZRcP9O9J I was on the floor an hour ago insisting that if we vote on President Trump’s proposal we should also vote on the House bill to reopen the government. McConnell just agreed to vote on both. https://t.co/go5oIODAmO It was an honor to celebrate #MLKDay at the @NAACP in Charles County and rededicate ourselves to his mission. Dr. King warned that “progress is neither automatic nor inevitable” and that justice requires “the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals." https://t.co/3UrAWFhrNi Open the government immediately and then let’s have a serious conversation about border security and immigration issues where all sides can present their ideas. Today I joined volunteers to collect food at the Westfield Wheaton @GiantFood for the @MannaFoodCenter. If you're a federal worker impacted by the shutdown, they've waived income requirements for those in need. Thanks to all the volunteers—a great way to honor Dr. King’s legacy. https://t.co/UhImpsxjNO It was great to join activists today ahead of the @WomensMarch. Just this week, the GOP voted to restrict women's reproductive rights instead of ending the government shutdown. You deserve better. That is why we stand together today and continue to fight for a more perfect union. https://t.co/NroRV5AbYk Don’t know what Trump will say tomorrow in his “major” announcement, but the only “Crisis” now is the one he created by shutting down the government. Total abuse of power to claim emergency powers when you are the cause of crisis.

This wasteful, destructive shutdown must come to an end. https://t.co/tb8LwwCIAa Here’s an idea: the Senate should be voting on bills to end the shutdown, not to restrict women’s reproductive rights. This is what happens when you stop working for your constituents and start contracting out your constitutional responsibilities to Trump. This is nuts.

If you or someone you love has been hurt by the shutdown, share your story → https://t.co/p0CaenBbp9 #ShutdownStories As the shutdown continues, we now have an explosive IG report saying the Administration has no idea how many immigrant children were taken from their parents at the border.

So why won’t President Trump sign a bipartisan bill to fund the agency? Unsurprisingly, Andrew Wheeler had no good answer. https://t.co/oy3seuRNxD The good news: 

Our bill to ensure back pay for federal workers has been signed into law. 

The bad news: 

Americans are still being denied services and federal + contract workers are missing paychecks as the GOP holds the country hostage to Trump’s demands.

End this madness! Mr. President, we’re asking you to meet with the federal employees who are working without pay or furloughed because of the shutdown and listen to their stories.

In front of the @AFLCIO, I stood in solidarity with with furloughed federal workers, unions, and grassroots organizations. The @SenateGOP should not be contracting out their constitutional responsibilities to Trump. Last time I checked, we are a separate branch of government. https://t.co/jXRXRJWuNH McConnell refused.

Now the House must act! https://t.co/yB6rdlfdlb De-escalating the Trump Trade War with China should operate on a separate track from holding Huawei accountable for violating our laws. The President shouldn't engage in or tolerate efforts to undermine the rule of law to gain an advantage in a tariff negotiation. Very dangerous. https://t.co/10m3lYsvvk BIG NEWS! The new Farm Bill includes $300M to help restore critical areas like the Chesapeake Bay and important reforms that I introduced in the Chesapeake Bay Farm Bill Enhancements Act. Thanks to @SenPatRoberts, @SenStabenow, and all our partners for working with me on this! In June, a gunman opened fire at @capgaznews and murdered 5 Marylanders: Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters, and Rebecca Smith. The staff still put out a newspaper the next day. And as @chaseacook would say—they have put out a damn paper every day since. https://t.co/tQfiHHzmht For the first time in a decade, @MarylandMSoccer won the National Championship. @SenatorCardin and I are working on a resolution to commemorate the team—in the meantime, please join me in congratulating the Terps on this HUGE win! #FeartheTurtle #TerpsNation https://t.co/1q34hhXzRW RT @CNNnewsroom: Senator @ChrisVanHollen tells @BriKeilarCNN he supports an investigation into the Saudi crown prince’s relationship with J… I’m introducing the Keep Our PACT Act to support our nation’s students.

It’s time we kept our promises to all our students. https://t.co/6a37I2Ovmf We are writing to @SecPompeo about violations of human rights, the breakdown in the rule of law, and elections fraud in Cameroon. We must hold the Cameroonian government accountable for its abuses, including through targeted sanctions and conditions on security assistance. https://t.co/Z9VUebywFK Do you or someone you know need health insurance?

Congratulations to @OSIRISREx on finally reaching asteroid Bennu—now it will survey the land for a sample to bring back to Earth for further examination. Maryland’s own @NASAGoddard is once again a leader in scientific discovery. https://t.co/liU74PGSil It’s always good to be in Prince George’s County! Last week, I hosted a holiday open house in my Largo office to celebrate the season and discuss ways my office can be of help to the community. https://t.co/3xWOeTBHRG After General Motors laid off thousands of American workers while outsourcing jobs to Mexico—it’s even more urgent that Congress act to protect the middle class. From the start, the Trump Tax Scam has been bad news—billions to millionaires while workers reap no benefits. https://t.co/3nhr2Wx50h Using any platform with the intent to tamper with witnesses in a federal investigation is not only an abuse of power but also a crime. I may seem like a broken record, but I’m going to keep saying it: McConnell must allow a vote on the bill to protect the Mueller investigation. https://t.co/F1j6t434Ae George H.W. Bush served our country with dignity, integrity, and a commitment to American values—from his courage in WWII to many other positions in government to the White House. He understood the virtues of civility and mutual respect in public life. He will be greatly missed. People in Maryland and across the country need an advocate at the CFPB who will fight for them—not protect big special interests. Kathy Kraninger is not that person, and that is exactly why I opposed her nomination yesterday. As I’ve traveled across Maryland with @BrianFrosh to host a series of Consumer Protection Forums, I’ve heard from students who are crippled by the cost of college and families who have lost everything because they were scammed by predatory lenders. One of the things that troubled me most was her unwillingness to commit to reestablishing the @CFPB's student lending office to stop the abusive and predatory practices of many entities that have loaned money to students. Kathy Kraninger, President Trump’s nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, came before the Senate Banking Committee back in July, and I had the opportunity to question her on a range of issues. https://t.co/AqMkfFBS22 Because you made your voices heard we now have the votes to block the judicial nomination of Thomas Farr—a person who advocated for North Carolina’s most racially discriminatory voting law since the Jim Crow era. Keep up the fight for justice! https://t.co/GmodOR2JY6 As Cohen pleads guilty and Mueller's investigation gets closer to the truth, Trump says Rosenstein should be jailed for appointing a special counsel. This behavior is telling—and another sign that McConnell must stop blocking a vote on the bill to protect the Special Counsel.

Tune in live: https://t.co/iVplwug3r4 Again, @JeffFlake and @ChrisCoons asked consent to bring up the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act—again, it was shot down by the GOP leadership. Our job is to protect the rule of law, not the White House. We will not retreat from protecting our democracy. https://t.co/OCJCw0IOe7 The Senate received a briefing today from Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis, but the most telling part was who was not there—the CIA director, who reportedly concluded that the Saudi Crown Prince directed the murder of @WashingtonPost journalist Khashoggi.

RT to ask Congress to pass S.2352. Our bill would make big carbon polluters pay for clean-up and return the proceeds directly to the American people. https://t.co/vAh42ww4bC If we knew a disease was spreading, we would act. Yet President Trump and the GOP fiddle as the costs of climate change—in lives lost and property destroyed—continue to mount. https://t.co/JbzXKIIbHY Vibrant communities require successful small businesses. At a time when big corporations threaten to squeeze out local entrepreneurs, we have to support our resilient small businesses in Ellicott City and beyond—not only today, but throughout the year.
https://t.co/D88BZYi1F8 Happy #SmallBusinessSaturday! Small businesses are the cornerstone of Maryland’s economy, driving job growth and spurring innovation. I hope you’ll join me in supporting them today → https://t.co/KjJDZ8880o. #ShopSmall https://t.co/Dg5tI6MfhB This Thanksgiving, I am grateful for family and friends as well as all the activists who have worked to protect our democracy and build a more perfect union. Also, I am learning the virtue of patience as Katherine and I await the turkey. Don’t put too much Old Bay on that turkey! https://t.co/ZHRDert0x2 President Trump says “the world is a very dangerous place!” Yes, and made much more so when the President of the United States winks at a foreign leader the CIA says is responsible for murdering and dismembering an American-based journalist.

Last year, Republicans were talking about winning 60 seats in the Senate. Instead, they lost in 8 states Trump won, and picked up no seats in states he lost. https://t.co/iriEuMc5uI If brought to a vote right now, I am confident that the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act would pass the Senate on a bipartisan basis. So why does Mitch McConnell continue to block any attempt to bring it to a vote? https://t.co/WGl2JBoT3C Congress took a huge step forward by establishing a program to pay all our interns so we can open the doors of opportunity to every American. I was honored to receive the Congressional Champion Award from @PayOurInterns—their hard work was critical in securing this victory. https://t.co/GhZtnwrb04 RT @TomPerez: Glad to know Obamacare covers sick burns like this one. https://t.co/wQZUoUyNPY No one stays young and invincible forever, just ask @TomPerez. Make sure you #GetCovered by December 15th: https://t.co/7Ivj3NdZzg. #TBT https://t.co/JNe3ZJAmyC Sadly this comes as no surprise—big corporations are pocketing their billions in tax cuts instead of investing in their workers or creating jobs. And American taxpayers will be left to foot the $2T bill. Congress should be looking out for their constituents, not ripping them off. https://t.co/NrxM2khjEX The Special Counsel's investigation is critical to the health of our democracy. There is a bipartisan bill to protect Mueller’s work that could pass in the Senate today. One person is standing in the way: Senator Mitch McConnell. Time to put country first and allow a vote. https://t.co/BBDgqLAHyQ It is an undeniable fact that climate change is making wildfires more destructive. As we mourn the loss of over 40 Americans, we must stand with California as they recover and come together to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate greenhouse gases. https://t.co/74TMq658kR Welcome to the Senate, @kyrstensinema! It’s not always easy to get things done, but Kyrsten knows we must look for ways to work together across party lines. This was a well-deserved win and I know you’ll make Arizona proud in the U.S. Senate. It was an honor to speak at the Vietnam Veterans Day of Service in Baltimore. Our Vietnam veterans never received a proper welcome home and we must renew our commitment to support all our veterans, not only through our words but also our deeds. #VeteransDay18 https://t.co/1nOpvpsMqF Today marks 100 years since the end of WWI. As we honor Marylanders like Private Gunther, the last person to die in that war, we must reaffirm our commitment to countering the dangerous ultra-nationalist forces that are on the rise around the world again. https://t.co/3WHSN0djG4 This week we again witnessed the horror of a mass shooting. Today, after attending the memorial service for Senator Joseph Tydings, I can’t help but reflect on this @nytimes piece from 1970.  Every Member of Congress should channel his courage and stand up to the gun lobby. https://t.co/cZcYuQJ0J6 Last night I stood with Marylanders to demand that Mitch McConnell allow a full Senate vote on the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act next week. Republican leadership must stop bowing down to President Trump and start standing up for the Constitution. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/XRGnkl97Im Despite the Trump Administration's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, it's still the law of the land. As we keep fighting back against efforts to end protections for people with pre-existing health conditions—make sure you #GetCovered: https://t.co/7Ivj3NdZzg Every American must put country before party to protect the rule of law. Hope you can join me at 5PM today at the Silver Spring Civic Center to demand that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan call upon Whitaker to recuse himself and vote this week to protect the Mueller investigation. https://t.co/IDNJO67GTL I’m sick to my stomach. My heart goes out to the victims and families killed in Thousand Oaks. We can’t accept these horrible acts of violence and terror as inevitable. With the new Congress we must defeat the gun lobby and pass common-sense laws to save lives. Matthew Whitaker, who is taking over for Sessions and will oversee the Mueller investigation, is on the record pushing to limit the Special Counsel’s probe. He must recuse himself immediately, and McConnell must allow a vote on the bipartisan bill to protect the Special Counsel. https://t.co/1rTabbgPOl Beware: now that President Trump has removed Jeff Sessions, the next shoe to drop will be to remove Rod Rosenstein from overseeing Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Trump will want his crony in charge of watching Mueller. This is a total abuse of power! .@SenatorTester’s values are Montana’s values—whether it’s standing with veterans, fighting for farmers, or helping people who need affordable health care. He’s worked for the people of his state from day one, and we’re so happy he’ll continue the fight in the Senate. https://t.co/IPnwmUcgJ4 Congratulations to my partner in the Senate, @SenatorCardin and @WhipHoyer, @RepCummings, @Call_Me_Dutch, @RepSarbanes, @RepAnthonyBrown, @RepRaskin, and our newest House member @DavidJTrone. Glad to have this federal Democratic team fighting for our country in Congress. Jacky is one of the hardest workers I know. She waited tables to put herself through college and broke a glass ceiling by building a career as a computer programmer in a field dominated by men. Now @RosenforNevada will bring that same fighting spirit to Congress. Farmers. Manufacturers. Veterans. Working Families. There is simply no one in the state of Wisconsin who @SenatorBaldwin isn’t fighting for. Her voice is critical in the Senate, and we’re lucky to have her back next year! Michigan is lucky to have @SenStabenow. From protecting the Great Lakes to bolstering our farmers to improving mental health services, Debbie is a proven leader we can all count on. https://t.co/Bcg7ncxA6C From the opioid crisis, to protections for people with pre-existing conditions, to Medicare and Medicaid, @SenBobCasey has always been a leader in the Senate. I’m thrilled the people of Pennsylvania have elected him for another term. West Virginia and @Sen_JoeManchin go hand in hand. He is an independent voice and an unmatched fighter for his state, and they are lucky to have him in the Senate—as are his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. There is no better fighter for workers than @SenSherrodBrown. I’m so glad he will be with us in the Senate next year as we fight for people in Ohio and across the country to have better jobs, higher wages, and fair trade.
