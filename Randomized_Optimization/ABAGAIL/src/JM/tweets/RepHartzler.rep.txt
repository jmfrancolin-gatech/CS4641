(2/2) Among other things, #GreenNewDeal wants to end air travel and "upgrade" every building in the U.S. The radical left continues to focus on its extreme agenda, once again ignoring the life and death problems America faces (like illegal drugs pouring over border). #NoDeal (1/2) You can’t make this up. #GreenNewDeal should be called the Green New STEAL → a socialist manifesto that proposes we steal dollars and jobs from hardworking Americans to reward those who are “unwilling to work.” (2/2) Sex trafficking crimes are a growing epidemic in America that must be dealt with swiftly. Law enforcement needs the necessary tools to protect our families and children, and this bill helps address the problem. (1/2) Today I introduced H.R. 1110, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill would help law enforcement agencies fight sex trafficking demand by giving them access to federal grants through the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program. It was great to speak to members of the @STLRegChamber last night during their visit to Washington. https://t.co/fubo6ErKx3 I enjoyed discussing Tricare for National Guard technicians with the Association of Civilian Technicians Show-Me Chapter. https://t.co/k8KfgA4daR I had an informative meeting this week with the Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program (a part of @DEAHQ) about their efforts to confront the drug epidemic in the Midwest. https://t.co/jgfntGvb8b It was a pleasure to host the hardworking state senators and representatives in #MO4 district on Monday for my first every Working Together for Missouri Summit. We talked about the intersection between state and federal government and how we can work together to accomplish more. https://t.co/ghJoyWtjEv I enjoyed checking out the cockpit of an F-18 and getting to see the advanced F-15 production line at the @Boeing facility in St. Louis last week. https://t.co/wUmVEwqyJc Inspiring #nationalprayerbreakfast with @christomlin leading worship, Gary Haugen w/ Intl. Justice Mission as Keynote, &amp; @POTUS speaking challenging us to not grow weary in doing good whether fighting human trafficking, protecting life, or sharing the love of #Jesus. #endslavery https://t.co/7lIpmtgTjj Today I supported H.R. 66, a bill that would commemorate the centennial anniversary of Route 66, a national treasure that has, for decades, attracted visitors to Missouri from all 50 states and countries around the world. This bill will help us properly celebrate this landmark! Tonight @POTUS laid out an optimistic agenda to unify our country and move America forward. See full statement below ↓ https://t.co/hRi5HOChDi What were your favorite commercials during the #SuperBowl2019 ?  I liked the Audi w/Grandpa ad, the Amazon ad w/ Harrison Ford &amp; his dog, and the @NFL players at a banquet ad. #BestSuperBowlAds So far @SuperBowl LIII is about as exciting as watching water freeze 👀❄️😴😴😴. Would have been a lot more exciting with the @Chiefs and @Saints ! 🏈 Am wearing my @Chiefs shirt while reluctantly watching the #SuperBowl2019 .  Feel we should be watching a game between the KC Chiefs &amp; @Saints ! 😉🏈👍🏻Hope to see some good commercials! Russia has been violating the INF Treaty for yrs &amp; China has built missiles unconstrained. By withdrawing from the outdated INF Treaty, America will be on a needed level playing field to meet today’s strategic threats. #nationaldefense Yesterday’s extreme sanctions by the @NCAA are unfair and need to be reversed. Read my statement here→ https://t.co/3b6jJNq1Ko #MIZ #MidMissouri On Wednesday I was presented with the Legislator of the Year Award by the @akcdoglovers. What an honor! https://t.co/HOQCJyCtVB It was great meeting Johanna Erich, an exchange student from Germany, to discuss her interest in the U.S. legislative process. https://t.co/4v7AzS9520 This week I had the opportunity to meet with military and veteran advocate Richard Glickstein to discuss the important issues of PTSD and veteran suicide. https://t.co/QM5RPIori3 Early on Tuesday, I met with @usairforce Secretary Heather Wilson to discuss Air Force priorities. This meeting was especially important because of my new position as ranking member on the Tactical Air &amp; Land Forces Subcommittee on the @HASCRepublicans Committee. https://t.co/6zCwFQSc9D Dems said they would negotiate on a border barrier if the government reopened. @POTUS has reopened the govt, but Dems have yet to keep their word → he called their bluff, but we see no #compromise. #SecureOurBorder I enjoyed meeting with Brian Lehman of the @MissouriCorn Leadership Program to discuss agriculture issues. https://t.co/aIBc2Vy427 Stay warm! ❄️⛄️ https://t.co/AtQ6prUlrV Today at a House Armed Services Committee hearing I spoke to Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood about the urgent problem of drugs pouring through our southern border. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/qUHreBFLbC It was great to be able to visit with Dan and Shelia Cockman of Advantage Hearing Aid Center, Inc. in Harrisonville to hear about the great service they are providing to their community. https://t.co/xGH0xNnzlz A big thank you to the Lyme Association Greater Kansas City, Inc for stopping by to discuss how we can work together to raise awareness about #LymeDisease. As a member of the Congressional Lyme Disease Caucus, it is my pleasure to work alongside them on this issue. https://t.co/6brirG98IY According to @DHSgov, the construction of physical barriers has reduced the number of illegal border crossings in multiple states → in San Diego for example, where there has been a border wall since 1992, illegal traffic has dropped 92% over the last 23 years. https://t.co/B5drpVBVDZ I am honored to be selected by @MacTXPress as ranking member of the Tactical Air &amp; Land Forces Subcommittee. This new position will compliment the vast military interests of #MO4 and in it, my goal will be to restore the readiness &amp; capability of our air and land forces. It’s a shame @SpeakerPelosi is refusing to consider compromise from @POTUS to reopen govn + ensure Americans' safety + give DREAMERS more certainty. Missed paychecks are devastating to our 800,000 dedicated federal wrkrs, many of whom make less than $50K/year. #compromise Starting tomorrow, Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices will be open and able to provide additional services for farmers &amp; ranchers. Thank you @SecretarySonny &amp; @usdafsa employees for your dedication &amp; for keeping the promise to "do right and feed everyone." https://t.co/xRBSzmTfho Today we celebrate a man who consistently stood up for what is just, refused to get discouraged by the odds, and challenged our nation to do what was right even when it was uncomfortable. Happy #MLKDay! https://t.co/n5n8CUDwBq Heartbreaking loss for KC @Chiefs fans 🏈 but congrats on a BIG SEASON!  You gave us a lot to cheer for🎉 and made us in Chiefs Territory proud. 👍🏻🏈 What an #AFCChampionship !  Go, @Chiefs !!🏈🏈 Excited to watch the @Chiefs play for the #AFCChampionship!  Will be a legendary game between Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady. I’m cheering for Patrick and the Chiefs!! 🏈 @POTUS offer is reasonable approach to securing our border &amp; reopening government. It provides security with a barrier combined w/ tech, canines, more border agents, &amp; $800 m humanitarian asst. plus grants new status for #DACA &amp; TPS recipients. Senate should pass the compromise! Thrilled that @POTUS today promised to abstain from signing any legislation that weakens current pro-life federal policies and laws.

Pictured from left to right are: Lydia Murphy (a @Mizzou student), myself, Jaclyn McLean (a @LibertyU student), Max Beckert (who is from New Zealand and just finished his Law and Commerce Degrees), and Andrew Blackmore (also at Liberty). https://t.co/AMT7gVhMDE Enjoyed attending a Women of Congress Defense Breakfast this morning w/ Heather Wilson, @SecAFOfficial. Discussed needs of our airmen and new processes in the @usairforce encouraging innovation. Very encouraging. She’s providing great leadership! https://t.co/VsAMPz2Gq8 I am thankful for our rich, spiritual heritage as we observe #ReligiousFreedomDay.

Go Eagles! https://t.co/8K5zIuvqG7 “Chief Ortiz’s sector apprehended illegal immigrants from 43 countries other than Mexico or countries in Central America. We absolutely have a crisis at the border… even President Obama said as much in 2014.” - @RepDanNewhouse #SecureOurBorder “Combined with 21st century surveillance technology and increased border agents, a barrier is an effective defense against criminals, gang members, drug-smugglers, and yes, even terrorists.”- @RepMarkGreen #SecureOurBorder “I find it hypocritical that Speaker Pelosi has talked about walls being immoral when she has spent half of her life being protected by those very walls.” - @RepArrington #SecureOurBorder “To curb the flow of drugs into our communities, we must secure our southern border. There’s no doubt we need a comprehensive solution.” - @RepWalberg #SecureOurBorder “Bottom line: whatever we’re doing for border security isn’t working. We must do more...300 Americans every week are killed by heroin, and 90% of that heroin comes across that southern border.” - @RepRickAllen #SecureOurBorder “It’s a humanitarian and national security crisis. It’s been ignored for far too long… Kate Steinle, killed in San Francisco with her family, Jamiel Shaw from southern California, needlessly killed.... all mowed down by illegal immigrants.” - @RepLaMalfa #SecureOurBorder “We are in the midst of a crisis on our southern border and it’s time for our colleagues across the aisle to stop playing politics and focus on our national security.” - @RepCarolMiller #SecureOurBorder Update: I will speak on the Floor at approximately 7:10 ET Tune into @CSPAN around 7:30 pm ET tonight to hear what my House colleagues and I have to say about border security. #SecureOurBorder I appreciate the dedicated lineman working to restore power after the big #2019snow!! ❄️❄️. I also appreciate the snow plow operators and first responders helping those who have slid off the road. #besafe https://t.co/1J30E0YFpg Go @Chiefs !! Will be watching from home and cheering for a BIG WIN over the Colts today!! 🏈 Today I supported a bill to pay all federal workers affected by the partial govt shutdown at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends. Inaction by Congress to solve our border issues should not result in causing some federal workers to go without pay. Tonight I had the opportunity to speak on the House floor about the urgent issue our open border presents, and how it is hurting Americans and communities here at home and immigrants who fall prey to traffickers. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/IcY22xOy7E In wake of the partial government shutdown, today I requested that the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) withhold my Congressional pay “until an appropriation agreement to fund the entire government has taken effect.” The CAO has granted my request. https://t.co/tuUDikElb2 On @POTUS's speech last night, I agree: open borders have caused lives of loved ones to be stolen, women &amp; children to be victimized by traffickers, &amp; drugs to be leaked into MO communities. Submitting to the status quo is hurting our American way of life &amp; it can't continue. Privileged to hear from @vp about the humanitarian and border security crisis &amp; why we need to address both ASAP. @POTUS is negotiating in good faith. It’s time for the democrats to do the same. #ProtectOurFamilies. #StopDrugs https://t.co/Fm9itL4mC0 Glad @POTUS is going to address the American people tonight about the #BorderCrisis. It’s imperative we stop the drugs pouring into our communities which kill our kids. Plus we need to ensure immigration laws are followed &amp; our families are kept safe. It’s time to #BuildTheWall. RT @FRCdc: .@RepHartzler identifies the major problem with the Democrat’s funding bill, that it strips away essential protections for young… The economy continues its strong performance, adding 312,000 jobs this month. Unemployment is at an 18 year low. Good things happen when we roll back burdensome government regulations. https://t.co/Yz0xwKID5Q Today the Democrat majority in the House advanced bills that fail to address our rapidly growing border problems. Their bills ignore the need for increased border security &amp; kick the can down the road, advocating for the failed status quo that first caused this predicament. Today I was sworn into my fifth term as U.S. Congresswoman for the 4th District of Missouri. I am honored to once again have the opportunity to serve and represent the people of #MO4. It is a privilege to be their voice and to fight for our shared values and common sense ideas. https://t.co/hpgSmT3mnN So proud of the men &amp; women of @Whiteman_AFB who enabled the #B2Bomber to kick off the @RoseParade! Awesome! https://t.co/u5i1wGcUBp Happy New Year! May you have a blessed 2019. https://t.co/lN7CbWmVQI Excited my @Mizzou Tigers🐯 are playing in the #LibertyBowl today!  🏈Looking for a BIG WIN over Oklahoma State!  Go, Tigers!! 🐯🐯 In a world that often is full of bad news, it's refreshing to remember angels delivered a message of “Good News.” I’m so grateful for it. I hope you get to celebrate the birth of Jesus this Christmas with friends &amp; family and experience His love &amp; presence throughout the year. https://t.co/be1CVY96SA (2/2) I encourage Democrats to support legislation that funds our government &amp; prioritizes our security by increasing funding to protect our border, stops flow of deadly drugs into our communities, &amp; stems tide of illegal immigration. I stand by, ready to support such a measure. (1/2) On December 20 I voted for a CR to fund entire govt through February 7, that included much needed border security funding for @DHSgov while also funding other select federal agencies. Unfortunately, the Senate did not reach the required sixty votes necessary to approve it. Pleased to support the First Step Act that @POTUS just signed into law → this bill works to reduce recidivism and give certain non-violent prisoners a second chance when they reenter society. Great step in the right direction. I fully support @SteveDaines call to fund government &amp; #BuildTheWall by changing the unconstitutional 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate. The American people gave us the Majority. We need to quit squandering this opportunity to fulfill their wishes. #MajorityRules Pretty shot of Capitol I took tonight after voting to build the wall, provide disaster relief, and fund our government. We must stop the drug cartels from bringing drugs into our country which kill our kids. Calling on Senate to pass it tomorrow. #bordersecurity #stopdrugcartels https://t.co/V8dZO7xmGu .@POTUS continues his promise of supporting Missourians and agriculturalists across our country by signing the bipartisan #2018FarmBill into law today. Pics below of our signing the bill before it went to the President. https://t.co/aax24HnQbX Pleased that last night the House moved to authorize $20 million annually for Alzheimer’s research and prevention. Especially meaningful since my own mom passed away from Alzheimer’s complications in 2015. Witnessed a great speech by a great American @speakerryan.  He reflected on accomplishments &amp; challenged us to lift our gaze &amp; tackle the challenges yet before us. I’m thankful I had the privilege of serving w/ him &amp; wish he &amp; his family well in next chpt of life.#farewelladdress https://t.co/0RIQA31cUv We need to #BuildTheWall!  I’ve visited the border &amp; seen the danger. Cartels are bringing billions of $ of drugs across our open border which come to our communities &amp; kill our kids. This must stop! #SafetyFirst #FundTheWall I enjoyed making Christmas 🌲 sugar #cookies this afternoon with Tiffany!! Now it feels like #christmas! 🎅🏼We’re going to have fun sharing them with friends and family (&amp; eating them!😉🍪#seasonofgiving https://t.co/mpK64CB4F1 Wishing a very happy 382nd birthday to the @USNationalGuard today! https://t.co/oXA87eeGpl Thank you for everyone’s kind remarks and support. It means a lot. ❤️ @bobvansandt Thank you, Robert. House passage of the #2018FarmBill conference report today provides much needed certainty for producers and consumers alike. While we didn't achieve all that we wanted in the final version, this legislation is a positive step for farmers, ranchers, consumers and rural America. https://t.co/Xpy8zrFYeu @RepAndyBiggsAZ Thank you, Andy. Today my Daddy, Ted Zellmer, went to heaven. 🕊 I will miss him but am so thankful I had all these years with him. What a gift. 🎁 During his life he raised lIvestock🐷, crops🌽, a church, and 2 daughters who love God, love others, and love our country. 🇺🇸 What a #blessing.🙏🏻 https://t.co/XXlzhGz0Qk After months of working with fellow conferees on behalf of rural America, I am proud to sign the #2018FarmBill and provide much needed certainty for producers and consumers both in Missouri and across our nation. https://t.co/vfsSh3NOLY Pleased the House voted last night to make common-sense reforms for our nation's veterans and servicemembers, S. 2248, the Veterans Benefit and Transition Act of 2018. We need to strengthen the way we care for those who have served and those who still serve our country today. Pleased to announce that @POTUS signed into law the bill I authored to rename the downtown Columbia Post Office in honor of MO fallen soldier Spc. Sterling Wyatt. Sterling’s service to his country set an amazing example to the rest of our nation, and he is worthy of this honor. https://t.co/rWxCV28Vji Today marks 77 years since the attack on our naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1941. Take a look at these iconic pictures of that infamous day and take a moment to remember the 2,400 American lives that were lost. https://t.co/uEwxvtZzjr I applaud the @USDOL's recent actions to allow groups, associations, and sole proprietors to sign up for association health plans (AHPs).

My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family at this time. (1/2) I was saddened to learn of the news that President George H.W. Bush had passed. “Bush 41,” as he was affectionately known, served his country in WWII as a combat pilot, then as an envoy to China, U.S. Representative, CIA Director, VP, and finally President of the U.S. @RepKevinYoder @sharicedavids You’re a class act, Kevin. We are going to miss you! Congrats to @WayTigerPR school district on receiving $1.25M federal grant from @DeptofDefense to fund their Educating our Digital Generation Effectively program! The  #EDGE program will allow Waynesville R-VI students to grow into the digital age with robotics and #STEM programs. https://t.co/vFTRCraZDj I’m pleased with @POTUS’s signing today of the #USMCA → We are moving in the right direction in providing certainty for our farmers, consumers, businesses and workers across the nation.

Sterling Wyatt, who was killed by an IED blast in 2012. His name is etched into our post office will inspire future generations &amp; commemorate his patriotism forever. As part of Missouri's capitol renovation project, the statue of Ceres is being removed from the building this morning for restoration.

https://t.co/SQPr7DcclK https://t.co/pq9c0q5y4I I was honored to join representatives from @BurrellCenter in a press conference where they discussed federal grant #opioidepidemic resources which are being used to provide additional services to families in southwest and mid Missouri #DrugFreeMO https://t.co/5EoFJXoM0r Cutting govt regs is key to economic growth. In 2018 alone, 176 outdated, unnecessary, or duplicate regulatory actions were eliminated, resulting in a savings of $23 billion in regulatory costs. https://t.co/BA0SbRyHNV Encouraged to see MO Ag Director @chrischinn advocating for rural broadband at the White House. Together we can expand broadband in Missouri. https://t.co/SRrHFkljoE #YLS2018 was a great success! Thank you to all the students who were able to attend and hear from our wonderful speakers. And thank you to @Mizzou for being such a great host https://t.co/3k6fxmTHdW Our last speaker for #YLS2018 was Col. John Clark (Ret.), a real life hero and Vietnam War #veteran who was shot down and spent six years as a POW. His life of service and sacrifice is the definition of true leadership https://t.co/aQTnTbKDg8 During National School Lunch Week, we applaud the hard work put into the program to ensure children have access to healthy meals. 

Let’s decrease regulatory burdens on our communities and return authority to our local school districts: https://t.co/U4WmshDMA9 Major Allison Barkalow from @Whiteman_AFB speaking on how the hard work ethic she learned growing up on a farm developed her leadership skills that she uses as the 509th Bomb Wing Munitions Squadron Commander #YLS2018 https://t.co/JS2UjHbenX Our students participating in the group activity to learn more about their personalities and how to interact with others with different characteristics #YLS2018 https://t.co/laZlc6mzdm .@MizzouWrestling head coach @mutigerstyle discussing the steps needed for someone to become a great leader #YLS2018 https://t.co/UyT8oJWiRO Thank you @umsystem President Choi for kicking off my 5th Annual Youth Leadership Summit. Excited for all our high school students here to learn how they can be great leaders in their communities #YLS2018 https://t.co/jMQxHTaiVl I recently visited the border and this is what I saw: 
https://t.co/zuXzdTI97r @HouseAgNews Thank you!  It was a good day. I’m looking forward to another year advocating for American agriculture with my friends on the Ag Committee! 🌽🐖🐄 Rejoicing that Pastor Brunson has been released!  So glad this American pastor, who was wrongly charged by the Turkey government, is free!! #FreePastorBrunson #PowerOfPrayer #ReligiousFreedom So proud of Missouri’s Task Force 1 and Boone Electric Coop for the life-saving work they are doing in the wake of Hurricane Michael. https://t.co/0tDp8zjPtw Happy National Farmers Day! I am so thankful for our #MO4 farmers who help produce food for America and the whole world. https://t.co/134i3GLSYi #DrugFreeFriday Marijuana use has been associated with higher levels of opioid pain medication abuse for trauma patients in post operative settings

https://t.co/8tTaRqXxMp .@POTUS announcement about year-round sale of E15 is great news for Missouri corn growers suffering from low commodity prices &amp; drought. As recently as 2 weeks ago, I advocated with White House for this change → so I was particularly glad to hear the announcement today. So glad to see this playground got what it needed and that SCOTUS ruled the government must not discriminate against organizations because they are religious! https://t.co/cHqfvunY18 The Senate has done its due diligence in investigating Judge Kavanaugh, and they have found no evidence against him. Furthermore, this was turned into an embarrassing display of partisan vitriol. I support his confirmation and am pleased the Senate has acted accordingly. It was my pleasure to attend the Committee of Fifty Luncheon recognizing Corporal Hercules Knight, the 2018 FLW Joint Service Junior Enlisted Service Member of the Year at Fort Leonard Wood. He is just one example of the young talent coming out of Fort Leonard Wood! https://t.co/S3O3QefaEU Today I had the opportunity to visit with Ben Cast, president of Lowe Boats in Lebanon, MO to discuss #trade and #tariffs. I’m so glad to have such a wonderful manufacturer in #MO04! @LoweBoats1 https://t.co/s26h3LgcBx Tick tock! My newsletter goes out at 4:00. Sign up at https://t.co/jhMqGahJjj #FridayFeeling https://t.co/eBh8Yr1sxJ I appreciate all the wonderful manufacturers who make such great products right here in #MO4. Happy Manufacturing Day! https://t.co/P2KaKeE8im Thrilled to hear that unemployment hit a 49-year low in September! #BetterofNow https://t.co/ktMuFZiFJS As a former public school teacher for 11 years in Lebanon and Belton, MO, I appreciate the dedication and energy it takes to be in a classroom day in and day out. From one teacher to another—thank you for everything you do! https://t.co/pbJkNgRAua Did you know that more youths are in treatment for marijuana abuse or dependence than for the use of alcohol and all other drugs? #DrugFreeFriday #DrugFreeMO DYK: The FDA has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication.

https://t.co/v9t59B6TXI We’re still waiting for important federal nominees to be confirmed. In fact, compared to the past four previous Administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees. https://t.co/YNinReayVV Glad to see College of the Ozarks featured on @foxandfriends this morning. Hard Work U is a great MO institution where students not only get a great education but learn the value of hard work, patriotism, and life propelled by faith. @CofOHardWorkU Glad to hear the Show-Me State will have more time to comply with REAL ID requirements. Missouri-issued driver’s licenses will continue to be valid at airport security, federal facilities, and military bases through August 1, 2019. https://t.co/7I1Z2KKy5J I'm pleased to announce that families of service members killed in action, like Christopher Stark, will now receive full life insurance benefits due to provision I authored and helped pass in the 2019 NDAA, which was signed into law in Aug. Learn more at→https://t.co/ZCMHMl83VM https://t.co/C3W8J2VD5T Congratulations to the KC @Chiefs on their big win over the Denver Broncos!  🏈What a great #MondayNightFootball debut for QB @PatrickMahomes5!  I enjoyed cheering them on! 🏈🏈#GoChiefs I'm pleased w/ new NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico. Particularly pleased that Canada is willing to open their dairy markets→ the 241% tariff imposed on our fluid milk compared to the 0% tariff the U.S. imposed on Canadian milk was an injustice that needed to be rectified. Welcome home Missouri Task Force 1! I am so thankful for and proud of your work around the clock to help with search and rescue after Hurricane Florence. @BooneCountyFire https://t.co/bOZoVgRxo2 Today the House passed and I supported a comprehensive package to combat the opioid epidemic. In the past year, 11.8 million people misused opioids. Legislation to combat this crisis cannot come too soon. It's Friday and time for my weekly newsletter. If you'd like to see what I have to say about this week, sign up at https://t.co/jhMqGahJjj https://t.co/hIt3dQFyfc Today, I talked about the recently passed FAA Reauthorization Bill, which includes a provision to allow the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to use counter drone technology to detect and monitor drones that pose a threat to the safety and security of our nation. https://t.co/vpOs7fz944 The average user of medical marijuana, contrary to popular belief, does not have a chronic illness and very few of them have cancer, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, or multiple sclerosis #DrugFreeFriday #DrugFreeMO (Cited: National Association of Drug Court Professionals) I enjoyed seeing Darrel and Shonette Koebel, my Angel in Adoption nominees, again Wednesday as we talked about the adoption process and ways we can make adoptions easier and more affordable. https://t.co/dfUEMp1gSa I was happy to recognize my Angel in Adoption nominees from #MO4, Darrel &amp; Shonette Koebel. They have 11 kids: 4 biological, &amp; 7 adopted from foster care and Ukraine → they have devoted their lives to giving children a loving family, and I am so thankful for them! @CCAInstitute https://t.co/PZKLYRn5vi Last night I supported and the House approved an appropriations “minibus” funding bill, which included key Missouri priorities that I have been working on this year. See screenshot for a list of #MO4 priorities ↓ https://t.co/DO2GKoIIXC RT @CatSzeltner: .@RepHartzler calls the cancellation of the FDA contract with fetal tissue firm Advanced Bioscience Resources an "encourag… Last night the House passed the FAA Re-Authorization Act, which contained my provision to combat terrorist drones. Currently many federal agencies are prohibited from engaging with drones to prevent criminal or accidental incidents from happening → my provision fixes this. I enjoyed meeting with the President and Vice President of @stlouisfed to discuss its mission, monetary policy, and our current economic conditions. https://t.co/UIYrHSZRil Yesterday I chaired an Oversight &amp; Investigations Subcommittee @HASCRepublicans hearing on U.S. strategy in Syria. We discussed our objectives in Syria, which include defeating ISIS &amp; al-Qa’ida and deterring the use of chemical weapons. https://t.co/JWsR5W9Gl0
