I joined @SenatorRisch @SenCoryGardner &amp; @SenateMajLdr on bill w bipartisan measures to boost security coop w Israel &amp; Jordan &amp; to sanction Assad regime.

Senate must pass this bill soon. https://t.co/iQm3uIj2zn The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement.

Thank you @WMBBTV for covering --&gt; https://t.co/NkhKMZ0HWe Famed Chinese photojournalist Lu Guang, a U.S. green card holder, was detained in Xinjiang last month &amp; hasn’t been heard from since. Chinese govt. targets journalists, denies its people basic freedoms, and violates the rights of millions in Xinjiang. #ExpressionNOToppression https://t.co/OtyRzH0ALP More photos here --&gt; https://t.co/sBu0O66kCM I am proud of the thousands of men and women who marched for the right to life for all humans today. I’m glad my office could provide hot chocolate for hundreds of #Floridians who made their way up here for this important event. #MarchforLife https://t.co/4ztw0euZN6 Among those killed in the terror attack in #Syria was Army Chief Warrant Officer Two Jonathan Farmer of Palm Beach Gardens, #Florida. He was a 37 year old married father of four who served on four overseas combat tours. May God grant his heroic soul eternal rest. https://t.co/DYXVCpwQug Insté al secretario @stevenmnuchin1 a usar todas las herramientas disponibles para evitar que la narco-tiranía de #Maduro saquee más activos en el exterior. EE.UU. debe apoyar a la democraticamente electa @AsambleaVE. https://t.co/nJ9k0QhmT0 Urged Secretary @stevenmnuchin1 to use all available tools to prevent Maduro's narcoterrorist tyranny from further pillaging assets abroad. The U.S. must support the legitimate, democratically-elected @AsambleaVE. https://t.co/nJ9k0PZLuq Great news for @TECtwwi! @FEMA announced over $1.5 million to #Quincy, for #HurricaneIrma power restoration efforts. I welcome all the men and women who came to our nation’s capital today to march for those who cannot and will never have their voices heard. #MarchforLife https://t.co/swGWzlKGns .@Enes_Kanter has a powerful message, and he’s using his platform to stand up for human rights in #Turkey. It was an honor to meet with him earlier this week. Thank you @BretBaier for covering this important story. 
 
Watch here --&gt; https://t.co/rZTJJaA2tm Joined Senator @TimKaine and other Senate colleagues in re-introducing a bi-partisan bill to prevent any U.S. president from leaving @NATO.   
https://t.co/dPp2h1LKaG Mi comentario tras la entrevista del dictador venezolano a medios de comunicación de EE.UU: https://t.co/bGIJK1VzkC My statement following Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro’s interview with U.S. press: https://t.co/NMdWrgShTh Our veterans didn't hesitate to answer the call to protect our great nation &amp; we must make sure they have the skills &amp; opportunities to successfully transition into the 21st century workforce. @SenAmyKlobuchar &amp; I introduced a bill to help them do that. https://t.co/I8nVOJGi9L Hablé con @univision23 sobre la importancia de reconocer a @jguaido como presidente provisional de #Venezuela y sobre el abuso del régimen cubano a médicos en el programa #MaisMedicos.

https://t.co/4kpTogUSxK Universities across the US are wisely severing ties w/Chinese government run Confucius Institutes. @UMassBoston is the latest. Will any remaining Confucius Institutes hold events in June to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests, or will censorship prevail? Agradecido que @MarioDB y @RepDarrenSoto introdujeron hoy una ley de TPS para Venezuela. En diciembre, introduje una legislación similar con @SenatorMenendez para apoyar a los venezolanos que temen regresar a la narco tiranía de Maduro. Grateful @MarioDB and @RepDarrenSoto have introduced the Venezuela TPS Act. In December, I introduced similar legislation with @SenatorMenendez to support Venezuelans who fear returning to Maduro’s narcoterrorist tyranny. Proud to have re-introduced my Uyghur Human Rights bill today with @SenatorMenendez and other colleagues. The U.S. must continue to shine light on China’s continued violation of human rights against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. https://t.co/CYSaAJYddx Congrats to @BGCCitrusCounty on receiving a grant by @usEDgov to continue your important work mentoring youth in #CitrusCounty

https://t.co/RJFVPRDz2V Horrible reports of new round of targeting against LGBT people in Chechnya under ruthless leader Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2017, I spoke on the Senate floor about this. Responsible nations should put a spotlight on the ongoing human rights abuses in Chechnya &amp; demand accountability. https://t.co/DWn5IhKgYQ RT @SmallBizCmte: WATCH: Chairman @marcorubio names Indian Pass Raw Bar of #PortStJoe in #GulfCounty, #Florida as the #SmallBusinessoftheWe… RT @marcorubio: It was an honor to meet with @Enes_Kanter yesterday.

There's a growing consensus Congress must take action to address consumer data privacy. That is why I introduced the American Data Dissemination Act to protect small businesses &amp; startups while ensuring consumers still have much-needed rights &amp; protections.https://t.co/GfoUlWCgFG Congrats to @UF for being named one of the top five online bachelor programs in the nation! #sayfie

Watch here: https://t.co/OcwmqaoMcl 5 yrs ago Chinese authorities detained Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti &amp; sentenced him to life in prison. Today #China maintains a vast network of “political reeducation” camps targeting Uyghur Muslims for internment while lobbying other countries not to criticize their rights abuses. https://t.co/nGKLwg3zJr
