For those celebrating, check out some of the events in our community! https://t.co/aG4LALzGdr The #TrumpShutdown means hundreds of thousands of public servants—including FBI agents, DEA agents, border patrol agents and customs officers, and Secret Service agents—are working without pay. https://t.co/K2ob5l3gWl .@RepSandyLevin has been a champion for Michigan’s families—fighting for fair trade deals, high-wage jobs and affordable health care. I’ll miss him next year in Congress, but I’m glad he plans to stay involved helping provide more opportunity to others. https://t.co/SOhb56sPsU RT @RepMcGovern: I just tried to bring up a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen the government, but the @HouseGOP wouldnt even recogniz… A New Democratic majority is ready to end the #TrumpShutdown that is hurting the American economy and costing millions of dollars. https://t.co/4MVZYEZ2si Merry Christmas and happy holidays to those in Michigan and around the world! Wishing everyone a joyful day spent with loved ones. https://t.co/CT2OaVE3K6 💯 https://t.co/K9DGVbagsT During the shutdown, my office is still here to help. If you need help with a federal agency, Social Security, Medicare or veterans’ benefits, you can reach out online at https://t.co/0rIZMS1sgZ or at 810-238-8627. Shutting down the government hurts our economy and the 800,000 federal employees who will go without pay for the holidays. I voted against adjourning Congress—we must work to pass a budget that protects our national security and keeps the government open. https://t.co/W8UeEc1JVX Every American should take a minute to read General Mattis’ resignation letter. https://t.co/FxjhDSHV2Y I’m proud to support the #FirstStepAct, which provides critical revisions to the federal criminal justice system. This bill is the positive step we need to address the nation’s over-incarceration problem &amp; to promote public safety for all Americans. https://t.co/HHy2xfyL86 Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. If the government shuts down, make no mistake—this will be the Trump shutdown. This is no way to run the corner grocery store, let alone the government of the United States. https://t.co/A82XP1cR74 Congrats, @HurleyMedical! I’m grateful every day for the work you do taking care of our children. #FlintFWD https://t.co/KD55gdO03A Jacky was a good friend of mine. I’ll miss his kindness and commitment to improving the lives of Flint kids. He was a friend to many and our entire community will miss him. https://t.co/ZIAWjXc6O9 Relieved to see a federal judge strike down President Trump’s cruel immigration policy. I previously urged the @TheJusticeDept to protect asylum seekers fleeing domestic and gang violence. https://t.co/CxBp8498OT Great news for Flint! Proud to work with @HUDgov and @KarenAboutFlint to protect Flint kids from the dangers of lead-based paint. https://t.co/VRvCQfAxK5 A new Democratic majority will work to pass common sense gun safety measures like background checks that will help protect Michigan families. https://t.co/HwmXwRLfGr RT @MichiganAdvance: Congressman @dankildee (D-Flint) today announced a $2.2M grant from from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Deve… .@RealDonaldTrump has made promises he has not kept. Instead of helping boost U.S. manufacturing, the President's economic policies have overwhelmingly benefited the biggest corporations and richest Americans.

Read my op-ed in today's @USAToday: https://t.co/z92egiNj33 The culture of corruption at the @Interior Department under Ryan Zinke was a disgrace. We need leaders who will protect our public lands and will protect our environment. https://t.co/07pC6zUFEC Proud to partner with @RepJackBergman to fight for resources to help identify #PFAS contamination sites in Michigan and across the country. https://t.co/0PXbigeTgM No family should ever live through this horror. The Trump Administration’s cruel immigration policies are immoral. We need real, comprehensive immigration reform so a tragedy like this never happens again. https://t.co/1HTOZokE9m One year ago today, the FCC voted to gut #NetNeutrality. An open internet is vital to small businesses and ensuring all communities have a voice. Congress has the power to act. https://t.co/3svafFxW58 Happy Birthday, Rep. @DonaldNorcross! Glad we can work together to raise wages for hardworking families. Trump’s Dirty Water Rule puts the Great Lakes and our health at risk. What President Trump is doing is extreme and irresponsible. Our economy relies on healthy lakes and rivers and we should be protecting them from pollution. https://t.co/aXDS4x7ZFb .@RepRaskin, Happy Birthday! Looking forward to your leadership as our new Caucus Leadership Representative for @HouseDemocrats. This 11th hour power grab is a shameful attempt by Michigan Republicans to shut out Michigan voters from the democratic process. https://t.co/vJlssmYmzk Happy Birthday, @RepAnnaEshoo! Grateful for your work expanding access to affordable housing in our country. Proud to work with @RepJackBergman to identify toxic #PFAS contamination in Michigan and across the country. Our new bill is an important step in making sure governments have the resources they need to clean up these chemicals. https://t.co/Txlgz6orVJ Don Krzysiak spent his entire life making mid-Michigan a great place to live. He welcomed me and so many others to the Bay City community. I honored Don on the floor of the House of Representatives to recognize his tremendous life. https://t.co/sMfvhyaRFT Today is the 3rd anniversary of the #ParisAgreement. By pulling out of the agreement, the President has undermined critical environmental safeguards and threatened the overall health and safety of our communities. We must #ActOnClimate to ensure our kids have a healthy future. https://t.co/h9pt4bycU2 Great to see the Farm Bill pass the House, a bipartisan bill that:
✔includes my legislation to expand Double Up Food Bucks
✔preserves #SNAP
✔supports America’s farmers
✔protects jobs in Michigan agriculture
https://t.co/EMR2O31trL Congratulations Rep. @FrankPallone on becoming Chairman of the @EnergyCommerce Committee! Grateful for your work to protect our environment, address climate change, restore #NetNeutrality and lower health care costs. I have the honor &amp; privilege of serving with @RepMaxineWaters on @FSCDems and have witnessed her strong leadership fighting for the American people. Congratulations on being nominated as Chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee! .@HouseDemocrats will start the new Congress by passing legislation to clean up government and expand voting rights. We need campaign finance reform and need to ensure that every American has a voice in our democracy. https://t.co/DaUa3ETJvV Rep. @NitaLowey is a steadfast champion for middle-class families and I know she will continue to get things done for the American people as the Chairwoman of @AppropsDems. https://t.co/ZGF2AlUSLH Republicans control the House, Senate and the White House. A #TrumpShutdown would cost our economy millions of dollars and hurt American families right before the holidays. https://t.co/HNymADx6Or Congratulations @RepRichardNeal on being nominated as Chairman of the @WaysMeansCmte! Looking forward to having you lead @HouseDemocrats in our work to lower health care costs and negotiate fair trade agreements. RT @AmericaNewsroom: WATCH: @BillHemmer @RepDanKildee discussed top Democrats predicting legal peril for Trump after the Cohen sentencing f… The American taxpayer didn't rescue General Motors to save Mexican jobs. We did it to support the millions of American families with jobs tied to the auto industry.

Companies should be investing in the American worker and supporting our hardworking families. https://t.co/cXFgsW5ouR By repealing public health standards and allowing companies to pollute our water, the Trump Administration is putting Michigan families at risk. https://t.co/9rC3cSIwMN
