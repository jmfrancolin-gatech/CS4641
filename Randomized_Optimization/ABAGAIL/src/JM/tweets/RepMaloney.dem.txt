Freezing temps are extremely dangerous for our city’s homeless pop. If you see someone in need of help plz call 311 &amp; ask for Homeless Outreach to let the City know that there is a person in need of emergency shelter. https://t.co/leLEYWnPwI It is shameful that this disgusting ban is being allowed to stand. Our gov't's baseless renunciation of transgender Americans is discrimination, plain and simple, against the one group even our Admin should have enough scruples not to go after: our TROOPS. https://t.co/UUpogugI0a @wendywerner3 Im working every day to end the #TrumpShutdown. Weve passed multiple bipartisan bills in the House to open the gov but McConnell is ignoring the Constitution &amp; will only bring a vote on bills that Trump supports. So much for sep of powers.

It's not religion or religious education that we're upset with. It's the fact that the school where the Second Lady will be teaching at discriminates against the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/VsbEEWAtdT This anti-immigrant Administration’s mission to disenfranchise immigrants, their families, &amp; their communities through the #2020census is a clear attack on the rule of law &amp; our democracy.

https://t.co/JrALs0m9xb The unending list of question's for Trump's 'fixer' gets longer by the day. Feb 7 should be very interesting. https://t.co/6rT8HrrZmS The Trump Admin wants to undercount immigrant communities in the #2020Census to take power away from immigrant-friendly states &amp; cities.
