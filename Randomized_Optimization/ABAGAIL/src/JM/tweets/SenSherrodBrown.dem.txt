We have too much ill-will, too much hatred, too much bitterness, too much anger.” - @JohnDingell Our hearts are breaking for @RepDebDingell and all those who knew and loved @JohnDingell. He was an institution. And because my own words can’t do justice to John’s life and legacy, I’d like to share some of his instead: To put it quite simply: Prescription drug prices are too high. It’s past time Washington did something about it. Teamed up with @gillibrandny to reintroduce the Stop Price Gouging Act, which would protect Americans from prescription drug price spikes by requiring drug companies to report and justify their decisions to increase prices, and prevent Big Pharma from price gouging. The next step in lowering prices for all Americans is going after the corporations that engage in price gouging – increasing prices exponentially, without cause. That’s where the Stop Price Gouging Act comes in. https://t.co/Y9kMQO5R9b Under our plan, if drug companies refuse to negotiate in good faith, the Secretary could facilitate the creation of a generic drug, bringing down prices for everyone. https://t.co/liShJ4KaAB The first is a plan experts say “terrifies Big Pharma.” The Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act would allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices. The purpose of medicine is to help people, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. That’s why I’m proud to introduce two bills today to lower prescription drug prices for American families – here’s how they’ll work: WATCH LIVE: Sherrod and @RepLloydDoggett unveil their new legislation to lower prescription drug prices. https://t.co/YSMKDfZi2R https://t.co/zvp5Wzm5tu Eric Murphy defended the Trump Administration’s Muslim Ban in two separate cases, joining multi-state briefs in support of the policy. https://t.co/rgzAEqCDSm Chad Readler has argued in federal court that DACA is unlawful.

No one who has already tried to influence the Mueller investigation can be impartial – and the United States needs an impartial Attorney General. The Senate Judiciary Committee must oppose William Barr’s nomination today. Eliminating these common sense protections will result in millions of hardworking families trapped in a cycle of debt and poverty. The @CFPB is helping payday lenders rob families of their hard-earned money. -SB https://t.co/qxd6IqhOZX MUST-READ: @JimObergefell’s op-ed, arguing against Eric Murphy’s confirmation. “…if Murphy had been successful, John and I, and tens of thousands of couples like us, would have been denied the right to marry and forced to live as second-class citizens.” https://t.co/0kovuigCRc Eric Murphy led the Obergefell case for the State of Ohio, arguing that gay couples do not have a constitutionally-protected right to marry.

I don’t measure the economy by the stock market. I measure it by people’s paychecks, the cost of healthcare, housing, &amp; education. And for far too many people, hard work isn’t paying off like it should. -SB 

#SOTU https://t.co/99SBqQxhuR For too many people, hard work isn’t paying off like it should.

The day after he signed the brief, Trump nominated him to Sixth Circuit. https://t.co/iebfCzpnmg This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will take up the nominations of Chad Readler and Eric Murphy to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. These two men have spent their careers working to strip Ohioans of their healthcare rights. 

Here’s what you need to know → We need to get our priorities straight, and immediately pass our bipartisan legislation to backpay federal contract workers. These workers and their families should not suffer the consequences of a shutdown that they did not cause. https://t.co/6QJWJasMIF Right now, Republican senators are trying to repeal the estate tax – the next step in their quest to make the rich richer.
 
There is no world in which the Senate should act on that before we ensure every federal contract worker receives backpay after 35 days of lost wages. For too many workers, hard work just doesn’t pay off. If we truly value a hard day’s work, we must fix that. We can start by keeping our promise to my friend Rita Lewis &amp; to thousands of Ohioans that they can retire with the pensions they earned. Glad Rita will join me at #SOTU. https://t.co/WLgaBok1hk Because of GM’s corporate greed, thousands of workers across the country will be out of a job tomorrow.

Too often Congress and the White House have put Wall Street ahead of working people, and we cannot let that happen when it comes to the stability of our housing market. I will fight to ensure that any efforts to reform the housing market start by addressing the affordability crisis that is hurting too many renters and homeowners across this country. https://t.co/mgjXhZKyoW Instead of giving money to corporations and hoping it trickles down, let’s cut out the middle-man and put the money directly in the pockets of working families.

Eric Murphy defended Ohio’s voter purge, along with strict voter ID laws, and fought to uphold restrictions on early voting in Ohio. He led the legal battle to outlaw “Golden Week” in Ohio, which allowed voters the opportunity to register and vote on the same day. As the State Solicitor of Ohio, Eric Murphy argued against marriage equality in the landmark Obergefell case. Murphy submitted a brief to SCOTUS in which he said that a finding of a constitutional right to marriage equality would be “disruptive” to our constitutional democracy. Chad Readler also supported the Trump Administration’s discriminatory transgender military ban, and defended their heartless policy of separating families at the border. At @TheJusticeDept, Chad Readler signed a legal brief in support of a lawsuit by the state of Texas seeking to overturn pre-existing condition protections in the Affordable Care Act. The day after he signed the brief, he was nominated to the Sixth Circuit. https://t.co/iebfCzpnmg This month, President Trump re-nominated two judges to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals – Chad Readler and Eric Murphy.
 
Here’s why we can’t allow either nominee to sit on the bench → On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we memorialize the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and pay tribute to the millions who were murdered.

The tax bill should have been an opportunity to put more money in the pockets of working families – but instead: “A year later, economic data shows that the tax bill’s benefit to workers was largely a mirage.”
 
No kidding. https://t.co/bRhdwj1iTe Earlier this month, a partisan judge in Texas handed down a ruling that threatens to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. 

Now it’s up to us to work together to protect the law and all the people who depend on it. So please, share your stories and make your voices heard. https://t.co/OGzWRMQPHb These 15,000 Dayton area workers help support Wright-Patterson’s national defense efforts, and they deserve to have their wages keep up with the cost of living. -SB It’s no surprise that after handing out more than $1 trillion in tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent, President Trump is now proposing to pay for the hole he blew in the deficit by denying federal workers their pay increase. Our billionaire President is denying these workers the cost of living increase they have earned. https://t.co/rCgQ6IZT3I No mother-to-be should go without the care she needs. This bill will allow us to target maternity care resources where they’re most needed, and help ensure healthier pregnancies, healthier mothers, and healthier babies. -SB https://t.co/hyH9BT7usY Healthcare is under attack again following a Texas court case. Here’s what you need to know as we fight back. https://t.co/OGzWRMQPHb We have a lot of work ahead of us in the new year. Proud to work with @senrobportman to deliver for Ohio. https://t.co/q76kTTPFcM Last week, President Trump signed the bipartisan Farm Bill into law. Proud that this bipartisan bill will provide Ohio farmers with the certainty they deserve. https://t.co/WKy6ilwxnD We must do more to protect Ohioans from the most heinous of crimes and to provide justice, restitution, and healing for trafficking survivors – and this bill is an important step. https://t.co/eAheXCwJBB Wishing a very Merry Christmas to all those celebrating today. And to our servicemembers celebrating at home or overseas – thank you for your service. Looking for a road trip soundtrack or in-flight entertainment this holiday season? Why not catch up on this year’s episodes of Canarycast? https://t.co/c52hEMzh4m We will continue pushing GM to do the right thing, provide answers to its workers, and bring another vehicle to Lordstown to ensure workers keep their jobs. While @senrobportman and I asked GM to provide clarity to the Lordstown community, the company chose to sidestep our questions instead. As we head into the holiday season, workers at Lordstown are faced with fear and uncertainty about their futures. 

They deserve better. https://t.co/LzoAuTZQfL Everyone should read Secretary Mattis’ letter and be alarmed   https://t.co/WN218GhUKI Spent this morning with scientists at @NASAglenn, who work hard every day to develop science and technology for our country. They’re just a few of the thousands of Ohioans who would be hurt by President Trump’s temper tantrum-fueled shutdown. https://t.co/a4YZzDU1sF POTUS says he wants border security yet he’s forcing border agents to work without pay over the holidays, he’s harming farmers who need FSA offices &amp; food banks that rely on USDA over the holidays, &amp; he’s hurting working Americans who expect elected leaders to do their jobs. -SB While the Senate did its job and unanimously passed a bill to keep the government open, President Trump instead chose to throw a temper tantrum. RT @AlzCleveland: TY @RepMarciaFudge , @RepDaveJoyce , @SenSherrodBrown and @senrobportman for supporting #BOLDAlzheimersAct which now awai… On his 50 years of federal service, James said it was “a pleasure to come to work and enjoy working with people that I like.” 

That joy is an essential part of the dignity of work. Congratulations to James on this milestone. https://t.co/Azkls0Wr79 If President Trump really wants to save taxpayer money, he should roll back the giveaways to Wall Street and millionaires in his tax law. -SB It’s despicable that President Trump would pull the rug out from under hungry Americans right before the holidays – even after Congress made clear in the Farm Bill that these families shouldn’t be forced to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops to put food on the table. https://t.co/902nxyp6S2 And while Mr. Rudy let us know that my shoes were ultimately not worth As for everyone, they did at least guarantee Schuler’s donuts for the class. Paige, thanks for writing me – happy holidays! -SB Matthew Rudy, a teacher at @scsdoh, posed an...interesting challenge to his AP Government class this year: if he saw me wear a pair of UGG boots, he’d give everyone an A for the quarter.
 
When his student Paige wrote in and asked if I’d oblige, I had to respond. https://t.co/Sn21SLCfVv Terrible news. As we learn more, our thoughts go out to this officer’s loved ones. https://t.co/Su5NXCfP3p Wishing my friend @senrobportman a very happy birthday. Here’s to another year of fighting together for Ohio. -SB https://t.co/8Uwft9d9gy WATCH LIVE: Sherrod honors @RepMarciaFudge on the Senate floor for her 10 years of service. https://t.co/vyKKqb34CE Proud that the Senate passed the #FirstStepAct tonight – but as the name suggests, this is just a first step. Now we need to keep working to fix the inequities in our criminal justice system. As a political appointee at @TheJusticeDept, Chad Readler signed a legal brief used in this case, in which he challenged the Affordable Care Act’s protections for pre-existing conditions. 

3 career attorneys refused to sign that same brief – read more → https://t.co/iebfCzpnmg On Friday, a partisan judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, threatening the healthcare of millions of Americans. At the center of this lawsuit is Chad Readler, one of President Trump’s nominees to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Proud to write this joint op-ed for @FoxBusiness with @senrobportman. Together, we’re calling on GM to stand by Ohio, and its world-class workers in Lordstown.
https://t.co/BpFEL7GLqA Local news matters. #ThankAJournalist
https://t.co/fwKAdpgBgp A lot more interesting than some senator’s haircut? The story of the man who cuts it. 

Meet Carlo Sarti, and learn about the joy he takes in his work. -SB https://t.co/UI90S4fGEC A big day for the Gem City: it’s the anniversary of Dayton’s own Wright Brothers’ first flight, and our bill with @RepMikeTurner and @senrobportman to rename the courthouse after Judge Walter Rice been officially signed into law. Spoke to @TheRevAl this weekend about the criminal justice reform bill the Senate’s considering this week. It’s called the First Step Act because it's only a first step – and there is still a lot more work to be done to fix the inequities in our justice system. https://t.co/JW3c04bCEP How would this affect you? Share your story here → https://t.co/TwOfGxJY1r Republicans have tried to take away your health insurance before – but they failed because you spoke out and shared your story. We’ve fought back before and we’ll do it again. Small business tax credits? 

Gone. A requirement for insurance companies to cover essential benefits like hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, and prescription drugs? 

Gone. Rules to hold insurance companies accountable, and to make sure they treat you fairly? 

Gone. A ban on annual and lifetime limits for how much your insurance company will cover you? 

Gone. A limit on how much you’ll pay out-of-pocket each year? 

Gone. A ban on being charged more for insurance because you’re a woman? 

Gone. Contraception with no out-of-pocket cost? 

Gone. Free early-detection cancer screenings and more affordable prescription drugs for seniors through Medicare coverage? 

Gone. Free annual check-ups with your doctor? 

Gone. Medicaid expansion – including in Ohio, where it’s enabled more than 200,000 Ohioans struggling with mental illness or addiction to get the treatment they need? 

Gone. The ability to stay on your parents’ health insurance until you’re 26? 

Gone. Protections for more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions – anything from acne to pregnancy? 

Gone. Tax credits to help you afford health insurance? 

Gone. Health coverage for more than 20 million people who’ve gotten covered under the Affordable Care Act? 

Gone. Last Friday, a partisan judge in Texas handed down a ruling that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act. 

Let’s be very clear about what’s at stake if this dangerous decision is upheld – and why it’s so important that we fight back →
