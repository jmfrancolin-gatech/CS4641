I was up early this morning to talk about the outrageous and disastrous "Green New Deal" and Democrats' shift on border security with @FoxFriendsFirst #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/0s2PR2Hosl Glad to see President Trump is looking to ban Chinese telecom equipment in the US. We can’t do enough to stop Chinese espionage from occurring on our watch. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/6fWqiVJ7Jr https://t.co/nBImkHSSVc Great to join @HeatherChilders this morning. https://t.co/ATX48MMEcN Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt Hoosier families, workers, and small business owners. I asked experts today about the real-life economic consequences of raising the minimum wage to $15. https://t.co/XhGgaRGbrc “This environment really enriches the lives of both the veterans &amp; the remarkable caregivers who accept these veterans into their homes.” Heartwarming piece on how communities &amp; families in my home state of Indiana have changed the lives of our #veterans.
https://t.co/f4IGlx8Yhl It's believed that "So Help Me God" was added by George Washington to, in part, remind the Nation that no public servant is more powerful than our creator. I presume that @RepJerryNadler simply misspoke &amp; thank @RepMikeJohnson for catching the omission. https://t.co/5FmiP1z6lN RT @Avik: The bill from @RepJimBanks is very strong on hospital monopolies. Congressmen definitely take account of the calls they get from… We must stop the overt &amp; evil march toward infanticide. Thank you @SteveScalise and @RepAnnWagner for your work on this bill. I hope all members of Congress - Democrat &amp; Republican - support this common sense bill reaffirming the value of human life. 
https://t.co/DYfd46dWw1 Free and fair elections are fundamental to preserving our republic and our freedoms. Dems are pushing #HR1 that will give unfair partisan advantages, allow your tax dollars to be used for campaigns and circumvent state rights in running elections. Dangerous and must be stopped! RT @EdLaborGOP: Republican Leader @virginiafoxx talks with tipped workers who would lose their jobs in a $15 fed min wage hike. Oddly, they… ISIS-K is a growing and deadly threat in Afghanistan. As the Administration considers withdrawing from the country, today I asked Pentagon officials how they plan to limit this dangerous threat to the U.S. homeland. https://t.co/HuyUEs4SOH My Hospital Competition Act of 2019 is the perfect place to start.
https://t.co/t6CMO7KEq0 A new study shows that hospital prices are increasing at a much higher rate than physician prices. We need to act now to drive down the skyrocketing cost of hospital care by allowing for greater competition. Former VA Secretaries got it right – #veterans are more than capable of choosing healthcare that best meets their needs. With community care and @VeteransHealth coexisting, veterans will have more access to the care they have earned.
https://t.co/XEH5Jnnik1 RT @IvanKorcok: A dynamic day on the Hill. Pleased to meet @RepJimBanks from #Indiana. Strong relations with #INNG and ambition to do more… My reaction to the #SOTU: https://t.co/PpJgyyyGZP Tonight's #SOTU was a home run for @POTUS. Our Nation is strong, and the agenda President Trump laid out - based on bipartisanship and cooperation - will make America more safe an prosperous country. I hope my Democratic friends join us in this process. .@POTUS take's his responsibility to keep the Nation safe, from threats both foreign and domestic, seriously.  We must protect our interests abroad and defend our allies globally.  Peace can only be achieved through strength. #SOTU .@POTUS is protecting the unborn. Look at the facts: 
✅Pro-Life Supreme Court Justices (x2) and 83 Federal District &amp; Circuit Court Judges
✅States permitted to defund Planned Parenthood of Title X funds
✅Stopped tax dollars from funding abortion overseas.
#SOTU Glad to see this Administration focus on the need for affordable, quality #healthcare and prescription drugs. We need bold proposals like my bill, the Hospital Competition Act of 2019, to lower costs for all Americans.  #SOTU
https://t.co/6AELwojImh I support free-trade, but I also support working to achieve better deals for America. I'm proud we have a President willing to call out China on unfair trade practices &amp; IP theft on the biggest stage. #SOTU With "caravans" seeking to circumvent US law, a recent 254 lb fentanyl bust at a port of entry &amp; an increase in human trafficking reports, our border crisis is undeniable. Congress must pass legislation that supports our border patrol agents &amp; funds a more fortified border. #SOTU Looking forward to the #SOTU tonight. After unnecessary delays and petty politics, let’s come together and work towards bipartisan solutions that will make our country stronger and more prosperous. @POTUS #SOTU It is alarming that the @FTC, a regulatory body in the US government, would utilize an executive from a foreign company – whose products are banned by the U.S. government due to security concerns – as a key witness in a regulatory case. My full statement: https://t.co/feMIK86ccV https://t.co/g5gSx1lOZS Great to see @SenSasse forcing debate on the Born Alive Abortion Providers Protection Act.  As a cosponsor of the companion bill in the House, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to denounce infanticide and protect babies born alive after failed abortions. https://t.co/zsaevmB2hj RT @HouseVetAffairs: Welcome @RepJimBanks, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization. https://t.co/t8DI8Uwkip To everyone fighting cancer or impacted by the fight against cancer, stay strong and remember we are with you. We all hope of one day living in a cancer free world. #WorldCancerDay Honored to continue my leadership on the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Technology Modernization as the Ranking Member. I’ll keep asking the tough questions to make sure the new electronic health record provides the capabilities veterans and VA employees actually need. https://t.co/jgrp1hdIw0 .@POTUS &amp; @SecPompeo are finally displaying the toughness and resolve toward Russia that was so badly lacking in the last administration.  Russia should have been put on notice the moment they became non-compliant during the Obama administration.  That ends today. https://t.co/3qBqfNOdzw Another great #jobsreport. Now is the time to push for more pro-growth policies, not reckless tax hikes and government spending. https://t.co/Nfeh5xXfpt Border security means physical barriers as well as enhanced technologies at ports of entry. This is a big bust, but many more shipments like this come into our country undetected. We’ve got to do more about and I call on colleagues to act now! https://t.co/2eEtI2hJrk Thank you @VP for your continued efforts in the fight for life. We must continue this fight for all Americans, born and unborn. https://t.co/WfHF64mjy6 This week we recognize and celebrate Catholic education in the United States for #CSW19. Please read my full statement here: https://t.co/Zx3J0Xfhvq The Democrats' dramatic drift to the radical left continues. Sen Sanders now wants to confiscate the life’s work of countless American businesses and family farms. This is the politics of envy, pure and simple.
https://t.co/QGE2X5eMBk Outrageous! What @GovernorVA just described is infanticide. Killing a baby outside the womb is murder. https://t.co/jeXxKiTVPF American universities need to reconsider their partnerships with Huawei. A company with so many ties to the CCP has no place on U.S. college campuses. We need to see through this disguise and limit their malicious influence on our students, faculty, and researchers. @Morning_Edu https://t.co/K3vRDaetV1 First meeting as Chairman of the Republican Study Budget and Spending Task Force was a success! The committee is looking forward to constructing a strong budget that reflects good conservative policy for the year ahead. @RepublicanStudy https://t.co/cTQDtz35wn Yet another bill is introduced that will allow abortion up until the moment of birth. This video should make every American with a conscious sick to their stomach.  We must not allow the left’s radical pro-abortion agenda to continue. https://t.co/fPnjl0d7oF Thank you to @AMGeneral_LLC and @NGAUS1878 for the opportunity to discuss the critical capabilities the #HMMWV provides to our military and allies. I'm proud of Indiana's great jobs that support the #HMMWV and the high quality products produced by Hoosiers in the 3rd district. https://t.co/Qt5HR6goDg Last month alone, 154,000 illegal migrants attempted to cross the border. After this morning’s #HASC hearing, it is clear to me that our troops are playing an important role in partnership with @DHSgov to strengthen our border and address the national security threats there. https://t.co/9eyYMWVzVC I am glad that @SenKamalaHarris is finally being honest about the Democrats plan to eliminate private health insurance and complete the government takeover of healthcare started by Obamacare.
https://t.co/ULUyoUXHhv The American people deserve to know the extent and results of these activities.
https://t.co/waFqU76o4n Director Coats is right to draw attention to these concerns. It is one of the reasons I believe the Mueller Report should be made public upon it’s release as it is primarily focused on election meddling by foreign adversaries, namely Russia. "The next 3 weeks offer a golden opportunity to do what’s right by Americans by securing our border &amp; fixing major parts of our immigration system.  Let’s not let this chance go to waste.

https://t.co/cdBoTj2aUQ Great to hear feedback from so many constituents on a lot of issues at yesterday’s town hall meeting in New Haven. 

https://t.co/GIPZaPfvDD Had a great time today on @Bloomberg's Sound On with @KevCirilli. We covered a lot of ground, from border security to Venezuela to @U2. Listen to the full interview here: https://t.co/MfoQLUgAw3 Started my week off right, chatting with constituents at my Town Hall meeting in New Haven this morning.  Thanks to everyone who came out and took part in the conversation! https://t.co/bp0EGUMtH7 Preventing another shutdown in 3 weeks is at risk due to the poor leadership of @SpeakerPelosi.  It's time for the Speaker to stop putting politics over country and invite @realDonaldTrump to deliver his overdue #SOTU asap.  #DoYourJob “The biggest issue we face at the moment, the biggest question mark is whether or not for $16.1+ billion we will be able to buy interoperability with community providers. If we don’t get that, this process is going to be a failure.” https://t.co/VHzSPINCc6 74 years ago today the last prisoners of Auschwitz were released. Let us never forget the victims of the Holocaust. I encourage our friends in Europe to continue working with @WJRORestitution to bring justice to the remaining survivors. #HolocaustRemembranceDay Thank you to all those who chose life today in the Allen County Right to Life March. We continue to fight for the dignity and protection of the unborn, a cause I will keep being an advocate for in Indiana and at our Nation’s Capital. #prolifegeneration https://t.co/hwTqGO3whS My Hospital Competition Act of 2019 is the only serious effort in Congress to combat this startling trend and overall reduce health care costs for most American families. https://t.co/fTB0S6bd8a Looking forward to joining the Fort Wayne March for Life and walking alongside men, women and children defending the right to life for the unborn. We march for those who don’t have a voice in their own life’s destiny. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/E7CU3gwKTK Great to meet with student veterans, Sarah and Esteban, and learn about @IUBloomington and @IUvetserv’s partnership with our military and veteran community. https://t.co/AYOLC7vpqh The @FTC’s dependence on testimony from Huawei in its case against Qualcomm unfortunately serves more to legitimize this insidious, state-run entity and undermines our regulatory system. https://t.co/kyZyig6g2z RT @WOWOpatmiller: .@RepJimBanks joins in studio to discuss the Covington boys, the State of the Union, the shutdown,  border security and… Incredibly sad. I have a feeling none of these state legislators understand what actually happens during an abortion at late stages of pregnancy. All who believe life is sacred should be outraged. https://t.co/y4Nj1wpHst Those of us who believe in free markets need to confront the skyrocketing cost of health care being driven by consolidation. My Hospital Competition Act of 2019 would do just that. As @Avik notes today, support for single payer health care will continue to rise if nothing is done to introduce market competition in health care and the hospital sector:
https://t.co/y6ioac5dpY Our Nation’s veterans deserve the best from their government. These commonsense measures to increase VA Oversight and Honor Deceased Veterans will help better serve veterans across Indiana and the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support their passage.  https://t.co/SrASlThVVr I am pleased to see that @realDonaldTrump has officially recognized National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the Interim President of Venezuela. I fully support the Venezuelan peoples' fight to overthrow the tyrannical regime of Nicolás Maduro.    
https://t.co/ghCzuFHyUA .@SpeakerPelosi's petty obstruction knows no bounds. @POTUS ought to uphold tradition &amp; deliver his #SOTU in front of Congress. Last week, I wrote to @VP requesting he &amp; @senatemajldr invite the President to deliver his speech in the Senate Chamber, if the House is not an option. https://t.co/cbOg478r4f I struggle to understand how it can be legal in America to extinguish an innocent heartbeat.  Tragic and unconscionable. https://t.co/DFNwhuK6KK Encouraging to see decreased wait times for our nation’s veterans at the @DeptVetAffairs. Looking forward to building on the progress of last Congress to make these wait times consistently lower around the country. https://t.co/UBtTbSOSdx Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his incredible sacrifice and advocacy for equal rights and justice.  May we all strive to live up to his example. (Picture: The MLK Memorial Bridge in Ft. Wayne) https://t.co/nu2hWiwiRa .@realDonaldTrump’s speech was an example of the leadership Americans are demanding, and demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and compromise. It’s time for @SpeakerPelosi to stop the games, and join the President at the negotiating table. Indiana’s economy remains strong thanks to pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that have come out of Washington and Indianapolis.  Republican economic reforms work, and Hoosiers are benefiting. https://t.co/MpIP5oAwxD “Every child is a sacred gift from God.” I applaud President Trump for taking a bold stand for life and protections for unborn children. Not one cent of taxpayer money should fund abortions at home or internationally. Life is nonnegotiable.

Instead of giving @realDonaldTrump a national audience to speak to, she'd rather spoil an  American tradition. It's time to grow up, do your job, and negotiate. Here we go again ... on #ReligiousFreedomDay of all days, the left’s vitriol against Christians and attacks on Karen Pence are disgraceful and unwarranted. https://t.co/T5wlRYWPwq Please keep the families and loved ones of the U.S. service members lost today in your prayers.

With threats rising from ISIS-K and other terrorist groups, America’s presence in Afghanistan today is as important as it has ever been to protect the homeland and our allies. While we all want an end to America’s longest running war, it must be done the right way. Withdrawing half our troops from Afghanistan at this critical time is a major risk that would lead to greater instability and jeopardize America’s national security.

James Gfrerer and Tamara Bonzanto are excellent nominees for CIO and Accountability &amp; Whistleblower Protection.

My legislation includes reforms that would reduce the cost of hospital care. Read more: https://t.co/FJtMkUqh3V For most Hoosier families, health care expenses continue to rise, and a major reason why is hospital costs. In 2016, Americans spent $1.1 trillion on hospital care, which amounted to nearly a third of every dollar spent on health care in the United States. https://t.co/FJtMkUqh3V Great read on the “most innovative university president in America.” We’re fortunate to have @purduemitch leading the way on college affordability. https://t.co/GqraeR0mVZ RT @93wibc: NEWS: Banks Calls Trump's Demand For Border Wall Funding A "Reasonable Request" | 93.1 WIBC https://t.co/LsYZXiWzs2 https://t.c… That being said, Obamacare did not create all of the problems in our health care system, and Congress should work together on bipartisan solutions to make health care more affordable. Here’s one I have introduced: https://t.co/ghYUP9gr63 While this is only a step in the right direction, it is good news. I will keep fighting to replace Obamacare with pro-market reforms that empower patients, lower premiums and increase access. https://t.co/PRipQzpJs5 Congrats to @MickMulvaneyOMB and @RussVought45 on their new roles. Both are smart and talented professionals who understand how Capitol Hill works. They will serve @realDonaldTrump well and advance conservative principles. Very concerning to see the #PRC exploit our defense industrial base. I agree with our #USNavy Secretary: “We must act decisively to fully understand both the nature of these attacks and how to prevent further loss of vital military information.”  https://t.co/9LsOPncXG1 Joining @HughHewitt at 6:30 AM to discuss how the Administration’s new WOTUS rule is a win for farmers and landowners.

I strongly support Bangladesh’s efforts to combat radical Islamist groups and affirm the rights of religious minorities. https://t.co/1Avu7di6zs Thank you @HudsonInstitute for the opportunity to speak about democracy in Bangladesh and my resolution that expresses concern about the threat posed by radical groups operating in Bangladesh. You can watch my remarks here: https://t.co/Gy7IQV7Cf7 https://t.co/iX0i6jpVWR Last week, jobless claims decreased faster than at any point since April 2015. This is another sign of the strong economy made possible by pro-growth policies.

Thank you for being "Always Ready, Always There" to defend our homeland. https://t.co/h2traTFoFJ Good news - FCC Adams is investing $24 million to expand operations and create more Hoosier jobs in northeast Indiana. https://t.co/4MZwywtSg2 As we await more details, we are thinking and praying for the Richmond community. https://t.co/kJLGkvypKB I have fought for months to permanently repeal the Obama-era WOTUS rule, and I applaud the Administration’s announcement of a new WOTUS rule that would end the uncertainty currently faced by Hoosier farmers and landowners. https://t.co/sPCsBIkp21 Overlooking Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou’s criminal activities would show our adversaries that they can break our laws in exchange for better trade negotiations. Evading U.S. sanctions on Iran should not merit a “get out of jail free” pass. https://t.co/gaEjjRLfwt Nice story about how Indianapolis is becoming a tech hub. Balanced budgets, limited regulations and low taxes make Indiana an attractive business destination. https://t.co/yPBCIJH0EE The Pentagon has saved $4.3 billion over the past year. Congrats to Hoosier Lisa Hershman, acting chief management officer at DOD, on enacting sweeping reforms. DOD is adapting technologically to save taxpayer dollars and defeat our adversaries. https://t.co/F3F2wDY1Ew Remember this comment the next time liberals accuse President Trump of dividing the country. @SenSchumer thinks Indiana doesn’t matter. https://t.co/YsAX5tAUKc Navy Secretary: Proposed USS Fort Wayne ‘will receive every consideration’ https://t.co/y3oq1pV6md via @newssentinel RT @AIPAC: Happy 202nd birthday Indiana! #Israelinmystate https://t.co/Qx9kBvOlEg I have fought to eliminate the misguided medical device tax since taking office, and I strongly support an additional five-year suspension.

Come visit Team Banks in our new office in 1713 Longworth. https://t.co/5bKIa7274G It was an honor to speak at @NGAUS1878 Industry Day today at the National Guard Memorial. Thank you to our Guard members and industry partners for your commitment to our national defense. https://t.co/V4rNJNKN7g RT @NGAUS1878: Thank you Hon. Jim Banks, IN-R for speaking with us today at the National Guard Memorial. https://t.co/mYGIg4ueR5 Happy 202nd birthday to the greatest state in the union. On this day in 1816, President James Madison approved Indiana's admission as our 19th state. #Hoosiers Pro-growth policies have produced an economy with record levels of available jobs. According to the most recent Labor Department report, there are one million more jobs than unemployed workers. https://t.co/4ohU4WFpcj Great to see that @RuralSourcing will be adding 130 jobs in Fort Wayne. Another sign of the strong economy benefiting Hoosiers in #IN03.
https://t.co/PsF6uMbyQ5 Almost time for the best football game of the year #GoNavy #BeatArmy Today’s global picture is as complicated as ever, and we need the right leaders in place to confront these challenges. General Milley has done a fantastic job as Army Chief of Staff and will serve @POTUS well in this new role. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I’ve questioned General Milley and listened to him address difficult topics. He is tough, candid and exactly what @POTUS needs in our nation’s top military adviser. We thank General Dunford for his incredible service to our country. https://t.co/iB0fPxXFeF
