There are several provisions in this that ensure there’s no executive overreach, including: 3-year sunset provision, require consultation w/ Congress 45 days prior to actions, publishing proposed actions for Public Comment. The goal of this legislation is not to raise tariffs for their own sake. On the contrary, if @POTUS has the tools needed to bring other nations to the negotiating table, they will lower their tariffs on American goods. Regarding the Reciprocal Trade Act, @WSJ ed board is wrong on this one. We’ve been losing a trade war for decades, and our workers, farmers, and manufacturers are hurting.
