Apart from God, we can do nothing (John 15:5), and making time for prayer and Christian fellowship as leaders is so important as we work to serve our nation honorably. #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/tLsYEQsXwU RT @EdLaborGOP: Republican Leader @virginiafoxx talks with tipped workers who would lose their jobs in a $15 fed min wage hike. Oddly, they… RT @GOPLeader: On February 6, 1911, President Ronald Reagan was born. He chose greatness for America, and his legacy continually reminds us… RT @GOPLeader: President Trump is right. Congress should vote to prohibit late-term abortions of children who can feel pain in their mother… Since @POTUS' election, the US economy has gained 5.3 million more jobs, unemployment continues at historic lows and wages are rising. The GOP is working with the President to continue these positive trends and foster greater opportunity for all Americans. #SOTU https://t.co/0a94t3qesl CNBC - "Job growth in January shattered expectations, with nonfarm payrolls surging by 304,000."

https://t.co/UBvY9PtXZI that considers only 1 of 2 people involved in an abortion. I’ll continue to fight for the rights of the unborn, and I pray for our culture to realize their rights are not a threat to women’s rights. All life is valuable and deserves to be protected by law, not legally devalued. And these policies lay bare the extreme agenda of the pro-abortion movement. Nothing warrants such evil and rendering the life of the unborn indefensible or permitting infanticide are no ways to ensure women’s health. These extremisms follow from a radical and callous belief... These policies systematically remove the rights of the unborn from existing law, and the NY law goes so far as to revoke healthcare for babies born after a botched abortion. They fly in the face of the limits on abortion that most Americans support. The Reproductive Health Act law being celebrated by pro-abortion activists in NY and VA’s Repeal Act bill supported by abortion advocates, pro-abortion legislators and @GovernorVA are horrifying indicators of the spreading of a culture of death in our society. Political robocalls should not be exempt from the FTC's Do Not Call List. This week, I introduced the Robo COP Act to give Americans reprieve from these unsolicited recordings and make politicians play by the same rules as everyone else. @WFMY https://t.co/P7d8Wsd7Tl On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we honor the 6 million victims of the Jewish genocide and the millions of other lives taken by the Nazis.

This shutdown was preventable, and it’s a shame that a strong border securing our nation is no longer the bipartisan priority it once was. Under Pres.

Along with my colleagues @RepSires, @RepMcCaul, and @NitaLowey, I am proud we introduced this resolution to support Israel as a fellow member state in international organizations, our strategic ally, and friend. #Israel70 https://t.co/qutbUwYbLV Joined @FLOTUS at the White House today for the launch of the #BeBest initiative. I couldn't agree more that in our rapidly changing society, "It remains our generation’s moral imperative to take responsibility and help our children manage the many issues they are facing today." https://t.co/PK6zArFN1K As we wrap up #SmallBusinessWeek, I want to thank the many small business owners that support our economy and enrich #NC05 with their talents and services. Was great to meet with so many of you at the Boone Business Expo this week! https://t.co/07Vhlhq99a On #NationalDayOfPrayer we are reminded to humbly thank God for His many blessings on our country. Today and everyday, I join Americans of all faiths in praying that God grant safety to our country's service members, wisdom to its leaders, &amp; strength in our faith communities. https://t.co/hmD9JAGWnZ Had a nice tour of the plant and meeting with the leadership team at @sustainablesock in Mt.

The #TaxCutsandJobsAct paved way to lower tax rates and a fairer tax code to help small businesses grow and create jobs. Now, according to @NFIB, small business optimism is at its highest in 30 years! https://t.co/KzCSODBAhE Since 1999, opioid-related deaths in the US have quadrupled.

Serving the people of Wisconsin has been a tremendous honor for @SpeakerRyan and he has served them well. He accepted the Speaker’s gavel and took on the burden of leadership for the good of our conference and our nation – not out of political ambition. He has a servant’s heart!

Losing 174 people a day during 2016 to this devastating crisis, is nothing short of unacceptable and heartbreaking. #SOTU
