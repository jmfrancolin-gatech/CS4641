This is a hateful action against a minority community simply because they were born somewhere else.

*Fact: Refugees grow the economy &amp; commit fewer crimes. https://t.co/Wdxm86AkJp The American people deserve to have a say in whether we continue to support the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which is creating an humanitarian disaster. But today, @HouseGOP is holding a vote to block this Congress from even debating the War Powers Act! https://t.co/NxmWMNiule I‚Äôm proud to stand with the people of Iran who are courageously striving for a free and democratic future. https://t.co/EWtVgZDi0l Makes sense. His whole business was based on putting his name on things that shutdown. https://t.co/or96qDHr91 According to US Customs and Border Protection, the majority of drugs are carried through legal ports of entry. A wall would not stop drug flow into the country and the President shouldn't hurt families &amp; our economy w/ a shutdown because of false information about border security https://t.co/fWSs8BWa4t The Clean Water Act protects streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions. But today, Trump is announcing a #DirtyWaterRule that ignores science and public support in order to enrich polluters. Halting climate change by transitioning the U.S. to a carbon-free economy is both urgent and achievable. In LA County we're already on our way, while also growing our economy. It's time to do the same thing nationally. A #GreenNewDeal will help us make a green economy a reality. Planned Parenthood exists to make sure healthcare is accessible to everyone. The Supreme Court did the right thing today by continuing to let people use Medicaid to receive essential healthcare at @PPFA. https://t.co/ehttHxciOP The "foundation of freedom, justice and peace" is the "recognition of the...equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family." This truth is too easily forgotten. 70 years ago today, Eleanor Roosevelt helped us remember w/ the Universal Declaration of Human Rights! https://t.co/4wYaZfPoLM The big point here isn't that Trump is an obvious hypocrite driven by bigotry &amp; xenophobia, but that undocumented immigrants are a part of our country &amp; our communities. They contribute, we rely on them. This war on immigrants is nonsensical and counterproductive. https://t.co/8d7IKoN0bH Thank you @SenKamalaHarris for taking us one step closer in our decades-long fight to increase access to and protection of our precious outdoor spaces like the San Gabriel Mountains.

https://t.co/Dl5Z9E3d6H Let me explain this, because you clearly don't understand economics. Immigrants:

Work -&gt; generate profits
Start businesses in greater numbers -&gt; create jobs
Pay taxes -&gt; create revenue
Start families, buy homes -&gt; grow communities

Your bigotry has never been about economics https://t.co/rasJu63LVs Trump's public charge rule puts a price on who can stay in the U.S. -  basing green card issuance on income, health, age, language, or use of public benefits.

I'm excited for what the new majority under her leadership will bring in January. https://t.co/SeZkDiYVDw The war in Yemen has created an humanitarian crisis where hundreds of thousands of children are starving. A cease fire would allow us to get needed supplies there, but Trump just rejected one for fear of upsetting Saudi Arabia! https://t.co/LUk9UgG4HO Releasing a report on Black Friday, Trump tried to hide his own administration's warnings on climate change. But hiding isn't a option for Californians.

Yes, there are differences. But it's the similarities that are most alarming. https://t.co/7mnfkaPHHG Touchdown confirmed!

It was all a nakedly political use of our military in order to influence an election. Our military deserves better. https://t.co/mnvZ4SxV0W .@NancyPelosi always stands with us, and I'm proud to stand with her. She has the progressive passion and the experience as a skilled legislator to continue to protect our healthcare, social security &amp; environment; fight for families, women and immigrants; and curb inequality. https://t.co/7rUVDoOzOK This is why we need the Voting Rights Act. It‚Äôs not a joke, it‚Äôs our own history. And it will come back if we don‚Äôt restore the VRA‚Äôs protections. #VotingRights https://t.co/gJFTFFQOua For most of our history, the only voters were men. And our policies reflected that. Women still have to fight to be able to plan our families, access health care, earn equal pay, not be harassed at work...

It's not about winning men or women. It's about fighting for equality. https://t.co/k2yEy0VLHT It should be easier to vote than to buy a gun. But Trump still opposes universal background checks while assuming you need an ID to buy breakfast cereal. What a twisted set of priorities...and understanding of basic grocery shopping. https://t.co/t2G46icPxj I have deep concerns about the war in #Yemen &amp; the humanitarian crisis it has caused. We should not be supporting this war w/out at least a debate in Congress, as the constitution requires. GOP should be letting us debate, not changing rules to block it https://t.co/IUNzEQyeFR If you planned your family by deciding when to have a second, or a third child, or none at all, according to your means &amp; desires, then join me in saying #ThanksBirthControl &amp; oppose Trump's effort to give your boss a veto over your access to this essential healthcare. Now that the election - and therefore the phony political warnings of an invading caravan - are over, it's time for Trump to stop using the military to campaign. End the deployment &amp; xenophobia. Let our troops be with their families this holiday season. https://t.co/ngRGdZI7KV Climate change puts every one of us at risk, which we see today as Californians battle bigger &amp; more frequent wildfires. So I welcome @NancyPelosi's call to reinstate the select committee to address the climate crisis, a body dedicated to solutions &amp; action. The GOP promised us that corporate tax cuts = jobs, but "...since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance." https://t.co/MMm5xYBcDQ RT @PFA809: Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong.

No matter what he thinks, Trump is not above the law. And now that the House is prepared to do its job again, he won't be able to act like he is. https://t.co/ZAMg5NBUiv The 2nd rule goes out of its way to make it harder for 1.3 million women with health insurance through the ACA to pay for an abortion. To be clear, abortion is still legal &amp; safe, but now it‚Äôs Trump &amp; not a doctor determining which women can have one. https://t.co/a4hYkv07AV 3/3 The first gives your employer a VETO over access to birth control, which is legal &amp; medically approved.

Like the 14th amendment, I believe we should prioritize people, not prejudice. The voters and Congress agreed. That can't be undone with a stroke of a pen.

There is no evidence of a threat. 

Creating fear to win elections puts lives at risk. Please stop the fear mongering, stop the xenophobia, stop the hate.

That is why it is time to end the campaign of fear and hate and to pass gun laws that prevent those inspired by hate from acting on it It‚Äôs time to stop using words like enemies in order stir up violent xenophobia. Messages of enemies make people look for enemies. And we know from our own history that that there are too many tragic examples of where that leads. Sadly, now so does another generation This was an act of hatred by a man acting alone. We will fight back with unity, a community standing together.
