My prayers are with his wife @RepDebDingell and their family at this difficult time. Tennesseans from the National @leagueofcities stopped by to discuss federal investment in local infrastructure projects, building to withstand potential natural disasters, and expanding broadband services. https://t.co/Mr6QGDPMTD Visited with a great group of Tennesseans at this evening‚Äôs American Forest &amp; Paper Association event! Always good to hear when businesses are doing well in our state. https://t.co/hir7eJQ6cn Great to speak to the HBCU Fly-In attendees today and have a representative from @thelanecollege in the group! Tennessee‚Äôs HBCUs generate an estimated $873 million in economic impact as well as 7,289 jobs. Thank you for the work you do for our young people. https://t.co/fxZ40Cn5Z6 We discussed this and more at our @SenateCommerce committee hearing this morning. It is important to ensure that we meet the needs for expanding broadband in our communities while also protecting our networks from foreign adversaries. As we look to expand broadband, we need to ensure the technology we are using is secure. We should be mindful that winning the race to 5G requires a whole of government approach and collaboration with the private sector. ‚ÄúFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn‚Äôt pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed in for them to do the same.‚Äù Happy Birthday to President Reagan! https://t.co/PNZw1KdBBG This morning, Knoxville Fire Chief D.J. Corcoran, who
accompanied me to the #SOTU and his wife, Wendy, joined me on @FoxandFriends to discuss the tragic loss of their son, Pierce, who was killed by an illegal immigrant. @Justice4Pierce #AngelFamilies https://t.co/7o1Vym8WMu My statement on tonight‚Äôs #SOTU: https://t.co/YtwMVBSY5M We‚Äôre seeing real results, and I am excited to work with both the @POTUS and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to bring about real change for the American people. In the one year since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct was passed, 51,900 jobs have come to Tennessee. Our economy is growing at unprecedented rates, with 304,000 jobs added to the economy in January. Tonight‚Äôs #SOTU will highlight the many ways our country has benefitted from the Republican policies implemented over the past two years. Another #TennesseeTuesday with @senalexander in the books! Great to meet with so many constituents on this beautiful day in Washington. https://t.co/sXJRELpKCg It is an honor to attend with them. Please join me in praying for their family and other #AngelFamilies across our country. #JusticeForPierce Tonight, Knoxville Fire Chief D.J.

Their family has experienced an unthinkable tragedy following the loss of their 22 year old son, Pierce, who was killed by an illegal immigrant in December. The Navy‚Äôs first female fighter pilot was laid to rest yesterday, and her life was celebrated with the first all-female flyover in her honor.

Stopping the flow of this drug into our country is crucial to addressing this public health crisis. Tennessee law enforcement officials tell us Fentanyl is a threat to safety on our streets and lives in our communities. It is fueling the opioid crisis. https://t.co/RH4rbsTZMp 304,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January - nearly twice the number forecasted. Our pro-growth policies are providing real results for the American people. Senator Sasse just asked the Senate to unanimously pass S. 130, a bill to stop infanticide. It is unconscionable for the Democrats to obstruct legislation that protects life. The good people of Virginia should demand the resignation of an elected official who would recommend the premeditated taking of the life of a child. It is an honor to join with @timburchett to bring DJ and Wendy Corcoran as our guests to the State of the Union. #JusticeForPierce https://t.co/gsMyRSi8En RT @Tennessean: Sen.

The deal was sold to Americans based on a pack of lies and deception. The President‚Äôs decision to withdraw was correct. https://t.co/QN3KQanmE1 Thank you @FranklinTNPD &amp; @FranklinFire for hosting a remarkable #September11th memorial tribute yesterday - Team Blackburn was happy to attend. An important moment for #TN07 law enforcement to unite with the community and remember those lost during such senseless attacks. https://t.co/WWdYonZwQZ Good to see Arizona AG @GeneralBrnovich stepping up to protect consumer #privacy. I have been pushing for privacy protections no matter where you go online. This is why we need to pass the BROWSER Act. 
 https://t.co/aSCyFlyUDu Honored to receive the "Friend of Farm Bureau Award" from the @TNFarmBureau &amp; American @FarmBureau. Farmers &amp; ranchers serve as the backbone of our communities. I remain dedicated to strengthening &amp; providing certainty for rural Tennesseans and Americans everywhere. https://t.co/XhNaZD96qy Today we honor the thousands of victims who lost their lives, their families, law enforcement officials, first responders &amp; Good Samaritans who sacrificed to save others. May we #NeverForget the strength &amp; resolve of the American people amidst the evil of terrorism #September11th https://t.co/zz1cv3mepi My heart breaks for the moms &amp; families who have lost loved ones because our government has done too little to protect this country. I stand with these #AngelFamilies. We must secure our border, end sanctuary cities, &amp; stop illegal alien crime in America. https://t.co/7uPhbmrwwq RT @JECRepublicans: Jobs numbers üî∫

Thank you to our Thin Blue Line for always looking out for the safety and well-being of Tennessee families. https://t.co/Ockvpm7nqB Honored to be one of 66 House Members to receive @NTU's "Taxpayers' Friend Award" this year.  I have always fought for lower taxes, limited government, &amp; economic freedom because you know how to spend your money better than the government. https://t.co/hwpkpGuku6 See below my statement on co-sponsoring H.R. 6702 - Congressman Bilirakis' solution to give law enforcement more tools to combat the #opioidcrisis. We must continue to do everything we can to help safeguard Tennessee communities that are being destroyed by this epidemic. https://t.co/nYaVEg6TvS Local retailers &amp; small businesses are the backbone of Tennessee's economy. Grateful to be recognized as a Hero of Main Street by @NRFNews. I will continue to push for regulatory relief, workforce development, &amp; tax cuts. #retailadvocates https://t.co/PmFEqncy8u Tax cuts work. Tennessee is continuing to see real results from our pro-growth economic policies. ‚ÄúMillions of people have found work, layoffs have fallen to levels last seen in the late 1960s, incomes are rising &amp; businesses are investing.‚Äù #BetterOffNow https://t.co/ChpzTt6Kvp Great to see @FCC continue helping us close the #digitaldivide. Several TN providers won grants such as @BLConnect, @HolstonConnect &amp; Meriwether Lewis Connect - thank you for your work in ensuring Tennesseans can participate in the 21st century economy no matter where they live. https://t.co/4o8A67XXOW RT @TNFarmBureau: We are grateful to have representatives who support Tennessee farmers. Thank you to @MarshaBlackburn, @DesJarlaisTN04, @R‚Ä¶ Obama‚Äôs 2015 WOTUS rule was an unconstitutional power grab by the federal government. It will hurt TN farmers &amp; the entire TN agriculture community. I am leading the effort with my TN colleagues in urging the @EPA to fight this rule &amp; #repealWOTUS. Read our letter below. https://t.co/WWzlZwmhiD .@DEAHQ announced it is investigating several pharmacies in Clay County.  Data indicates these pharmacies purchased nearly 1.5 million pills in 2017.  We must continue to fight the opioid epidemic by combatting, diversion, abuse and trafficking. Thank you #ThinBlueLine! This morning I visited @ORNL &amp; @y12nsc with @SenAlexander &amp; @RepChuck. From nuclear innovation to supercomputers to AI, Oak Ridge is leading our nation when it comes to solving some of the world's most compelling challenges. Thank you, Director Zacharia  &amp; the entire ORNL team. https://t.co/7WQ0akQFdg .@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for loving our troops every day of your life. He will forever be remembered as one of America‚Äôs greatest heroes. His character, courage, and patriotism serve as an example to us all. Rest In Peace, @SenJohnMcCain. https://t.co/U01BAJYfPZ One of my great honors of representing #TN07 is having the privilege of nominating some of our state's finest young men &amp; women to our prestigious U.S. Service Academies. Incredibly proud of these bright young people &amp; wish them all the best in the next chapter of their lives. https://t.co/uN5GP1kfSc Such a pleasure to meet with the Garrison Command Team at @FortCampbell with my good friend, @SenJoniErnst. Eternally grateful for these brave soldiers of the @101stAASLTDIV who sacrifice every day to defend our freedoms &amp; keep America safe. https://t.co/jnuhey5fU5 Happy to have Team Blackburn represented at @MidTnElectric's broadband expansion announcement in Thompson's Station today. We must continue working to close the digital divide and make certain Tennesseans have a 21st Century Internet for a 21st Century economy. https://t.co/mrdpCE193b May God bless John McCain, a true American hero who has served his country with the utmost honor and integrity as a Navy Captain, Prisoner of War, and highly distinguished U.S. Senator. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. Our pro-growth policies in Congress are moving more Americans from welfare to work. #BetterOffNow https://t.co/eOJrhkK2Wo .@Bridgestone is one of many successful businesses that chose Tennessee as their home, bringing hundreds of jobs &amp; economic development to #TN07. Today, I sent a letter to Commerce @SecretaryRoss urging him to approve their exclusion request from 232 steel tariffs. https://t.co/WmhM3UCyAL The Obama administration's Waters of the US (WOTUS) rule threatens Tennessee farmers &amp; ranchers with unnecessary, burdensome regulations. Another example of unconstitutional gov't overreach. Yesterday, I signed a letter asking Farm Bill conferees to #repealWOTUS once and for all. https://t.co/2rMOFIkxhP Thanks to #TaxCutsandJobsAct, Nashville-based Advance Financial increased 401(k) matches for every employee from 3% to 5% &amp; increased charitable giving by 8%. This means more money and retirement security for Tennesseans. #BetterOffNow https://t.co/e068d0RS9Q Another great sign of Tennessee's growing economy. Jobs, jobs, jobs!  @ChickfilA #TN07 https://t.co/Zn1pXFPJHH Deeply saddened by the loss of Chief Warrant Officer 3 Taylor J. Galvin- one of @FortCampbell's 160th SOAR finest aviators. His sacrifice in service to our nation &amp; our freedom will never be forgotten. My deepest condolences to this hero's family &amp; friends https://t.co/fpVqcgDj6u .@ICEgov &amp; @CBP keep our Tennessee communities &amp; children safe from human traffickers &amp; deadly drugs like #fentanyl. Read my op-ed on why I support the men &amp; women of the Thin Blue Line: https://t.co/6MpG8COlO8 https://t.co/DNrYSOee3M Grateful to have led the effort on getting National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act signed into law. A 3-digit number for those struggling with mental health is a game changer. We must do all we can to stop this growing crisis in TN. Thank you, @TSPNorg. https://t.co/ecWkCKX0Fm Chelsea Clinton's comments are despicable. What kind of morally-depraved world are we living in when killing innocent children is accepted for economic benefit? I will always stand for life. https://t.co/yq8psIF9v8 Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump signed into law the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years. The 2019 #NDAA increases funding for training &amp; equipment, and provides much-needed resources to rebuild our military &amp; upgrades to Tennessee's defense installations like @FortCampbell. https://t.co/AifoDNBMKz Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, Brentwood-based @TractorSupply is increasing workers wages &amp; investing in new stores around the great state of Tennessee. According to @taxfoundation, Tennessee is expected to add over 14,500 full time jobs by 2020. This is a winning economy. #TBT Had the privilege of attending the 60th Anniversary of #DDay in 2004 to honor our veterans and those who bore the ultimate sacrifice.  God bless America and our brave men and women in uniform who keep us safe. @FortCampbell @101stAASLTDIV https://t.co/yAp4qZiiXT The fundamental problem is that Silicon Valley doesn‚Äôt believe that what Republicans say is ‚Äúspeech‚Äù.  These aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù or a series of unfortunate coincidences. We are being deliberately censored. #stopthebias Parkers Crossroads Veterans Cemetery will serve more than 45,000 veterans &amp; their families within 17 rural counties in west Tennessee. Thank you @ColonelTDVS &amp; @TNDVS for your work in creating this field of honor for us to remember &amp; reflect on the selfless service of TN veterans https://t.co/gK02Ytk6tz Honored to take part in the dedication ceremony for the #Veterans Cemetery at Parkers Crossroads today.  Tennessee veterans and their families deserve the utmost respect and honor for their sacrifice.  Thank you to them, @BillHaslam and all who participated. https://t.co/FMmHd9ycRv Calls to prosecute @ICEgov agents for enforcing our laws are absurd. These men &amp; women put their lives on the line to protect our communities from illegal drugs, human trafficking, &amp; gang violence. I #StandWithICE and @POTUS' nomination of Ronald Vitiello. https://t.co/4QAd5Y2aRR 157,000 new jobs were added in July. Unemployment is down to 3.9%.
