They are advocating for open borders and, last year, they tried to abolish ICE. Some even want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP want to secure our southern border by investing in personnel, advanced technology, and physical barriers. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe A migrant caravan of 2,000 people reached our border yesterday. It’s time for .@SpeakerPelosi and @Democrats to admit the truth that physical barriers will protect Americans. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe We must build physical barriers to stop the flow of human trafficking, sex trafficking, drugs, and weapons from pouring into our communities. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe During the past two years, House Republicans have focused on making our communities safer, passing legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis and investing in new resources for mental health, training, and school safety programs. #SOTU Under .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP, for the first time in 75 years, the United States is now a net exporter of oil. #EnergyIndependence #SOTU The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is at its lowest since 1969. #SOTU In 2018, Georgia was ranked the #1 state to do business; marking the 5th time in a row for this ranking. #SOTU Over the past 12 months, Georgia has added 113,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.9% #SOTU Throughout 2018 Women’s unemployment rate reached a 65-year low; Veterans unemployment rate reached an 18-year low; and Youth unemployment rate reached a 48-year low. #SOTU Since .@realDonaldTrump took office, more than 5.3 million jobs have been created, and we now even have record low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. #SOTU ...and appropriated funds to procure, replace, and upgrade platforms, weapons, and equipment to maintain military superiority. #SOTU During the past two years .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP rebuilt our military force, adding 20,000 troops; gave our men and women in uniform the largest pay raise since 2010... Under .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP’s leadership, the American economy has been unleashed like never before. We now have more open jobs than workers to fill those jobs. #SOTU Looking forward to the State of the Union Address tonight at 9:00 pm ET.

This Bible reminds me of the importance of God in my life and in the founding of this great nation. https://t.co/41BBl0i1zQ The problem at our southern border is a humanitarian one. A physical barrier, border patrol, and surveillance technology will significantly discourage migrants from making this dangerous, sometimes deadly journey. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst https://t.co/RuQKFonJ7F In 2017 and 2018, 30,000 illegal immigrants were arrested in the interior of the U.S. for sex crimes, and 4,000 for homicides. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst The numbers below indicate that boots on the ground and surveillance technology are not enough to combat the crisis at our southern border. We also need a physical barrier. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst https://t.co/cN2kaMLlYf We need a physical deterrent at our southern border, so the 1 in 3 women who are sexually assaulted on the journey northward, don’t attempt the dangerous trek. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst The sheer increase of illegal drugs pouring into the U.S. only reaffirms our need for more security, including a border wall. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst https://t.co/kGYgE9WKl1 There is a crisis at our southern border. The president is right; we need to build the border wall. Democrats have supported a border wall in the past, what happened? #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst Congratulations to @ClemsonUniv Trevor Lawrence, from my hometown-Cartersville, Georgia, on a great game, and his team winning the National Championship.
