https://t.co/MTmX5gSbOa I'm thankful to the courts, especially San Diego's Judge Dana Sabraw, for ruling families separated under the zero-tolerance policy must be reunited. It's because of them families are together. It's up to us to ensure this never happens again. #KeepFamiliesTogether I’m relieved the Office of Refugee Resettlement has successfully reunited thousands of children with their parents, but there’s more work to be done. I urge the Trump Administration to prioritize reunification of any children still separated from their families. The Trump Administration's failed family separation policy is cruel, immoral, and un-American. It is horrific to know that our government caused this pain and reuniting families is the least we can do. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/qYEMqnPCtd Congrats to Chloe from La Jolla.

https://t.co/dltNsgoOXj It's time to #HonorWithAction. #HR8 https://t.co/ZCLoMk7fm2 @RodneyDavis Many employers already offer this benefit, but we can help encourage more companies to offer this benefit across the country.

That would move us closer to solving the student debt crisis. It's time Congress does our part. @RodneyDavis Our bill would encourage more employers to offer repayment assistance as a tax-exempt benefit up to $5,250 a year—similar to tax exemptions for tuition assistance programs. Employees would be able to pay down their debt faster. Our growing student debt crisis requires innovative solutions. That's why I'm introducing the Employer Participation in Repayment Act with @RodneyDavis and 96 of our colleagues to help borrowers pay down their student loan debt.

https://t.co/lzvE3dBf2I Today, more than 37,500 federal employees in California won't get their paychecks.

The only people hurt by the shutdown are hardworking Americans. It's time to put people over politics. #EndTheShutdown
https://t.co/qp11z60qF2 Trump's threat to withhold disaster assistance from California is disgraceful and cruel to people, who lost everything.

It was also dishonest. We're asking him to retract his misleading statement and restore disaster assistance to these communities. https://t.co/e88Co1fdbP What we need at the border:
-new technology
-humanitarian aid
-more customs officers

What we don't need:
-an expensive, ineffective wall
https://t.co/DsAALXUfbJ @SupervisorCox @ScottPetersSD @RepSusanDavis Thanks @SupervisorCox for your solid work to identify solutions. If the president can declare an emergency every time he doesn’t get his way in appropriations, the power of Congress over the budget is eviscerated. Is there no principled limit to your political pandering? #OpenTheGovernment https://t.co/39qqVUZSzC Thank you, Wendy, for your years of leadership at @ABASD. I look forward to working with Yen Tu to support our AAPI communities and business owners.
https://t.co/Yki2ak01BM In San Diego, our top research institutions are making groundbreaking discoveries that can improve millions of lives.
 
The #TrumpShutdown threatens that progress. It's time to end this. #EndTheShutdown
https://t.co/Zq3RGJPebU Last year, we welcomed @InterConHotels to Downtown San Diego--the largest hotel to open in CA last year. We approved the development during my time as Port Commissioner-- a great addition to our top tourism industry.
https://t.co/s0bKvtZwb8 We've lost far too many lives to senseless gun violence.

97 percent of Americans support commonsense background check laws and yet, bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. Congress must step up and pass #HR8. #NeverAgain https://t.co/qXFSXPETqe Day 20 of the #TrumpShutdown: @TSA workers are now quitting and calling in sick, @US_FDA stopped routine food inspections, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will not get their paychecks tomorrow.

This needs to end now. https://t.co/MpjSczPs5J Walls don't work--steel or any other kind.

#EndTheShutdown
https://t.co/vwqMYaBDwI Many veterans choose to continue their service in the public sector, accounting for more than 30 percent of our federal workforce.
 
San Diego's large veterans population could be hurt by a continued shutdown. That's no way to honor their service.
https://t.co/eBCYqiIFdt Thank you to @SanDiegoPD and our law enforcement officers in San Diego for their bravery and sacrifices to keep our communities safe.
#LawEnforcementAppreciationDay As a Coast Guard City, San Diego knows the men and women of @USCG are an integral part of border security.
 
They're not able to do their job because the president is holding them hostage over a proposal that completely ignores maritime operations.
https://t.co/150wDqX3Kc Republicans have repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA and rip health care away from millions of Americans. Thankfully, the House can now take action to protect coverage, including coverage for preexisting conditions, while we work to stabilize the market.
https://t.co/BxzmpPwVhu What's really disgraceful is suggesting we would not help our fellow Americans after the worst wildfire season in California's history. That's not who we are.
 
How about we reduce the frequency and scope of wildfires by addressing the real cause: climate change. https://t.co/ITW3Kr9ekj Helped pass the Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act to increase subcontracting opportunities for small businesses and create a dispute process when subcontractors don't get paid.
https://t.co/j9mNXiSMez The bill also includes my amendment to strengthen the Public Health Emergency Fund by giving @CDCgov more than $150 million to pay for these predictably unpredictable public health emergencies in a responsible and transparent way. https://t.co/tyGjZElJAc Last year, San Diego experienced a deadly Hep A outbreak on the heels of a deadly flu season. It's clear we need to be prepared. That's why I voted to reauthorize programs to address bio-threats and enhance federal preparedness and response programs. Every day Trump keeps the government closed, America’s small businesses pay the price. @SBAgov can't provide small businesses the capital they need to grow--that's hundreds of millions of dollars in lost loans &amp; contracting opportunities. #EndTheShutdown 
https://t.co/K69KyqR3x4 Does the @WhiteHouse understand the IRS still needs to announce a start to filing season?
 
Not to mention-- 70,000 IRS workers are furloughed thanks to the #TrumpShutdown. The real solution is to get the government working again. 
https://t.co/OuSGXKEyUO Trump's @EPA can re-calculate the numbers all they want. They're still wrong.
 
Bottom line: They would rather save "industry" money than save lives and protect public health. 
https://t.co/IS9P4Nr2G3 8 years ago, @GabbyGiffords and 18 others were shot in Tuscon. Since then, Gabby has been a tireless advocate for action on gun violence. Today, I'm proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues  in supporting expanded background checks for all gun sales. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/2SNVU8JFNU Congratulations to @GavinNewsom on being sworn in as California's 40th governor. I look forward to working with you to expand opportunity for San Diegans and see that California continues to lead on climate change.
https://t.co/uYOWgOqKOS The @fleetscience High Tech Fair is coming to Balboa Park January 17th and 18th. Students from grades 7-12 can learn more about a career in STEM fields. Details here ↓
https://t.co/KU6VM4fCAE Republicans repeatedly voted to rip health care away from millions of Americans last year, including those with pre-existing conditions.

Now, @HouseDemocrats are fighting to defend your access to health care. 
https://t.co/iDAVnl9bYD Clearly, you can't because you're still holding the government hostage to your wasteful wall. 

Meanwhile, the only ones feeling the pain are hardworking Americans. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/OTKlPOLRvW During his visit to the border, I hope the president can see how the border is an opportunity—not a threat—like we do in San Diego. 

The humanitarian crisis created by his administration won't be solved with a wasteful wall.  
https://t.co/jSDWjjstmk This week, the House adopted rules to ensure a more transparent and inclusive legislative process for the #116thCongress. It's time we get back to a government that works for San Diegans and provides opportunity for all.
https://t.co/MGKuU4jU3L Our bill to ensure all deployed servicemembers are eligible for education and career counseling is now law. Now, guardsmen and reservists have our support as they work to become integrated and self-sufficient members of our communities. https://t.co/94lv41HYjC So glad to hear. #teampeters works to make DC accessible to visiting San Diegans - thanks for letting us help! https://t.co/KsBtlTiKjv RT @ReformationDC: Welcome back Lutherans who serve in Congress! God bless your servant-leadership. @ZoeLofgren @RepScottPeters @RepShimkus… A new office for a new Congress. Come visit us in 2338 Rayburn. https://t.co/kq6SmJzuIm Congrats to @ForgeThera, which will be able to expand their research to fight drug-resistant superbugs with this new funding. #SDLifeChanging https://t.co/CmflUurKDJ In San Diego, we know that rent and housing costs are rising faster than paychecks. That's why I plan to reintroduce the Rent Relief Act to provide a refundable tax credit to renters who paid more than 30% of their gross income on rent the previous year.
https://t.co/GLu8TpfbQG Congratulations to @NancyPelosi, Speaker of the House for the 116th Congress. https://t.co/ATnd6knMYW Today begins the #116thCongress filled with new opportunities to serve #CA52.
 
It's an honor to represent you in a new House committed to progress. https://t.co/gSvay0r6Kx On Jan. 2 1965, MLK Jr. led a voting rights campaign in Selma, which was wrought with segregation and disenfranchisement of African American voters.

Today we must continue his fight to ensure every American can exercise their right to vote freely. https://t.co/cBO9AHxvAG Saddened to hear we lost Don Breitenberg, a decorated World War II veteran and resident of La Jolla and later, PB.

It was an honor to help recognize Don for his service and sacrifice. May he rest in peace. 
https://t.co/T8k6qNdc2w The partial government shutdown means @CABRILLONPS is closed and its employees are furloughed. Tourism is a pillar of San Diego's economy, which means our region is losing revenue from visitors, too. 
https://t.co/hs2n5KxBva Headed back to D.C. today to get the government working for the people again. Democrats are going to pass measures Senate Republicans previously supported. It’s pure hypocrisy if the Senate refuses to pass them now.

Time to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/oQd080RrLE Happy New Year, San Diego! Wishing everyone a happy, healthy &amp; prosperous 2019. https://t.co/UKgtH9vrHj As we conclude 2018, I’m thankful to represent San Diego, Coronado, and Poway in Congress. As always, I’ve centered my service around San Diego—our people, our economy, and our values. It’s an honor to represent you and I look forward to continuing our work in 2019. #2018inReview https://t.co/DfmGMiQceC Merry Christmas, San Diego—from my family to yours. https://t.co/2b8aRYI0tz The holidays can be a difficult time for some, who may experience loneliness, stress, anxiety, or PTS. Please know you are not alone.

You can also text HOME TO 741741. RT @Mikel_Jollett: Let me get this straight,

This con man sold the Wall as something “Mexico” would pay for but now he’s making 800,000 fe… @hatetofakeit I’ve made two trips to the shelters and one to TJ. No press though - the organizers felt publicity could hurt the cause. I made a financial contribution to @JFSSD. And you can get the press releases you missed from my staff, who are volunteering at the shelter today &amp; tonight. DC is for weekdays, but I stayed today so we could vote to reopen government. Now the Senate is closed until Thursday. When Trump wants to talk seriously about 21st century border security (not a $30B medieval wall), we can get our government going &amp; our workers their paychecks. https://t.co/AZo3AzA8gG Last month, the national debt surpassed $21.8 trillion. That’s largely due to the Republican tax bill that became law one year ago. Tax cuts still don’t pay for themselves. It's time Congress passed a real budget and made fiscally responsible choices. 
https://t.co/9rZHpnuBbA #BlueWaterNavy veterans served our country honorably, but we failed them.
 
I joined a bipartisan group of my Veteran’s Committee colleagues to urge the Senate to pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and give our heroes the care they earned. They can’t wait any longer. https://t.co/56ldqMDL77 RT @DeptVetAffairs: Secretary Wilkie: VA not affected in the event of partial government shutdown https://t.co/Lr6FqR9nqm .@BudgetHawks’ Maya MacGuineas : “Our spending is unsustainable.” The consequences are slower economic, growth, higher interest rates, reduced budget flexibility, and risk of eventual fiscal crisis.
 
Time to #FixtheDebt
https://t.co/tpitWQ2gtu Homeless Persons' Memorial Day remembers those lost to violence and poor health--victims of our failure to address homelessness.  San Diego must learn from the deadly Hep A crisis we experienced last year that left too many vulnerable. #HomelessPersonsMemorialDay President Trump is jeopardizing government funding over the construction of a wasteful monument to himself and congressional Republicans are complicit.

I came here to make government work and stand ready to find a consensus that keeps the government open.
https://t.co/ULZ0sZUwLo This holiday season, @TSA estimates a record number of flyers from mid-December to early January.  Here are 3 tips for the best travel experience:
✔️ Pack Smart
✔️ Renew your TSA Pre✓ membership
✔️Ask for passenger support through TSA Cares I’m alarmed the VA would not spend funds allocated for suicide prevention outreach when 20 veterans die by suicide each day.
 
The president must hold his administration accountable for the irresponsible findings in this report. 
https://t.co/XHqBxpuagM Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and contributes to air pollution that threatens public health and the environment.

We sent a letter to @EPAAWheeler to oppose their disastrous proposed rule, which would weaken emission standards. https://t.co/lD3tN2j2C2 Open enrollment for @CoveredCA is extended. San Diegans now have until Friday, December 21st to enroll for coverage starting January 1st. 
 
The last day to enroll in healthcare plans is still January 15th.
