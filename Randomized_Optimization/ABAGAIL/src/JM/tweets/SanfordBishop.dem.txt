Today’s Black History Month spotlight is on a literary giant whose phenomenal ability to turn pain into poetry garnered the attention of many. She was the gifted poet, author, civil rights activist, &amp; entertainer, Dr. Maya Angelou.  #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/ynDbdC1nhH As a proud Eagle Scout, I would like to wish @boyscouts a Happy 109th Birthday! The valuable skills, traditions, &amp; principles that you have instilled in your members have helped prepare them for what lies ahead &amp; makes them better leaders for tomorrow. I was saddened to learn of the passing of my friend &amp; fmr colleague, Rep. John Dingell. A true public servant, he was a WW2 veteran, &amp; the longest serving Congressman of 59 years. My condolences go to @RepDebDingell &amp; their entire family. His spirit lives on through his legacy. I am proud to join my colleagues in supporting the Veteran’s Access to Child Care Act. Veterans should never have to choose their healthcare over the care of their child. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/kejQECIyr1 Macon native Johnny Jenkins was a self-taught guitarist, singer, and songwriter who massively influenced the careers of Otis Redding &amp; Jimi Hendrix. #BlackHistoryMonth #GA02 

Listen here:
https://t.co/ryp0iuWAo7 I urge the President to support the efforts of the bipartisan, bicameral conference committee as it negotiates an agreement to fund our government. The American people cannot afford to have their government let them down again.

https://t.co/S6ZVwCHwiw The President spoke of bipartisanship, and I hope this sentiment is sincere. However, he must abandon his divisive rhetoric, and put action behind his words. In the next week, we must avoid another disastrous shutdown and keep the government open. Renowned sociologist &amp; civil rights activist Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois said, “Believe in life! Always human beings will live and progress to greater, broader, and fuller life.” 
Remember that you were put here for a purpose: to be greater, broader, &amp; fuller. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/vptcBuwdhv I am keeping former Congressman Dingell, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and their family and friends in my prayers during this trying time. “The Genius of Soul,” Ray Charles Robinson, was born on September 23, 1930 in Albany, GA. The legendary, Grammy award–winning pioneer was best known for his soulful hits like “Georgia on My Mind,” “Hit the Road, Jack,” and “I Got A Woman.” #BlackHistoryMonth #GA02 https://t.co/mkGxJuztA2 Booker T. Washington once said, “Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome...” As you travel on your journey to success, remember to stop &amp; celebrate every victory, no matter how small. #BHM https://t.co/yOtFBIzyKZ “It is my wish that Americans reflect on the contributions &amp; struggles that African-Americans have endured so that we can commit to striving towards an inclusive society.” #BHM

His legacy lives on through his groundbreaking career in baseball (as the 1st AA to break the Major League’s color barrier), heroic civil rights activism, &amp; brave service to our country. https://t.co/xx6pRjGJTw I am a proud supporter of the Social Security 2100 Act. Social Security lifts more Americans out of poverty than any other program and must be kept strong for the future! #Secure2100 https://t.co/u34yKDYzcQ &amp; debate on border control security measures. In the meantime, I stand ready to do all I can to undo this damaging shutdown &amp; give relief to the selfless 800,000 federal workers &amp; all other Americans who have been hurt from this shutdown. I was relieved to hear that @POTUS will sign legislation to reopen the gov't for 3 weeks. This will allow fed workers &amp; contractors to be paid &amp; provide Americans w/ the services to which they have been deprived. For 35 days we've asked to reopen the gov't, pay our workers, Let’s reopen the government, pay our federal workers, &amp; get them back to work for their sake, their family’s sake, &amp; the sake of all American people. Let’s do our job so they can do theirs. https://t.co/GA1iNF3ODa I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Congressman Jack Brinkley. He was a great representative for SWGA &amp; he served his community w/ distinction. Our nation has lost an exceptional public servant, &amp; I have lost a trusted friend &amp; mentor. https://t.co/Iz1KX00Zzz Today, the House will vote to reopen the gov’t so federal workers do not miss their 2nd paycheck this Friday. Let’s get them back to work while we negotiate border security &amp; immigration policy in a bipartisan fashion as the gov’t was meant to work! Today we pay homage to the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He said it best, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is: what are you doing for others?” My office has compiled a list of FAQs to help guide you through the government shutdown. https://t.co/FLpmNji6BI If you have any additional questions, feel free to contact my offices. https://t.co/f0XSvFzbn8 Nat. disasters devastated our communities &amp; they're in need of recovery. This bill will provide them w/ the tools they need to repair &amp; rebuild. I urge the Senate to pass this bill &amp; send it to the Pres. so we can reopen the gov &amp; help the ppl in need. https://t.co/UYpsVQglKM Hurricane Michael devastated SWGA. Producers suffered near 100% crop losses &amp; the pecan, peanut, cotton, vegetable, &amp; poultry industries experienced significant damages. I thank @AustinScottGA08 &amp; the bipartisan cosponsors for this solution. https://t.co/m0DutyBqnh Gifted w/ the genius to articulate the hopes &amp; aspirations of the masses in their quest for freedom, no man has done more to bring dignity to the common man than Rev. Dr. MLK, Jr. 

Happy Birthday Dr. King, you continue to inspire us every day. #MLK90 https://t.co/PUF5aW5C73 The shutdown becomes more precarious every day that it continues. We all fall victim to this shutdown. I urge my Senate colleagues to vote on this legislation &amp; send it to the President’s desk &amp; end this shutdown. https://t.co/k66DR0C1aw “…millions of Americans will not be able to have their tax returns processed so they can receive the refunds on which they rely to make purchases, pay bills and school tuition.” Watch more here -&gt; https://t.co/fISxOCWnxB The Ocmulgee Mounds is a true cultural &amp; archaeological treasure to GA &amp; the nation. I am confident that this important bipartisan legislation will strengthen the current Ocmulgee National Monument &amp; bolster the economy &amp; cultural life of GA &amp; beyond. https://t.co/AT6OgRUedp After Hurricane Michael devastated my constituents’ crops, several farmers received D-Snap. The admin’s cont’d shutdown puts D-Snap at risk &amp; threatens the livelihood of farmers/families in GA02. @POTUS should reopen the gov’t before more damage is done. It is vital that Congress addresses the needs of communities in Georgia and across the nation that are still rebuilding from Hurricane Michael &amp; other recent disasters. I will continue my fight to pass a robust disaster relief bill that will help rebuild after Hurricane Michael. https://t.co/ioZ889V0XU The longer this shutdown continues over a border wall, the longer federal workers, farmers, &amp; families will remain in uncertainty. It's Congress’ first &amp; foremost duty to come together &amp; govern responsibly for the American people &amp; keep the government open &amp; functioning. https://t.co/kN4SmLjkmy The CR that was put before the House was an insufficient response to the needs of the American people. We must meet the needs of my constituents &amp; Americans rebuilding from recent disasters &amp; we must pass a funding bill that would avoid a gov shutdown. https://t.co/GXx1rDKwbw Congratulations to @downindecatur, @LCHSTrojans, &amp; all #GA02 teams represented in the 2018-2019 @OfficialGHSA State Football Championships!
