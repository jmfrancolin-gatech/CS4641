It is time for Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer to finally negotiate in good faith, and stop holding federal workers hostage with their partisan agenda. Democrats offered the American people a better way, but their first month in office has demonstrated nothing more than an unwillingness to work across the aisle. Continuing resolutions are simply a stopgap - kicking the can on critical issues like the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.
