This is unacceptable. Strides have been made towards equal pay for equal work, but we still aren‚Äôt there yet. Read more about #EqualPayDay here. https://t.co/MiJcow7jZG African American women are paid 63 cents on the dollar, compared to working men -- meaning they have to work until August 7th, more than a half a year later, to catch up. Why is today #EqualPayDay? According to research, working women in America are paid just 80 cents on the dollar, compared to working men -- meaning they have to work 20% longer to catch up. And for women of color, the pay gap is much wider. After church this morning, I stopped by Cafe New Castle for an excellent and delicious breakfast. I'm proud to support Delaware's small businesses that power our economy and enrich our communities! https://t.co/wEb7QFKOm4 This evening many will gather around the table for Passover Seder.
