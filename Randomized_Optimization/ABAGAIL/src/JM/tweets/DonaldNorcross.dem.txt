https://t.co/xFMcBUDPWj .@EnvironmentNJ is rightfully bringing attention to energy-efficient &amp; renewable options with their Ride &amp; Drive events. By embracing our #cleanenergy future, our country can add good paying-jobs &amp; improve the economy overall. #Renewables #EnergyEfficiency https://t.co/bQyLaB5sF4 RT @RowanUniversity: ICYMI: Yesterday, U.S. Senator @CoryBooker &amp; Rep. @DonaldNorcross discussed issues with our student military personnel… American infrastructure needs an update – &amp; so do the paychecks of hard-working men &amp; women nationwide.

#ForThePeople https://t.co/jyJImoaRqP https://t.co/S3vW0xwKLz We know that the best way to shape policies is to listen to our constituents — &amp; these heroic @RowanUniversity students are providing valuable insights about their experiences serving our nation &amp; studying in our state.

#ThankYouForYourService #CollegeAffordability #ForThePeople https://t.co/AWglrB8nBG Looking forward to seeing you &amp; talking to students! https://t.co/G4n8wSksFC What President Trump is suggesting is unconstitutional &amp; goes against American values. 

We are a nation of immigrants. We always have been &amp; always will be. https://t.co/2IZINaxFJc I’m going to be honest - I’m angry. But we gathered in peace at Temple Beth El together tonight, through the devastation &amp; anger, &amp; I’m forever proud to be part of our community.

#HateHasNoHomeHere (3/3) “Tree of Life,” the name of the Pittsburgh synagogue, is from Proverbs 3:18, which says, “[The Torah] is a Tree of Life to those who hold fast to it &amp; all its supporters are happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness &amp; all its paths are peace.” (2/3) Over 800 members of our #SouthJersey Jewish community gathered to remember &amp; pray for those horrifically killed in Pittsburgh yesterday. (1/3) https://t.co/KwjNrxIsM7 Devastating news out of Pittsburgh today. My prayers are with the members of the Tree of Life synagogue &amp; our brave first responders.

Hate, anti-Semitism &amp; violence have no place in our country. We must take meaningful action to stop tragedies like this before they happen! Grateful this was intercepted. Thank you to the postal workers &amp; investigators who are keeping our friends &amp; colleagues safe.

Political violence is *never* the answer. https://t.co/vH3K1v4pok Visited Camden County Jail w/@JonYoungSr &amp; @BillMoen to listen to individual’s experiences &amp; announce an innovative funding project to reduce recidivism. Programs like this help improve our criminal justice system &amp; provide opportunities for successful re-entry into the community https://t.co/appPwuNrVm It's good news that Congress' opioid package is now law, &amp; while we take a positive step forward today, we still must increase mental health &amp; addiction funding &amp; safeguard coverage for people w/pre-existing conditions. One preventable death is too many.

https://t.co/siicq6Gf32 With one of #SouthJersey’s youngest advocates, Max Schill, &amp; his friends at Oak Knoll Elementary School. 

The 21st Century Cures Act wouldn’t have passed without Max’s hard work, &amp; I’m proud to have voted for this bill to help find cures for #rarediseases in Max’s honor. https://t.co/9gOivDHOHu Congrats to the 2018 Gloucester County @NAACP Game Changers! 

You are the leaders who know we need to focus on togetherness in the face of hate, &amp; will pave the way to a brighter future. https://t.co/16obtqcYB8 Thank you for including &amp; welcoming me.

Cultural diversity is what actually makes America great. https://t.co/RO4XzvSDok If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or visit https://t.co/yn0fWdp8Ns.

#DomesticViolenceAwarenessMonth #DVAM #DVAM2018 https://t.co/AqMjFCgLYS We’re wearing purple ribbons in @CamdenCountyNJ as we announce a new countywide effort to combat the #opioidepidemic. 

Project SAVE - that expands access to resources - is sensibly modeled on an already-successful program in Gloucester Township. https://t.co/DbmdZMHYjN I'll always stand on the right side of history by protecting &amp; advancing the rights of the LGBTQ community. 

I'm honored to receive 100% on @HRC’s Congressional Scorecard. #HRCScorecard https://t.co/vErVEMwSM9 https://t.co/R3Mymt1Dax Thank you Staff Sargent Ed Whalens for your dedication to our country &amp; our community. You are truly a hometown hero.

#ThankYouForYourService #GloucesterCityNJ #SouthJersey https://t.co/PTokPKu9RB TONIGHT @ 6:30: @CamdenCountyNJ Town Hall at Gloucester City Middle School. 

See you there!

https://t.co/z1mGsBcQJf RT @SteveAdubato: Great day of #1on1 intvs. @ @coopermedschool about impact of new Joint Health + Sciences building on #Camden + the resear… I’ve said it before &amp; I’ll say it again — hate, violence &amp; racism have no place in our communities or country.

This cowardly, offensive act is an attack against all of us, &amp; we must fully investigate this &amp; hold the individuals responsible accountable.

https://t.co/RQOWshj6Eg RT @RepBonnie: The deadline to register to vote is THIS TUESDAY! Click here to find your local county Board of Elections and get registered… It’s illogical that our nation’s workers are more productive than ever, but aren’t being rewarded for it. 

We can lift up over 40 million Americans living in poverty who will put money back into their local economies. https://t.co/9vVSWdSENA The best social program in the world is a good job with fair wages &amp; the dignity that comes with it.

Let’s make Amazon’s move a catalyst for action.

https://t.co/ES0uanrrLg Congrats to the @ZaneNorthPTA for being selected as a PTA #SchoolOfExcellence.

Great to meet the students, parents &amp; teachers who earned this distinction. https://t.co/whwPvOBh1M ICYMI - Congress passed legislation to help curb the #opioidepidemic that included my Jobs Plus Recovery Act (https://t.co/tD3CiDiF9Z) &amp; I joined @CoryBooker &amp; @SenatorMenendez to announce $900K+ to combat the crisis in Camden &amp; Atlantic Counties (https://t.co/KlvbDXCIIA). Today's #WorldMentalHealthDay, a good time to recommit to increasing mental health &amp; addiction funding. We must invest in our crumbling infrastructure! 

For example, we need more collaborative efforts to ease congestion &amp; make our highway systems safer. The District Connect Project in SJ is improving an area of roads I’ve not-so-fondly called ‘Malfunction Junction.’

I’m one of four boys raised in Pennsauken &amp; loved growing up in @CamdenCountyNJ. 

#SouthJersey #PennsaukenNJ #HarvestFestival #HometownPride https://t.co/TBmPi9n99f To all sexual assault survivors in South Jersey &amp; across the country: I hear you, I believe you, I share your outrage &amp; I stand with you today and always. Like millions of Americans who tuned in to the Senate hearings last week, I was struck by the bravery &amp; sincerity displayed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford &amp; appalled by the temperament, lack of transparency &amp; partiality displayed by Judge Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/NlIa3kXV3A Great to see so many people out at the @CamdenCountyNJ Health Fair. Always working to keep the cost of coverage down &amp; expand access to care for South Jerseyans.

#ProtectOurCare #ForThePeople https://t.co/9shdtgeP1y The  Trump  Administration  wants  to  gut  safety  regulations  put  in  place after #DeepwaterHorizon. They  may  have  forgotten  its  devastation, but we haven’t.

We don't want an oil spill off our Jersey Shore!!

#SafeCOASTAct  #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/PWGdZdMZfj Please be aware that this is happening soon – at 2:18 in NJ. It is just a test. https://t.co/FWHkmw45sE RT @janschakowsky: That's why today, @DonaldNorcross, @RepBonamici and I introduced the Women's Pension Protection Act. The bill improves s… RT @janschakowsky: As we work to win full equality for women in America, we cannot overlook the retirement gap. Because they are much more… BIG WIN FOR WORKERS: @Amazon is taking an important step forward. Congress should follow suit. A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay, it’s that simple.

#RaiseTheWage #FightFor15 #ForThePeople

https://t.co/HPAbeW2eSX Re #NAFTA: As I review this agreement, I’ll be making sure we are raising wages for workers, safeguarding workers’ rights &amp; reducing outsourcing. Above all, the newly agreed-upon terms must be properly enforced or else the negotiations will be meaningless. https://t.co/2ovHqmQxwf Proud to join @CityofCamdenGov to present @MalcolmJenkins with a key to the City.

He lifted up out spirits as a member of our Super Bowl-winning @Eagles, &amp; he lifts up our community with his foundation.

#MalcolmJenkinsFoundation #CamdenNJ #CamdenRises #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/BdnDd9L8jX Congrats @Rutgers_Camden on the nearly $550,000 for forensic science &amp; criminal justice research that will help improve law enforcement

https://t.co/p9jrFdEd2r This is repulsive. Is this what we're doing to make America great?!

We need comprehensive immigration reform. Now. Yesterday. Come on.

https://t.co/W88xNdaYmn Celebrating the re-opening of the South Jersey Federal Credit Union in Voorhees with union reps, local leaders &amp; members of the SJ business community.

#SouthJersey #UnionStrong #CreditUnions https://t.co/1j11Ha98GU The House just passed key legislation to help combat the #opioidepidemic, &amp; it includes provisions from my Jobs Plus Recovery Act. This allows us to invest in our friends &amp; neighbors when they need us most, &amp; our economy will be stronger as a result.

https://t.co/tD3CiDiF9Z I voted NO on the #GOPTaxScam 2.0.

We need more jobs, higher wages &amp; real tax relief for New Jersey families. We don’t need to add $3 trillion more to the debt &amp; have the middle class paying for tax breaks for CEOs.
