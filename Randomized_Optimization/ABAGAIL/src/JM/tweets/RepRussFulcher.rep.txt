Oddly, they… Happy Birthday to President Ronald Reagan- a true patriot! https://t.co/eeZX28GCOL I am 100% behind you Whip @SteveScalise &amp; @RepAnnWagner. Babies who survive an abortion should receive medical care. https://t.co/ncf4nfk0Cg Congrats to @DOIDepSec David Bernhardt on his nomination! Looking forward to working to decrease burdensome regulations, encourage local resource management, &amp; support both American energy independence &amp; the American workforce through wise management of our natural resources. https://t.co/TCKlBZ6QND RT @HouseGOP: .@RepRussFulcher predicts the President will highlight the success of the GOP tax cuts at tonight’s #SOTU. https://t.co/4pM4X… My colleagues @RepChipRoy &amp; @RepDanCrenshaw took a trip to the southern border for a first-hand account of the situation.

Let’s keep it up! This week I signed a letter with some of my freshman colleagues to @US_FDA Commissioner Gottlieb asking to ensure liquids labeled ‘milk’ are in fact milk. #COWnterfeits #MOOd #IDpol https://t.co/eX0okVTTJu Will be live on @KBOI670 at 5pm MST this evening- tune in! This week my Dem colleagues in @NatResources attempted to remove “Under God” from the oath taken by witnesses before they testify. 

I voted against this removal. 

I think it was God’s divine grace that helped found this nation and allowed us to prosper.
https://t.co/Cn4chjVUTg Subcommittee Assignments just announced! @NatResources @EdLaborCmte https://t.co/OiTosiVcFg H.R. 676 was introduced by Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) through the Foreign Affairs Committee. This legislation passed the House of Representatives on January 22, 2019 by a margin of 357 in support, 22 in opposition, and 54 remaining members who chose not to vote.  3/3 20+ countries currently don't pay their dues; in doing so increasing obligations to the U.S. If we remove our own ability to make any changes to our position in the future, we also remove any leverage we could have to hold other nations accountable to pull their own weight. 2/3 I've had a few q's regarding my vote against H.R. 676 (NATO Support Act by Rep. Panetta D-CA) &amp; I would like to explain my vote. First, I am not anti-NATO. Second, H.R.676 would empower foreign leaders with too much authority by locking the U.S. into the current terms of NATO.1/3 Celebrating National #SchoolChoice Week! Children deserve the opportunity to be successful in an environment that serves their unique educational needs. Let’s make sure parents have the ability to determine that for their kids! #ID01 https://t.co/QnPa0AWBnL Today 13 Democrats joined Republicans in a vote to immediately pay federal workers. Although we are still 8 members short from passing the bill, this number continues to decrease and I am proud to serve with those putting party politics aside to pay federal workers. https://t.co/WunV0mqkVi Looking forward to chatting with @AlanNathan on @mainstreetradio this afternoon at 3:51pm MST. Tune in here! https://t.co/orAv1cJL04 I also look forward to joining the @EdLaborCmte. I hope to use this role to empower state and local governments to enrich the educational experience of children in #ID01 &amp; ensure our higher education provides the necessary curriculum to support tech and service career paths. With its massive implication to Idaho’s economy and way of life, I am delighted to be chosen as a member of the @NatResources Committee. This assignment gives #ID01 a voice to encourage more local flexibility and authority over resource management practices. A very special visitor Miss Paoline Hsue and her mother stopped by my office to deliver a thank you card unlike any I have received. 

It was an honor to help locate a #ProLife clinic next door to planned parenthood in Boise to help mothers like yours choose life. https://t.co/K4M0g36asD Very proud to give my first speech on the House floor on an issue I care about deeply. #ProLife https://t.co/3xkxjFmIck An important reminder to not take for granted the religious freedoms we are granted in this great country.  #ReligiousFreedomDay https://t.co/vZozKeNFia RT @MikeCrapo: Idaho delegation members in the house, @RepRussFulcher and @CongMikeSimpson introduced a similar measure, H.R. 214.
