If you are an #AR3 resident, let me know what priorities you think should be included in a funding deal here: https://t.co/M9lld5pt92 Securing our border is a national security issue. Senator Schumer previously recognized that. It‚Äôs time for Democrats to come to the table and end this shutdown. Chuck Schumer in 2009: "Between 2005 and 2009, a vast amount of progress has been made on our borders and ports of entry.‚Äù

"This progress includes... construction of 630 miles of border fence that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration on our southern land border." Rest In Peace, Mr. Overton.

The Senate will have to take further action before another vote can happen. The House did pass a CR on Thursday, which funded the wall &amp; provided disaster aid. Negotiations will likely continue throughout the day &amp; possibly the week. Democrats have shown their hand‚Äîthey prefer open borders over an open government. We can‚Äôt avoid a partial #shutdown at this point, but Congress can control how long it lasts. It‚Äôs time for my Democratic colleagues to stop blocking efforts to secure our Southern Border. #AR3 https://t.co/8wgc2HZL0t Border security is national security. It‚Äôs Congress‚Äôs constitutional duty to fund the government, and it‚Äôs time for all representatives to do their job and fund critical priorities. (2/2) #AR3 #BorderSecurity Tonight, the House passed a CR that keeps our government running and secures our borders. Senate Democrats now have to decide whether they want to keep either our government or our porous Southern border open. The choice is obvious to me and millions of Americans.
