But it also serves as a reminder that our fight against draconian restrictions on abortion rights is still far from over – and why it's so important that we stay united in our efforts to protect reproductive rights. https://t.co/XEVAvJJGze John Dingell was a towering figure in Congress. He was a master legislator, known for his tireless preparation, good humor and dedication to public service and oversight. I was lucky to call John Dingell my mentor, and even luckier to call him my friend. He'll be forever missed. https://t.co/MjrgcQPD67 Just finished talking to @JoyAnnReid about our committee’s first oversight hearing today on President #Trump's cruel family separation policy and the harm it's caused thousands of children. Watch here: https://t.co/Wd0AnAs2xl Tune in to @MSNBC tonight at 6:20 pm MT/ 8:20 pm ET, where I'll be talking with @JoyAnnReid about what we learned today at our hearing on President #Trump's shameful family separation policy. RT @mitchellreports: https://t.co/5ALPjSbpaQ There is no evidence that HHS leaders ever tried to stop the administration’s abhorrent family separation policy. As the agency dedicated to the health and welfare of children, we need to know why. Here’s what I told them today: https://t.co/e5jnTd9qAn RT @ddiamond: Democrats are holding their first hearing on family separations, and @RepDianaDeGette goes straight after HHS in opening stat… In case you missed it, check out my interview on @Maddow about my Oversight hearing today on Trump’s Family Separation Policy. https://t.co/DKAKRMBmhg Tune into @maddow at 7:30 pm MT/9:30 pm ET tonight. I'll be talking about tomorrow’s much-anticipated oversight hearing on the president's shameful policy of separating families at the border. It’s unanimous! At the first @EnergyCommerce hearing on #ClimateChange in years, every single witness agreed: Climate Change is real and humans contribute to it. This is an important step in our effort to ensure science and facts guide environmental policy making. Watch: https://t.co/LU4mAmvTox RT @AbbySmithDC: .@RepDianaDeGette asks all the witnesses: “Do you all agree that climate change is real and human activity contributes?” A… Last night, Trump said he wants Congress to stop its "ridiculous" investigations of his administration. Sorry, Mr. President, as chair of the E&amp;C Oversight panel I can tell you: We're just getting started. Our first hearing is tomorrow on your shameful child-separation policy. Here’s my full statement on the president’s speech: https://t.co/B2IUHGCPnZ If Trump wants to work with us to find real solutions to our nation’s most pressing issues, then we are ready to work with him. But if he’s going to continue to deny climate change, roll back environmental regs and eliminate the ACA, then he’s going to have a fight on his hands What we heard tonight was classic state-of-the-union Trump, who tells everybody what they want to hear. Unfortunately, what we are forced to live with every other day is a president whose actions are doing real harm to our country. RT @MarisitaMo: Kennya is a Kindergarten teacher, Dreamer from Colorado, and a guest of @RepDianaDeGette at #SOTU. Thank you Congresswoman… RT @ProChoiceCaucus: It’s shameful that President Trump would use his #SOTU speech to peddle falsehoods and mischaracterizations about abor… Yesterday, I met with this amazing group of women Muslim leaders who, despite facing discrimination, are continuing to pursue the American dream. They are inspiring, and we had a good discussion about why we must stop the president’s #travelban. https://t.co/OMpPWsdmwu Tomorrow, two House committees – the Natural Resources Committee and @EnergyCommerce – are holding the first Congressional hearings on Climate Change since Trump took office. These hearings will end years of GOP neglect &amp; denial on the issue, and I will be participating in both. https://t.co/QjpwjJEBx9 During #BlackHistoryMonth , I'll be sharing facts about Colorado's black history, which has played a pivotal role in shaping our state and the western values we hold dear. There's so much to remember and celebrate this month and year round. https://t.co/DFwpRghjje Was great meeting with volunteers from @VOAColorado’s Foster Grandparent Program at Denver's Place Bridge Academy today. Ms. Ollie Morris, pictured here, has fostered 4th &amp; 5th grade students with special needs for 28 years. She’s an inspiring example of compassion &amp; service! https://t.co/LRNQQOrL8Y RT @SeniorCorps: Thank you @RepDianaDeGette for visiting @VOAColorado's Foster Grandparent Program at Place Bridge Academy in Denver today!… Just wrote to the head of the @DeptofDefense urging him not to implement #Trump's proposed ban on #transgender servicemembers, despite the Court’s decision to allow implementation. This baseless policy won't make our country safer, it’s just more bigotry. https://t.co/QmjhBoIzOF There were more than 26 billion robocalls placed in the U.S. last year – up 46% from the year before! We have to do more to stop these unwanted calls. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor legislation today to give @FCC the power it needs to crack down on these annoying calls. https://t.co/bUK4KVMgeZ Jonathan White, who wrote this recent report on behalf of the administration, will be appearing before my committee next week. I would suggest he come prepared to answer some very direct questions. These aren’t just numbers on a page, or names on a list - these are real kids, with real families, who are scared to death. The fact that the Trump administration hasn’t even ‘tried to determine the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities’ is inexcusable. Check out my e-newsletter recapping some of this week's important developments, including my work on @EnergyCommerce to get more information about the President's #FamilySeparation policy and the rising cost of #insulin. https://t.co/3rOKcoeAzx Today, we kick off #BlackHistoryMonth. While the legacy of African Americans in Colorado and across America should be celebrated year-round, I hope you’ll especially join us this month to take time to reflect on some of the most significant contributions made through our history. https://t.co/FgkVVcuixT I met yesterday with community leaders to discuss proposed changes to the so-called public charge rule. If approved, these changes would prevent many immigrants from getting the public assistance they need – and that’s why I sent a letter to @DHSgov opposing these changes. https://t.co/56Z9PC94qP I had a great discussion with a group of #climatechange activists in our community on Thursday. As chair of the @EnergyCommerce oversight panel, shining a light on the #Trump administration's failure to properly tackle climate change is one of my top priorities. https://t.co/6JQAHMKtto Our first oversight hearing on President Trump’s shameful family separation policy will be next Thursday, Feb. 7. Despite the public outrage, the previous Republican majority did nothing to hold the administration accountable. That ends next week. https://t.co/3ozLU0LeQT I'm honored to carry on the dedicated work of women leaders who came before me in getting this amendment ratified. We still need the #ERANow. Both offer new opportunities to protect women from unfair and unjust discrimination. Though we've made strides, we still need an amendment to enshrine the rights we deserve. That's why I have signed on to two resolutions -- one that would repeal the expired deadline for the original ERA, and another that creates a modified version of the ERA that explicitly guarantees equal rights for men and women. The push to ratify the #EqualRightsAmendment (ERA) was a bold effort to expand women's rights across America. But sadly, it wasn't ratified in time by enough states to become law of the land. 37 years after it missed the mark, its protections are still needed. Great meeting w/ @nfbco members, as well as these two amazing students, Deyannira Villa Cazares of Denver and Ian Lee of Aurora, who are on Capitol Hill today to help increase access to technology for the visually impaired, which is a critical goal for so many fellow Coloradans. https://t.co/IUrNRK1UjC I’m proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats today as a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure men and women receive equal pay for equal work. Progress in achieving this goal is still too slow, and we need to take bold action by passing this bill. https://t.co/k39ubRYADm We just sent letters to drug makers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, demanding to know why the price of insulin continues to skyrocket. This is a lifesaving drug that millions of Americans rely on – we can’t let its cost put it out of reach.   https://t.co/DUm5MsUgG6 https://t.co/dahEkrcHFp It’s been 10 years since Pres. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was a monumental step towards ensuring equal pay, but we still have a lot of work to do. I’m proud to continue to be working to close this unacceptable pay gap once and for all. https://t.co/lB5UxZSfbj #Trump's @EPA is trying to roll back our nation’s air quality standards to help big corporations make more money, while putting our health at risk. That’s not right. And that's why I am working with my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to hold them accountable. https://t.co/lFQ0vtUBNl Just sent a letter to the head of @EPA demanding info about the Trump administration’s plan to roll back air-quality standards. We’re not going to sit back and let this administration put Americans’ health at risk just so companies can make more money. https://t.co/3XBRk5hFiY New @USCBO report shows the #shutdown caused $3 billion in permanent damage to our economy.

Enough is enough. We need to end the shutdown now. Then, work with Congress to find real solutions to enhance our border security. Coloradans, and all Americans, deserve leadership - not a tantrum. I support enhancing our border security, but we need to have a real conversation about it instead of this “my way or the highway” approach President Trump is stuck on. The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government, but President #Trump and Senate Republicans refuse to end this shutdown. They are holding our government and economy hostage for a ridiculous wall. The American people deserve better. We need to end the #shutdown now. This is a devastating blow in the fight for #equality. I've been working to oppose this unjust policy from the beginning, and, despite this setback, we won't quit now. This is about legitimizing #trans Americans' inherent value -- in our military and our society at large. https://t.co/iJgulKBRr7 RT @RepWexton: From Denver, Colorado: "I'm getting worried about my mortgage payment coming up, I barely managed to ensure my student loans… As we recall both events this week, we're reminded that for every victory affirming and protecting our #reprorights, there is an effort to suppress them.

But tomorrow also marks two year's since President Trump reinstated the anti-choice Global Gag Rule, threatening that right for women around the world. It was a joy to once again participate in Denver’s annual #Marade, where we came together to honor Dr. King’s enduring legacy. His spirit is alive and well in our community, and we must continue working to fully realize his ideals across America and around the world. #MLKDay https://t.co/i4qCb5exiR Happy #MLKDay!

We're not there yet, but we can get closer if we remain united by Dr. King’s timeless ideals. https://t.co/nD1gX4qIQ2 First and foremost, he needs to end this shutdown immediately and then work with Congress on smart and effective border security methods that work. The president’s address shows he continues to have no problem using people’s lives and livelihoods as a bargaining chip for his dangerous agenda.

His first and only priority should be working with Congress to end this harmful #shutdown. DeGette said the pro-choice majority in the House was historic. “I can’t tell you what this means for protecting the full range of women’s health,” said DeGette. “Not just here in the United States but around the world.” @ProChoiceCaucus https://t.co/6DMWbgPWO3 Today, one year later, I presided over the House floor and there wasn’t one anti-choice bill in sight. Elections have consequences! https://t.co/zczywkAycI This time last year, I was fighting hard against a draconian, anti-choice bill House Republicans were pushing ahead of the March for Life. For at least the last 5 years, House Republicans voted on these types of bills ahead of the march. I'm proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWage Act, which increases the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024.

No more excuses. https://t.co/oMK52EYfwo Thrilled that my Senate colleagues have swiftly passed our bipartisan legislation — just two days after being unanimously approved by the House. This is a significant step in reducing America’s maternal mortality rate, which ensures more happy and healthy families. 👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/ZrIWiXRqoQ Here’s my statement on @HouseGOP's shameless and embarrassing hearing today that sought to discredit life-saving fetal tissue research. We won't put up with these anti-choice sideshows in the next Congress. Sound science must lead the way. https://t.co/3qeRMen8eQ Two years after 21st Century Cures was signed into law, I am amazed by the progress it has made in fighting diseases and improving public health. This bipartisan effort is saving lives, and we must work toward similar reforms in the new Congress. https://t.co/23Nfv80ELQ https://t.co/Catxp8F2pL Tomorrow marks one year since @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. Over the past year, millions of Americans have voiced their support for restoring #NetNeutrality rules, and I'll continue fighting for the free and open internet. https://t.co/Uh6VwCjw3b If true, this inexplicably heartless decision will endanger Vietnamese refugees who have lived in this country for decades and built new lives. I expressed my strong opposition to this proposal in a Sept. 2018 letter to @SecNielsen and will continue working to prevent this. https://t.co/S4OHQ7FozW In the three years since the #ParisAgreement was adopted, #Trump has sold America's leadership on fighting #ClimateChange to the highest bidder, pulling us out of the initiative and gutting environmental safeguards. Still, we'll keep fighting for a cleaner future. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/V0zBLzA3wu Today, @HouseCommerce held a hearing on access to SAFE kits, which help survivors of rape and sexual assault get the care they need &amp; preserve evidence for law enforcement. We need to ensure more people receive these exams, &amp; we must renew #VAWA, which can help achieve this goal. https://t.co/RmRm7qrRjp My @ProChoiceCaucus Co-Chair, @RepBarbaraLee, and I are proud to author this letter opposing #Trump's cruel changes to the #PublicCharge rule that could rip away reproductive health care from many. This a right we must defend for every woman -- regardless of immigration status. https://t.co/nIRfXST6K9 .@HouseGOP needs to follow the Constitution, which clearly grants Congress the power to authorize military force. Instead, they are seeking to block @RepRoKhanna's resolution I've cosponsored that ends our unauthorized support for the war in Yemen. They should be ashamed. https://t.co/ngLameeNEE RT @RepJoeKennedy: A crisis of maternal mortality —particularly one entrenched and exacerbated along racial lines — is unacceptable in the… By helping to bring biosimilar #insulin to market, @US_FDA has taken a huge step to achieve relief for people with #diabetes. Through my investigation into rising #insulin costs, I called for this action and commend @SGottliebFDA for his follow through. https://t.co/2Xvz4wyolL https://t.co/s9M3EGhOVz Westerners understand the importance of access to clean water. That’s why I’ve consistently opposed efforts to limit Clean Water Act protections. This move will harm ecosystems, communities, and our economy, and I'll work to hold @EPA accountable for it. https://t.co/tqKHmNPL1f Today the House unanimously passed H.R. 1318, my bipartisan bill with @HerreraBeutler that tackles the troubling rise of maternal mortality in the United States. Thanks to my House colleagues for recognizing the need for action on this public health crisis. Let's make it law. https://t.co/ZzGzAE03P4 I joined my fellow congressional Democrats from Colorado in sending a letter to @DHSgov opposing proposed changes to the #PublicCharge rule. If adopted, it would shut the door to the American dream for families across Colorado and around the world. https://t.co/BT0pVLNQYh https://t.co/CwLeI7QLZq RT @RepDianaDeGette: The #ACA has helped ensure the right to health care for millions of Americans. This #OpenEnrollment season, you and yo… This is tragic. Not long ago, the U.S. was a global leader in the fight against #ClimateChange. Now, we are joining Russia and Saudi Arabia and opposing the rest of the world in understanding the urgent threats we face. https://t.co/qbORD3ltHQ Pleased that the Supreme Court is declining to hear this case, which is part of the ongoing assault on women, low-income Americans and the health care provider that is often their only lifeline, @PPFA. We must end this dangerous witch hunt. https://t.co/Cn7Gqmg6m3 A big thank you to members of @sunrisemvmt for stopping by my DC office this morning. They talked with my staff about the best ways to #ActOnClimate in the new Congress and beyond. I'm proud to have them as partners in tackling this moral imperative of our time. Proud to unveil bipartisan draft legislation that helps improve the way @FDA approves and regulates diagnostic tests. As we modernize ways to fight diseases, we need a new regulatory framework to match improvements in diagnostics medicine.

Lack of oversight from @HouseGOP allowed this agency to steer far from its mission, but now the party's over. https://t.co/6CxWcXLOFD Meanwhile, #Trump takes us even further from this objective in his quest to protect polluters and erase @POTUS44's efforts to fight #ClimateChange. This #coal proposal is the latest in a long list of actions that harm our environment and our communities. https://t.co/AqtDD1QOvV Coloradans have spoken loud and clear: #NetNeutrality must be restored to ensure an equal playing field online. We must keep pushing for 218 signatures on the discharge petition to force a vote in the House on reinstating these protections by the end of the year! https://t.co/NDFQHB3vKt This terrifying chart reveals an even scarier truth -- we're moving in the wrong direction in the fight to stop the devastating effects of #ClimateChange. As global citizens, we must reduce carbon emissions together or collectively suffer the consequences. https://t.co/l9k8ckAr0Y https://t.co/P7o9ltJxU1 Congratulations to Denver native, @I_CU_Boy, on this well-deserved distinction! From one @denversouthhigh alum to another — thanks for making our community proud and contributing to the ongoing legacy of the @Broncos. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/StrraP4Eje “In our new majority, we will continue to fight for every woman’s right to freely access reproductive health care. The Trump admin. has made numerous attempts to throw up ideologically-driven road blocks to women’s health care, and we will stand up to every one of those attempts” https://t.co/VPHDGVXpcq The #ACA has helped ensure the right to health care for millions of Americans. This #OpenEnrollment season, you and your family can also #GetCovered by signing up for quality coverage through this landmark law.

On this #AAPI day of action, we must say #NoToPublicCharge to protect all who would be harmed by this misguided effort. The #LWCF has been instrumental in preserving our public lands, but its future is in jeopardy since its funding lapsed in October. Congress must reauthorize this program before the end of the year to ensure continued protection and enhancement of these important spaces. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/lRVRrvUq7K We've made a lot of progress in the global effort to #EndAIDS, but we're not there yet. On #WorldAIDSDay, let's recommit to this fight by continuing to support programs such as PEPFAR while also working to reduce stigma.

I’m praying for members of the Bush family as they mourn the loss of George and Barbara this year. In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including my work to fight #ClimateChange, oppose the #Trump administration's heavy-handed actions at the border, restore our democracy in the new Congress, and encourage Coloradans to #GetCovered. https://t.co/bVgvcjgWqR The National Climate Assessment warns that #ClimateChange will wreak havoc on Colorado's water supply, affecting everything from agriculture to winter sports to our local breweries. Whether #Trump believes it or not, the findings are clear: we must #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/6wcMmmQsVL #Trump's attempt to bury the National Climate Assessment can't hide the facts: The #climate crisis is also a public health crisis that could cost us precious lives and billions of dollars. Keep spreading the word -- our future depends on it. https://t.co/CF2WGdfgqa Colorado's outdoor economy could be decimated by #ClimateChange, according to the National Climate Assessment. I introduced a bipartisan resolution calling for action on climate change because we have to protect outdoor recreation and all of its benefits. https://t.co/IPzeNIdsqM https://t.co/JAzNyvi9Tf Though #Trump tried to bury the National Climate Assessment, we will keep pushing to highlight the report's dire warnings about the effects of #ClimateChange. They are happening now and harming us all, especially the most vulnerable -- as this graphic from the report makes clear. https://t.co/LpHippC6Se A week ago, the National Climate Assessment was released, detailing the dramatic and damaging effects of #ClimateChange now and in the future. We can't let this groundbreaking report fade into the news cycle; its alarming findings are too critical to ignore. #ClimateFriday This hack makes last year's massive #Equifax data breach look like child's play. Apparently none of us can count on the security of our private information, and it's downright scary. As Co-Chair of the Privacy Caucus, I'll keep working to get answers and prevent future breaches. https://t.co/bw6z16B2RD This change attacks core pillars of the #ACA that help Americans with pre-existing conditions secure health insurance. If we don't stop this sabotage, we could return to the dark days when many were denied coverage. This is not empowering consumers. https://t.co/Tjq1VSMa1P We must fight to secure a vote in the House to restore #NetNeutrality. A free and open internet helps provide greater knowledge, freedom of speech and economic opportunity for Coloradans and all Americans. We can't give up until these protections are reinstated. https://t.co/8QRJnqqM1J The National Climate Assessment warns that #ClimateChange will wreak havoc on Colorado's water supply, affecting everything from agriculture to winter sports to our local breweries. Whether #Trump believes it or not, the findings are clear: we must #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/caLrPwQ08Y .@BetsyDeVosED is wrong to propose changes to #TitleIX that make it harder for sexual assault survivors to come forward. My colleagues and I challenged this irresponsible move in a letter sent to her today. We can't deny victims the chance to seek justice. https://t.co/hKI1owotpr The 115th Congress is drawing to a close, and time's running out to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality. We need 218 votes on the discharge petition I signed to force a vote on this priority and save the free and open internet. Be sure to spread the word today! https://t.co/UlI9KhR7hK We need answers about how officials are determining when separation is necessary for the child’s safety. I demanded info from @SecNielsen in an earlier letter and will ensure @HouseDemocrats use our power in the majority to shine a light on these actions. https://t.co/qRnE1MKj7u I implore you to read this article, which highlights the ongoing crisis at our border. Though the Zero Tolerance policy officially ended in June, it appears the #Trump admin. is now using dubious claims to justify a continued effort to separate families. https://t.co/xpG4J9ktnt #Trump's attempt to bury the National Climate Assessment can't hide the facts: The #climate crisis is also a public health crisis that could cost us precious lives and billions of dollars.

What remains is a patchwork of state-level regulations that are harming the west. https://t.co/sHApwPwbcW #ClimateChange already threatens us all, and #Trump's willful ignorance of its effects could cause even more devastation. I'd say "shame on him," but he is incapable of feeling that emotion. https://t.co/uSHU7v5Y9C Though #Trump tried to bury the National Climate Assessment, we will keep pushing to highlight the report's dire warnings about the effects of #ClimateChange. They are happening now and harming us all, especially the most vulnerable -- as this graphic from the report makes clear. https://t.co/S28KEx4IN4 We must hold this administration accountable for every action it has taken to advance its reckless, xenophobic agenda that strips people of their humanity and dignity. This can't be who we are as a nation. We must be better than this. 
My statement: https://t.co/M9cT5lVbBb This, coupled with the #Trump administration's recent actions authorizing U.S. troops stationed there to use lethal force if necessary, represents another step in the ongoing militarization of our border that threatens to harm even more innocent people. https://t.co/zv8dmFLy8G Federal agents' use of tear gas on innocent civilians, many of them children, at our southern border is a shocking and heavy-handed use of force that we must condemn and heavily scrutinize. RT @RepSarbanes: On Day 1, Democrats will deliver something real for all Americans – the most ambitious set of democracy reforms in a gener… The #Trump Admin. cynically tried to hide the most recent National Climate Assessment, waiting to release it during the holiday weekend. So help spread the serious conclusions from experts across the federal gov't and share their work that Trump is afraid for people to see. https://t.co/rcIBxjYl02 Words can't express how grateful I am to represent the community where I've spent my life, advocating for friends, family, neighbors and our shared values in Congress.

These Coloradans, and those who assist them, deserve our full support this holiday season and year-round. https://t.co/wyZFCFmp1q $80 million of your tax dollars was used to implement a cruel, inhumane and completely hapless effort to separate innocent children from their parents. If that doesn't make your blood boil, then nothing will. #DemHouseMajorityIsComing https://t.co/gPrewieEtJ As families and friends gather together for Thanksgiving, please heed this important warning from @CDCgov and keep #romaine lettuce off of the menu. https://t.co/fR7HWQ2PxZ #Trans people are facing horrific levels of discrimination, hatred and violence.
