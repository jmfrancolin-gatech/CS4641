Provisions of this bill were included on Democrats‚Äô Violence Against Women Act reauthorization last year, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure this year is no different. I want to thank the hardworking, passionate advocates at @NCADV, @ndvh, @amprog, @YWCAUSA, and @WithoutViolence who continue to put this issue in the spotlight. https://t.co/vnMFwiJdsR Stalking is often the first step in an escalating pattern of criminality that leads to violence. 76% of women who were murdered by an intimate partner were first stalked. Having the ability to prevent a stalker from purchasing a weapon before they become violent is critical. In addition, too many people are victims of intimate partner violence, and right now, the definition of intimate partner doesn‚Äôt include dating partners. This legislation changes that definition to include dating partners. There are dangerous loopholes that leave victims of domestic violence and stalking unprotected by law. Too many women are killed because their abusers are allowed to possess firearms under a temporary restraining order during the period of time they are most likely to lash out. Today I am proud to reintroduce the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act. When the system fails, and perpetrators of abuse slip through the cracks and escalate their violence, it's our moral responsibility to close loopholes &amp; save the lives of potential victims.

We want to open up the government and have an adult conversation about border security and immigration reform. Sen. McConnell has to stop enabling the President's temper tantrum, and Trump needs to understand that a shutdown isn't the answer. https://t.co/CkiRAkiiyL Hundreds of thousands federal workers, contractors, and their families are suffering because the President is holding the country hostage for his wall.

Now thousands of men and women in uniform who defend our shores each day from real threats will suffer too. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/zkRxe6iEh1 Maintaining a sustained troop presence on the border -- a mission using more personnel than in Iraq or Syria -- is a waste of resources. This is clearly part of Trump's ruse to create a fake emergency on the border, and he shouldn't use servicemembers as stand-ins for his wall. This dubious deployment kept thousands of servicemembers away from home over the holidays. The National Guard has been on the border since the spring, and now active-duty soldiers will be there for another 8 months, undermining our readiness and troop morale. https://t.co/DmAyVguROX The national security implications of small businesses in my district &amp; across the country no longer being able to do business with agencies such as NASA are significant. The President must reopen government, or continue risking our national security.

https://t.co/Yff6zZrYMI Today I spoke with dozens of federal contractors who supply critical systems to agencies like NASA. These firms provide important support to the space agency and our national security, and are already having to consider layoffs because of the #TrumpShutdown. Red flag laws work, and they are one of many common-sense gun safety measures we enact today that will save lives. We can and will do more to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/FFdBgIA81c Together, we will strengthen our defense industrial base, bolster our workforce, create more opportunities for small businesses, and prepare more young people for good-paying careers. I want to thank @UnderSecArmy for making these issues a priority and for speaking to us today. https://t.co/iJgtTWXNOK Today's inaugural meeting of the Maryland Defense and Aerospace Consortium marked the beginning of our partnership to strengthen our national security, and bring more economic opportunity to the D.C. region‚Äôs.

In order to solve the challenges we have in the defense industrial base, we must work together to bolster our workforce and modernize our military. This event will launch our efforts. Tomorrow, I‚Äôm holding the inaugural Maryland Defense and Aerospace Consortium to bring together leaders from DoD, the defense industry, universities, and career &amp; technical education orgs. 

The DC region can and should be an innovation hub for the aerospace and defense industry. https://t.co/DWSyIFd8w6 How can anyone justify a vote against a bipartisan bill -- one that received unanimous support in the Senate -- to open up the government and end the suffering that hundreds of thousands of Americans are now going through as a result of the President's inability to govern. https://t.co/1Ok2abf2hP The longest government shutdown in our history, and it‚Äôs absolutely shameful. Trump must reopen the government ‚Äî Democrats have voted numerous times to do so. 

I‚Äôll be on @amjoyshow to discuss. Trump can‚Äôt continue to hold federal workers and contractors hostage for the wall. Q: Cant you just give Trump his wall and end the shutdown?

A: If we do that, what‚Äôs to stop him from holding the government hostage the next time Republicans want to defund food assistance? Today it's for the wall, tomorrow it's cuts to programs important to you and your family. ‚ÄúI work at EPA. We need to shame the President by showing him what the effects are of his shutdown.‚Äù

I agree ‚Äî our airports our less safe, law enforcement agencies aren‚Äôt getting paid, and federal workers &amp; contractors are suffering. It‚Äôs unconscionable. #TrumpShutdown ‚ÄúMy husband is an interior employee. Thank you for holding strong against the President.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am proud to work for the Federal government at the SEC. I have 36 years of experience.‚Äù

Thanks to you and your families for your service. Keep holding strong and we‚Äôll get through this. Now that the President can't get his way, he wants to declare a national emergency and take funding used to rebuild communities of color in Puerto Rico and Houston, TX to  build a wall that he uses to demonize other people of color. #ShutdownTownHall #TrumpShutdown ‚ÄúCan the President just start building the wall if he declares an emergency?‚Äù

No he cannot. We will fight it in Congress and in the courts, but it will be an uphill battle. He wants to declare a manufactured emergency because as he said, he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt make a deal.‚Äù #ShutdownTownHall ‚ÄúWhat should federal workers do while we wait?‚Äù

Take care of yourself and your family. We need your passion for public service so please continue to serve, understanding it can be difficult when we have a President who makes it his mission to undermine civil servants. Constituent and employee from @CommerceGov: ‚ÄúWe are at an impasse. Is it likely that Congress could override a veto with 2/3 vote?‚Äù

Sen. McConnell must bring these spending bills to the floor. Let the President veto it or not, and we‚Äôll do the job Congress is meant to do. ‚ÄúHow long is this going to last?‚Äù

The ball is in the President‚Äôs court. Republicans &amp; Democrats want to open the government, but Trump reneged on the deal he made and now refuses to negotiate. The President could end this at any point. #ShutdownTownHall My constituents appreciate that Democrats led the charge to make sure every family is made whole at the end of this shutdown. 

But this promise doesn‚Äôt help them meet their immediate needs. They need their pay now. #ShutdownTownHall Trump has made this the longest shutdown in our history. It's unacceptable, and I'm working to support my constituents during this crisis. They‚Äôre struggling to pay their bills, afford their prescriptions or even stay in their homes. 

This shutdown must end. #ShutdownTownHall https://t.co/xlNRAPKrJe RT @TheBeatWithAri: "The only crisis that exists, Ari, is the crisis in the Oval Office, we've got a President who's abusing power"

Watch: https://t.co/x0Nz6gZf4j Trump is holding the government hostage to fund a wall Americans have opposed ever since it was first used as an applause line in a speech that deemed an entire nation of people ‚Äòrapists‚Äô and ‚Äòcriminals.'
