It was heartbreaking to hear their stories and how so many folks in Sacramento County are needlessly being harmed. I’ve had the privilege of recently meeting with Air Traffic Controllers, members of the Coast Guard, Small Business Administration employees, and others who’ve been hurt by this irresponsible shutdown. https://t.co/ZccLORKXI6 I voted three more times this week to end the government shutdown.

Proud to stand with @PPFA and my congressional colleagues to pushback against the Trump Administration’s attacks on women’s health care. https://t.co/CHd7Jzk5X9 We must end this government shutdown immediately. Families shouldn’t have their tax refunds put at risk over needless political posturing. https://t.co/HUcMd1APQF We must protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Are you being harmed by the shutdown?

Helping others was a wonderful way to honor the working men and women of this country. https://t.co/SLflHbRmmY 55 years ago today the Klu Klux Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. Let us remember the 4 bright young girls who tragically lost their lives – Addie, Denise, Carole, and Cynthia. Bigotry &amp; hate have no place in America &amp; we must speak out against it. https://t.co/CkB8ketM0U Pres. Trump is pushing to gut the Affordable Care Act – which would kick millions off their insurance &amp; drive up costs. This is wrong- we need to fix what isn’t working &amp; make it better. See my Prescription to Protect Our Care for real solutions: https://t.co/4mr5OrerwS https://t.co/rmcW1QbB5R The Violence Against Women Act became law 24 years ago today. One of my first acts in Congress was voting to reauthorize the law, making it stronger and providing more resources to stop violence. No woman or family should have to live in the shadow of abuse. https://t.co/rtsbVusdfe The Violence Against Women Act became law 24 years ago today. No woman or family should have to live in fear or abuse. That’s why I’ve been a strong champion of this law – voting to reauthorize and strengthen it, and pushing to fund its programs. https://t.co/xWhMOO2gBO 26 years ago today, Dr. Mae Jemison became the first African American woman to go into space. As the Ranking Member of the Space Subcommittee, I continue to be inspired by her pioneering work and by what an incredible role model she is for all Americans. https://t.co/pDg1GFYuYL May we never forget those who were lost 17 years ago. My thoughts continue to be with the victims’ families and our brave firefighters, police, first responders, and military. #NeverForget https://t.co/tJMfBiw10y September is National Suicide Prevention Month.

The HERO Act encourages mental health awareness and provides more resources for police, fire, &amp; emergency personnel. This is a commonsense bill that can make a huge difference. Today we unveiled the Helping Emergency Responders Overcome (HERO) Act.

Thank you to Police Chief Hahn, Fire Chief Johnson, Fire Chief McLaughlin, and IAFF Metro VP Jamison for attending today. https://t.co/iOVAozPPOc Great news: My amendment to help college students passed the House. This will ensure students who take loans are given info on income-based repayment options &amp; estimates of monthly payments based on anticipated career. Will help ensure students aren’t caught off guard w/ debt. https://t.co/yAKFzkHXe1 As a doctor, I strongly believe a woman’s health care decisions are between her and her doctor. A woman’s right to make her own health decisions is one of the most personal individual liberties. https://t.co/yJ7rhaHclL We know that Roe v. Wade continues to be in serious jeopardy. We must double down to protect a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. https://t.co/co8U0O0Mqx The best way to celebrate #LaborDay is to push solutions that help workers get higher wages: rebuild our infrastructure, invest in education, and paid family leave. The last thing workers need are huge tax giveaways to billionaires and special interests at their expense. https://t.co/fj7YSkXna7 Great to start this #LaborDay at Sacramento Loaves &amp; Fishes. Thank you to all who came out today! https://t.co/nRzyvfDlPk On this International Overdose Awareness Day, we’re reminded of how the opioid crisis is continuing to take thousands of our loved ones each year. Please do your part to prevent addiction and see where you can drop off your unused or expired prescriptions: https://t.co/8C8IESyVju Yesterday I spoke with dozens of @UCDavis Medical Students. Their biggest concern was college affordability.

We need to help students refinance their loans, support working students, and update Pell Grants for the 21st century. https://t.co/X7k2Ody8hn Thank you to the students at @UCDavis Medical School for a great talk about the future of medicine! It was great to be back in the classroom. https://t.co/WVEm89UwKn 55 years ago today, Martin Luther King made his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. May we never forget what makes America truly great and continue pushing for the full equality of every American. https://t.co/ZgLiJ6mNh0 My staff will be at the Sylvan Oaks library tomorrow from 10:00 AM to noon to help you with backlogged veterans' benefits, stalled tax refunds, and much more. RSVP: https://t.co/xyBsAxkVER Today is a very sad day. This nation has lost a true American hero. Please keep the McCain family in your prayers. https://t.co/nlUTgIKr4L My thoughts and best wishes are with Senator McCain and his family today, a true American hero. Can you find old or expired prescription drugs in your medicine cabinet? Chances are someone else could stumble onto them just as easily. Help address the opioid epidemic and see where you can drop them off: https://t.co/0axOi6dphx As a doctor, I know gutting the Affordable Care Act would kick millions off their health care &amp; drive up costs. No one should have to worry an unexpected medical bill threatening their future. Read my plan to fix what isn’t working and make it better here: https://t.co/4mr5OrerwS https://t.co/sHuJ1oifAg 98 years ago today, women were guaranteed the right to vote with the 19th Amendment. Although we’ve made progress, there is still much more work to be done to reach true equality. Gender should never be a barrier to anyone’s success. https://t.co/HTHNGIKN7T I oppose Delta tunnels because it’s a flawed plan that’s too expensive. We shouldn’t prioritize one side of Delta over the other. We need a comprehensive plan for CA water problems that addresses our state’s challenges &amp; reflects needs of all residents. 
https://t.co/7D5i59kUF0 One year ago I voted for the biggest update to GI Bill in 10 years – which is now law. This landmark legislation will help countless veterans by removing time limits to claim benefits. We owe our veterans nothing less than our full and unwavering support. https://t.co/liZxPbZNwx Like so many of you, I’m very concerned about the wildfires burning in CA. Sent out an email update with resources to help those who may be affected, including air quality and fire prevention information. See it here &amp; feel free to please pass it along: https://t.co/4HHTHRetgq President Trump wants to gut the Affordable Care Act and kick millions of people off their insurance. That’s wrong. We need to fix what isn’t working and make it better. You can read my plan to improve the ACA here, a Prescription to Protect Our Care: https://t.co/4mr5OrerwS https://t.co/KiZFJFEOlo My thoughts are with the family of Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett, who  tragically lost his life while battling the Medocino Complex Fire. Our heroic firefighters are doing an incredible job keeping our communities safe and we owe them our full support. https://t.co/x3WlDfaGvd On this day in 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law. We need to honor this bedrock promise to our seniors – we shouldn’t cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for a huge tax giveaway for billionaires. https://t.co/hSf7FAH6p3 Need help? My staff will be at the Franklin library on Tuesday from 10:00 AM to noon to help you with backlogged veterans' benefits, Social Security issues, stalled tax refunds, and much more. Learn more and RSVP: https://t.co/GdqsJEc1Bj President Trump is trying to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

California has fought for years to reduce our emissions to improve public health, save consumers money, and address climate change.

This will hurt California's economy and the planet. It's short-sighted and wrong.
