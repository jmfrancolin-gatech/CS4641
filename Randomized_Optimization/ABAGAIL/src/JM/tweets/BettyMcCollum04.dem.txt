I’m requesting an official opinion from the Congressional watchdog agency on the legality of his actions during the #TrumpShutdown.

This is known as the “pick and stick rule.” Pick one and stick to it. https://t.co/y5YI5AvKTm I have serious questions about Acting Sec. Bernhardt’s decision to use visitor fees to keep some national parks open during the shutdown. These funds are not a slush fund for the Administration to use whenever and however it wants.

As appropriators, we take this role seriously to ensure taxpayer dollars are handled properly. https://t.co/UtcFzLtdAA National park visitor fees are for a very specific use – long-term capital improvement projects.

I’m looking forward to working with your administration as you build #OneMinnesota. Thank you to @GovMarkDayton for your years of dedicated public service as the Governor of Minnesota. Governor Dayton truly left Minnesota better off for our children and grandchildren. Thank you, Mark! Today is day 17 of the #TrumpShutdown. Federal employees like TSA agents &amp; air traffic controllers are working without pay to keep our nation safe. @realDonaldTrump needs to take responsibility for the impact of his shutdown and end it immediately. .@HouseDemocrats are working hard to bring the #TrumpShutdown to an end and get our country moving again. I’m proud to co-sponsor the #ForThePeople Act – a set of reforms to strengthen our democracy and return political power to the people. https://t.co/akmypi3FWA RT @esmemurphy: .@wcco 10:30am as the Government shutdown drags on two influential members of Congress @BettyMcCollum04 @RepTomEmmer will b… Miss the December 15th deadline to enroll in @MNsure?

Thousands of federal employees are going w/o pay during the #TrumpShutdown, and the president is doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. This is outrageous. I stand w/ @RepMikeQuigley in calling on the White House to rescind this action. https://t.co/Gc8XK68iHA This was a truly historic week in U.S. history – the House of Representatives ushered in its most diverse freshman class, including 36 new women. It is with great pride that I serve alongside these dedicated public servants. Now, let’s get to work! https://t.co/i4n2jzOGku Proud to cosponsor H.R. 1. @HouseDemocrats will end the #CultureOfCorruption and build a democracy that works for every American. https://t.co/nbjhTDTMLh Despite last night’s House vote to reopen the gov't, the #TrumpShutdown is now two weeks old. Smithsonian museums are closed. EPA inspections of many polluted sites have ceased. And federal workers still don’t know when their next paycheck might arrive. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/6hVMXJ8hES RT @esmemurphy: .@wcco Sun10:30am as Gov shutdown continues 2 powerful members of Congress are live in studio:Democrat @BettyMcCollum04  a… Congress has a responsibility to fund the gov't and end the #TrumpShutdown. We’re about to vote on funding legislation that has already received overwhelming Republican support in the Senate. Any Republican opposition to this is a vote against their own legislation. Congratulations to Congressman Jim Langevin on being the first Speaker pro tempore on day one of the 116th Congress! Jim and I began serving in Congress the same year, and I am thrilled to see him presiding on the first day of the new Democratic majority. Proud to vote for my colleague @NancyPelosi as Speaker of the House. Nancy’s tenacity and commitment to serving the people will move our country forward. Under her leadership, @HouseDemocrats are ready to end the #TrumpShutdown and get to work. On my way to the House Floor to get to work in the 116th Congress! https://t.co/P2k2JkvomU Tomorrow, the new Democratic House will take rapid action to reopen all government services, ensure federal workers receive their hard-earned paychecks, and restore certainty to the American people. @HouseDemocrats are ready to hit the ground running and work #ForThePeople The #TrumpShutdown has cut off funding for gov't services for nearly 1.9 million Native Americans – putting their health and safety at risk. Congress must act quickly to ensure that our Native brothers and sisters have access to the resources they need: https://t.co/Z0IK5c8nW9 My heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of Lance Cpl. Riley S. Kuznia. https://t.co/6bC9uwLviJ .@realDonaldTrump, I am watching your White House monologue...please stop talking!  The federal government is partially shutdown and 800,000 federal employees are not being paid.  Please stop the bragging, the bluster, the nonsense and get to work opening the government! Enough! The #TrumpShutdown is wreaking havoc on our National Parks. Without visitor services or park rangers to protect our public lands, conditions are seriously deteriorating. Democrats will act swiftly to pass bills to bring this needless shutdown to an end. https://t.co/CklrOSM3Jk https://t.co/DLuICttBQS Have questions about the #TrumpShutdown and how it will affect your daily life? Read this helpful factsheet that addresses the most frequently asked questions about the shutdown: https://t.co/rFXDflpTo5 Making it easier for coal-fired plants to poison our air with mercury is a betrayal of @EPA mission to protect human health &amp; safety. The acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, former coal lobbyist, gives big win to big coal. American people get poison. https://t.co/E4bK1Lh6uS https://t.co/UBeSVDHcKZ FACT: This is the 3rd #TrumpShutdown this year under a Republican controlled House, Senate, and White House. @HouseDemocrats remain committed to stopping this dysfunction and getting our government back on track when we take the House in January. Democrats have offered three funding options for strong, sensible, and effective border security that don’t include Pres. Trump’s ineffective &amp; expensive border wall. Republicans have the power AND responsibility to end the #TrumpShutdown and should do so immediately. RT @NancyPelosi: Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the S… .@realDonaldTrump has made it clear that he will prioritize his bigoted, wasteful, &amp; ineffective border wall over anything – even the livelihoods of federal employees &amp; the American people. Democrats in Congress are committed to fully fund the government &amp; avoid a  #TrumpShutdown I just spoke on the House floor about @realDonaldTrump’s latest tantrum threatening to shutdown the govt over his wasteful border wall. @HouseGOP leadership needs to stand up to the President and pass a responsible spending bill that keeps the govt open. #TrumpShutdown Secretary of Defense Mattis is right, America can only lead in the world by maintaining strong and respectful partnerships with our friends and allies. His resignation from the administration gives me great concern, and is a serious blow to American leadership in the world. Mere days after Congress passed the bipartisan Farm Bill @realDonaldTrump has made it his mission to restrict access to vital food assistance programs like SNAP. This decision will hurt Minnesota families and children who depend on SNAP. https://t.co/zHiklJPfXe I’m in DC with my Democratic &amp; Republican colleagues ready to pass the Senate bill funding the federal government. Now, we hear @realDonaldTrump wants a shutdown for Christmas. Time for Congress to fund the government and override this failed president's veto. #TrumpShutdown The Unites States has a moral and legal responsibility to live up to our treaty obligations to tribal nations, and #USCCRReports clearly shows we are failing. I’m committed to leading Democrats in fighting for more funding for Native health, education, safety, and other needs. https://t.co/8CxxeJUIl2 In my 6 years as Native American Caucus Co-Chair, I’ve been honored to work with our nation's tribal leaders. Now I’m thrilled to support a shift in Caucus leadership to Reps-elect Haaland &amp; Davids, the first Native women in Congress. Full statement: https://t.co/6cUiHm9Apv https://t.co/9Oo0OzeWsu I am returning to DC today to prevent President Trump from shutting down the federal government. No $5 billion for wasteful wall. Time to say goodbye to the GOP controlled House and welcome responsible leadership in 2019 with Democrats in control. https://t.co/rVCBBVWXDD Congratulations to Joan Gabel on her appointment as the first female president of the University of Minnesota! I look forward to the innovative leadership she will bring to our state’s flagship university. https://t.co/78IiWZGAuR Our public lands are not up for grabs — whether it’s to a billionaire NFL team owner, fossil fuel companies, or any other private entity.

A majority of Americans do not support a wall, let alone a shutdown. Pres. Trump &amp; the GOP need to do their jobs &amp; fund the government NOW. Happy 382nd birthday to the @NationalGuard! Thank you to all the brave citizen Soldiers and Airmen who have committed to serve our nation, both here and abroad @MNNationalGuard The House just passed a resolution calling on Burma to release imprisoned journalists Wa Lone &amp; Kyaw Soe Oo, who were investigating the genocide of the Rohingya people. The US must not accept human rights violations anywhere, and these journalists should be released immediately. The oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic Ocean has declined by a shocking 95% since 1985. Without protective sea ice, ocean warming will dangerously accelerate.  We must act now to combat #ClimateChange and #SaveTheArctic https://t.co/WgfQENYBXp Today I voted for the Farm Bill. After months of delays, Congress finally passed a bill that preserves the integrity of SNAP, provides certainty for family farmers, &amp; protects bedrock conservation laws. Thanks to my colleague, Rep. Collin Peterson, for his hard work &amp; leadership! Congressional leaders are working to slip language into a must-pass spending bill that criminalizes politically motivated boycotts against Israel. The Israel Anti-Boycott Act violates our right to free speech. @ACLU is fighting to protect it. https://t.co/J2q5GLKIoF Another attack by @realDonaldTrump on our clean air and clean water.  

Removing protections that keep pollution out of our nation's streams and wetlands endangers American’s drinking water.
