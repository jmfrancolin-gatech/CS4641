The officers informed the students that they would release dogs on them. Despite the president of the university’s wishes, the students organized a peaceful walk to pray for the students of Tougaloo who were arrested for participating in a demonstration to integrate the city library in Jackson, MS.  At the time the city’s library was “whites only.” Celestine King participated in the first demonstration to end segregation in the Jackson State University’s history.  She was a student at the university during the 1960s. https://t.co/VeqSVdgQWI Happy Birthday @RepBonnie!

Also, he remained the only African- American until 1976 and was repeated reelected until 2003. In 2004, he became the first African-American to have a Mississippi State building named after him. Mr. Clark and the Freedom Democratic Party is responsible for having registered thousands of black voters for the first time after reconstruction.  Robert G. Clark was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1967. In 1963, he began working to register and educate voters. He became a candidate in the Freedom Democratic Party in 1967 because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Clark received his bachelor’s degree from @JacksonStateU and his Masters in Administration and Education Services from Michigan State University.  His Ph.D. was almost completed before he decided to devote his time to pursue politics. Robert G. Clark Jr. impacted the lives of many during his tenure as a teacher in Holmes County, MS. His family was trailblazers in economic development because they became landowners immediately following the American Civil War. https://t.co/kaOxF4jtEp It was an honor to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore today.

Furthermore, she gained national attention by traveling across the country to promote the construction of low-income housing. During her time participating in the Civil Rights Movement, she was jailed over 70 times because of her role in civil rights protests and other actions.
She was elected mayor of Mayersville, MS in 1976, making her the first female African-American mayor in Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member of the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. In late August, she and 67 other elected Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention. She first got involved in the Civil Rights Movement in June 1964, when two activists from SNCC came to Mayersville.  After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in the summer of 1964 and hearing her experiences in the Civil Rights Movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. Unita Zelma Blackwell is a civil rights activist.  Blackwell was a project director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped organize voter drives for African Americans across Mississippi. https://t.co/UswZmucDYY This year for Black History Month, I will be highlighting unknown civil rights heroes of Mississippi.

In a state that ranks 50th among the states in the percent of children who are poor, Ms. Slaughter-Harvey continues to direct her personal and professional efforts to assist minority and poor youth through the Slaughter Memorial Foundation. She filed a desegregation suit against the highway patrol, which resulted in the hiring of African American highway patrolmen. Ms. Slaughter-Harvey’s dedication to civil rights did not end with the struggles of the ‘60s and ‘70s. Slaughter-Harvey was inspired by the brutal death of Medgar Evers, whom she met as a student at @TougalooCollege. After graduating from law school, she represented the families of the 2 students who were brutalized and killed by highway patrolmen in 1970 at @JacksonStateU. Constance Slaughter-Harvey is a civil rights icon in Mississippi. She was the first African-American judge in Mississippi and the first African American female to graduate from @olemisslaw. https://t.co/46Z7xDWYbd RT @HouseDemocrats: The unnecessary #TrumpShutdown was a painful reminder that many Americans live paycheck to paycheck. @HouseDemocrats be… RT @HouseDemocrats: #BecauseOfThem more Americans can see themselves in today’s leaders.
