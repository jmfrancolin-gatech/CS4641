Our prayers are with Congresswoman Dingell and the entire Dingell family. 

Congressman Dingell’s memory and public service will not be forgotten by all the lives he touched. https://t.co/W9Zx3kjLw7 RT @HouseVetAffairs: Welcome @RepJackBergman, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. https://t.co/SnDLYKzXGZ Instead of working towards a compromise to open the government and secure our border, the Speaker is canceling session and barring @POTUS from delivering the State of the Union address at the Capitol. This is nothing short of political theater. Our constituents deserve better! Democrat leadership in the House would do well to focus as much energy on opening the government as they are on keeping @realDonaldTrump from delivering his State of the Union address. There’s only one thing I could’ve possibly been explaining to @OANN here. #PureMichigan #Mi01 https://t.co/BYBvptDLt4 Looking forward to continuing to serve the Veterans of #Mi01 and the nation as a member of @HouseVetAffairs. https://t.co/PGMmRL0aUf The life of Martin Luther King, Jr., changed and inspired the world. His dedication to equality, liberty, and justice has left an indelible mark on our nation. 

On this #MLKDay of Service I was proud to join with @AmeriCorps at the Reining Liberty Ranch to help #GetThingsDone. https://t.co/V233Z6kAbm This weekend @realDonaldTrump put a very reasonable offer on the table to end this shutdown and secure our southern border.

https://t.co/tHSdxEJxN9 I'm honored for the distinct nomination to serve on the House Armed Services Committee. As we face uncertain times, military readiness and proper funding are essential. 

As new threats emerge, our military must remain the strongest and most lethal force in the world.

It’s time Democrats come to the table and work together to secure the border and end this shutdown. Americans sent us to Washington to solve problems – and if we can't do that, we don’t deserve to get paid. 4/ If Congress can’t do its job resulting in a shutdown, we should forfeit our pay as well. 

Last week, I cosponsored legislation with @RepRalphNorman to prohibit Congress from receiving compensation during a government shutdown. 3/ I support @POTUS in this fight for #bordersecurity because there is no greater responsibility than protecting the American people. As negotiations continue, I’ll be donating my salary to local charity organizations in #Mi01. 2/ One of the main priorities of Congress is to fund the federal government and prioritize our national security, yet Democrats are refusing to come to the negotiating table to do just that. 1/ It’s past time for Democrats to come to the table with a plan I support @POTUS call for border security. The President is only asking for support of policies that Democrats have supported and voted for just a few short years ago. We must do whatever it takes to prioritize national security and secure our borders. I look forward to working with the new Speaker to ensure the 116th Congress focuses on important issues – Veterans’ care, stronger border security, rising healthcare costs, continuing our momentum on the Soo Locks, and ensuring broadband access for rural Michiganders. I’m honored the constituents of the First District have entrusted me to serve as their Representative in the 116th Congress. It’s imperative that Congress continues the momentum of the past two years, and we work to pass constituent-centric policies. It’s time to get this bill back through the House, through the Senate, and on to @POTUS desk. https://t.co/Urwttyqf4l #Mi01 https://t.co/Dam96LCJIA Recently I had the opportunity to speak at the christening ceremony of the future USS St. Louis (LCS-19) in Marinette.

🖥 https://t.co/DTvIp21lHq https://t.co/kxkQGP1scO As we remember and reflect on the sacrifices made 74 years ago today, our nation and the world will forever be grateful for those who sacrificed all to free a continent, and rid the world of Nazi tyranny. As a kid we were always taught that service comes before self. My father was a Petty Officer Third Class in the U.S. Navy and served in the South Pacific during World War 2. We owe an immeasurable debt to those who've gone before us to secure our liberties. https://t.co/TQYzmJh8E8 Big news: @NatResources is coming to #Mi01! https://t.co/F7Lb4hSe9D It was meant to be. Great to have my friend @SteveScalise back on the field. https://t.co/qs5Xr08VBM One of the highlights of my week was having the opportunity to speak at the United Tribes of Michigan summer meeting in Petoskey to discuss legislation and policy that we are working to accomplish together. Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula are home to eight federally recognized Indian tribes. This is one of the reasons I’m honored to be the first member of Congress from Michigan’s First District to become a member of the bipartisan Native American Caucus. https://t.co/EJHLpwEh0Y Today we honor those who gave all to secure the liberties and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. Their sacrifice for the good of our nation must never be taken for granted. https://t.co/Cik6oRHUA7 Tune in at 11! https://t.co/IQsFrzmYMN Tune in to WDBC Escanaba at 8:30. I’ll be joining Craig Woerpel live to discuss the VA legislation that we’ve passed over the past several weeks. I applaud Chairman @MacTXPress for including language in the FY19 NDAA highlighting the critical role the Soo Locks play in our national security.

Thanks for capturing it, @DustinDilworth https://t.co/khVwbrxHgy As businesses throughout the U.P. and northern lower peninsula begin to see the benefits of tax reform and seek to expand operations, workforce development remains one of the biggest challenges facing businesses of all sizes. #TaxCutsandJobsAct https://t.co/xIfPvac3nh Last week while in Iron River I had the chance to tour Lake Shore Systems, Inc. to see the work they are doing for the mining and maritime industries.
