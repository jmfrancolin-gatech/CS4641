To succeed in the long run, we need a comprehensive strategy for Syria and the entire region. https://t.co/2xrHwVGYKK Director Pompeo has the experience &amp; understanding needed to reassert strong American leadership, confront complex global challenges, restore morale @StateDept &amp; ensure human rights is central to diplomacy. The Senate should move quickly to confirm this highly qualified nominee. Today, @POTUS signed into law our bipartisan #SESTA. This bill will enable Backpage and other websites to be held accountable for knowingly facilitating human trafficking, and allow victims of these horrific crimes to seek the justice they deserve. https://t.co/l3Lidlc7vg https://t.co/t82QDrI4aw Must-read by @DCTwining @IRIglobal &amp; @kwollack @NDI in @washingtonpost: "#Russia’s nefarious meddling is nothing like democracy assistance" https://t.co/MFGXlCxcG0 .@SpeakerRyan is a good man who has served the country and the people of Wisconsin with honor and distinction.

It’s a lot harder to hold it truly accountable and change its behavior. That requires a real strategy and positive trade agenda, which is why the US should rejoin the #TPP11. New sanctions send a message to #Putin &amp; his cronies that there will be a high price to pay for Russian aggression. The US must press forward w/ broader strategy to counter #Russia's malign activities. https://t.co/sLt6tAGvpc Good news from @DeptofDefense that they intend to shock test USS Gerald R Ford.
