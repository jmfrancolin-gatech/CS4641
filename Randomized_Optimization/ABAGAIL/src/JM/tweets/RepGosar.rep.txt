https://t.co/wVLWxAF7FS RT @FAIRImmigration: .@RepGosar Urges @TheJusticeDept To Investigate Source of Caravans https://t.co/sJMoPBUJtL The level of organization, logistics and coordination being depicted in reports of the most recent caravan raises serious concerns. I sent a letter to the DOJ asking for an investigation to determine the actors responsible for this invasion. https://t.co/f4PCUZmBsc My first read of the day. 

‚ÄúThe result of hundreds of ‚Äòsanctuary cities‚Äô is not just to forbid full immigration enforcement in particular jurisdictions. They also signal that U.S. immigration law, and by extension other laws, can be ignored.‚Äù https://t.co/DZ6dVhdSnq #DidYouKnow the unemployment rate in Arizona has fallen 0.6 percentage points since the election of President Trump, to a new post-recession low of 4.6 percent. https://t.co/VmwHNklPMw Couldn't agree more @LimitGovt and @Daily_Torch! Let‚Äôs stop the land grabs! The Land and Water Conservation Fund needs reformed and shouldn't be put on autopilot to the tune of nearly a billion dollars per year. https://t.co/UFOZ6urvGQ I applaud @POTUS for taking our nation‚Äôs sovereignty seriously by sending troops to protect our border. Now Congress needs to follow his lead and support legislation to #buildthewall, close loopholes and #secureourborder.  https://t.co/hL5Vtl7Seq #DidYouKnow household median income in Arizona has grown substantially increasing over 7 percent between 2016 and 2017, to $61,125. #BetterOffNow https://t.co/caqyPGmwqk Honored to receive an A+ rating from @NumbersUSA's. "In the 115h Congress, nobody rated higher in supporting immigration policies to protect American workers and local communities." https://t.co/20rpvrZHn2 Over the past few weeks, I've had the privilege of driving around our beautiful district to visit with small business owners, speak with local law enforcement and hear from many of you.

This is one of the many efforts I have supported in order to #secureourborder. https://t.co/yFf2Vj7CLw I had a nice visit at Eagle Motorcycle with Joe and Michelle Kuenen. Enjoyed learning how their business is expanding to serve more customers. https://t.co/sjPBQbfrSc Great turnout tonight at the Bullhead City town hall. https://t.co/iAPFE1Xn5D Looking forward to tonight's town hall in Bullhead City!

See below for details ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/nJECu6epl3 Even if all of the members of the caravan were perfect ppl, we still cannot allow for the usurpation of our sovereignty. There are thousands of ppl in the caravan, and hundreds of millions around the world who wish to come to America. Where do we draw the line? #BuildtheWall https://t.co/uTZsmdXZcd My first read of the day.
‚ÄúOpioids now kill more than fifty thousand Americas a year, ten thousand more than AIDS did at the peak of that epidemic‚Äîmore, too than gun homicides and moto-vehicle accidents.‚Äù

https://t.co/k3dZtUxX0F The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply when repelling a coordinated invasion from a foreign country.  This is a pure military function to defend the nation. #buildthewallnow #AZ04 #stoptheinvaders Bush II deployed 6,000 National Guard troops to assist on border security. #buildthewallnow #AZ04 #stoptheinvaders Obama deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to help secure the border. #buildthewallnow #AZ04 #stoptheinvaders As the number of migrants grows by the THOUSANDS it's becoming even more imperative that we secure our border at ALL cost. Since open border democrats refuse to work with Republicans to #buildthewall, it's up to our military to protect our border from the most recent invasion.
