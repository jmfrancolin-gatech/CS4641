Democrats are ready to fund smart, effective solutions for border security. The President is only ready to play games. In tonight’s #SOTU we heard a hollow pledge for unity, followed by lies and division designed to manufacture a political crisis. The President’s scripted remarks mean nothing if they are followed by a discriminatory agenda that undermines our values &amp; further divides our nation. FACT CHECK: false. https://t.co/vhrmiawwLd I’m proud to be joined at tonight’s #SOTU by Ken Krebs—a federal employee in my district who was furloughed thanks to the #TrumpShutdown.

I’m pleased that President Trump has, for now, decided to end his tantrum and sign legislation to temporarily reopen government while negotiations continue on border security issues. Trump’s shutdown of the federal government has been one of the most irresponsible chapters in American political history. His reckless demand that Congress pay ransom for his foolish border wall left 700K federal workers without pay &amp; millions more without services they rely on.

-$524.2M to upgrade our ports of entry

-$563.4M for immigration judges

-$527M for assistance to Central America The only "compromise" in President Trump's proposal was a compromise of our national values.

Steps @realDonaldTrump has taken:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ As the incoming Chairman of the Transportation &amp; Housing Subcommittee, I look forward to working with colleagues to rebuild our broken infrastructure system, promote affordable housing and community development, and conduct vigorous oversight of the Trump administration. It’s my honor to continue serving on the @AppropsDems Committee alongside a full roster of talented &amp; experienced members and under the leadership of @NitaLowey. We are prepared to make the serious investments needed to help American families, businesses, and communities thrive. The scope of the Trump administration's cruel family separation policy is much larger than initially disclosed. Every official who established this policy, lied to Congress, or helped cover up its brutality should be held accountable. https://t.co/ahw83bnyzJ #WheresMitch https://t.co/0UuUcXMZHA Rep. Steve King's recent comments are the latest in a career filled with racist and offensive rhetoric that has no place in the U.S. Congress. I'm pleased the House voted on a bipartisan basis to condemn his remarks and I join my colleagues who have called for his resignation. Today would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 90th birthday. Let us always remember his unrelenting commitment to righting injustice and recommit ourselves to his unfinished work. https://t.co/CHmhjSyVUi While the government shutdown is certainly Donald Trump's fault, 800,000 federal employees remain unpaid because of @senatemajldr's spineless refusal to put funding bills on the floor that would assuredly pass in the Senate. As I wrote in the @theobserver, the Trump admin hoped to make the Census the latest front in GOP efforts to suppress voters &amp; disenfranchise people of color. This is a major victory in preventing these efforts &amp; ensuring a free and fair process plays out. https://t.co/MuzCFziSVk https://t.co/boej0lQ9j4 You can't choose your history, but you can choose the history you honor.

Don't put it off any longer—find a plan that fits your needs AND your budget today. https://t.co/eSCAosPgXC Samuel's arrest and deportation are a shameful reminder of the heartlessness of the Trump immigration agenda, which continues to drive thousands even further into the shadows of society. https://t.co/8cSUmpOXnk Pleased to be joined by Mayor @NancyMcFarlane, @crowder4council, and my entire staff to tour Raleigh’s @dixpark, an incredibly exciting public-private partnership that will serve the entire community. https://t.co/aSXpclvk5i Wishing all those celebrating a happy and joyful #Hanukkah https://t.co/Db6yh89ke0 We mourn the death of President George H. W. Bush. He was a skilled diplomat and champion of American alliances, co-architect of a major budget agreement that improved our fiscal future, and one of the most effective modern presidents in working with both parties in the Congress. Millions of children around the world are #HIV-free thanks to the incredible work of our global health programs. This #WorldAIDSDay, Congress must recommit to #EndAIDS and one day reach an AIDS-free generation. https://t.co/SIlYpPSXHq Today is a sad day for the Durham community. Samuel Oliver-Bruno’s arrest and deportation are a failure of justice, and we are demanding answers. My full statement with @GKButterfield: https://t.co/DKRfmz00eP Allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated to guarantee the outcome of this election reflects the will of the voters. That's why we're calling on the State Board to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to certifying the election results. This afternoon, @GKButterfield, @RepAdams, and I released a statement on the North Carolina Board of Elections' bipartisan decision to delay certification of NC-09 election results.

Thomas Farr's confirmation would be an affront to impartiality, an insult to voters of color, and a threat to free &amp; fair elections for all. #StoppFarr RT @SenSchumer: I hope all of my colleagues on the Republican side take the time to study Thomas Farr's career. I believe they’ll find that… Tonight, @GKButterfield &amp; I were notified that Samuel Oliver-Bruno's petition for deferred deportation has been denied. Mr. Oliver-Bruno's treatment by the Trump admin has been a miscarriage of justice--and we're calling on @SecNielsen to immediately reverse his order of removal. https://t.co/tfknnfAkhC The images coming from our southern border of families being tear-gassed as they seek refuge from persecution, disaster, and turmoil are haunting. Plain and simple: the Trump immigration agenda is un-American and Democrats will do everything in our power to reverse it. https://t.co/HLgGDJOzmo Mr. Farr has an alarming history defending voter suppression, supporting racial/political gerrymandering, and intimidating African American voters. His record clearly demonstrates he would not only be a partial jurist, but a threat to voters everywhere. #StopFarr https://t.co/6iDF0qemcE Today, along with my colleagues, @RepAdams and @GKButterfield, I sent a letter to @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell urging the cancellation of all votes on the nomination of Thomas A. Farr for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court of Eastern NC. https://t.co/DMLqpTjzLd UPDATE: This weekend, @GKButterfield &amp; I secured a commitment from @ICEgov not deport Samuel Oliver-Bruno until his deferment claim is heard. But the circumstances of his arrest &amp; detention are unacceptable, &amp; I'm continuing to contact top DHS officials for his immediate release. This morning, Samuel Oliver-Bruno was abruptly arrested by ICE agents as he visited local immigration offices to check-in on his status.

We must confront and speak out against hate wherever it occurs. https://t.co/94uHWVzd00 🚨IMPORTANT THREAD👇 https://t.co/rjGmyB1989 As Democrats regain the majority in the House, there are many priorities we must deliver on for the American people. At the top of my list:

🇺🇸Comprehensive democracy reform

🏗 Real investment in our nation’s crumbling infrastructure

🔍 Robust oversight of Trump administration https://t.co/RngkBHH66j In our letter, we point out the severe risks posed to vulnerable populations such as children, low-income individuals, and communities of color if the Trump administration succeeds in gutting the CPP and replacing it with it's far weaker plan. Read more: https://t.co/qTT5SFyKcm Today, along with 100+ colleagues, I sent a letter to @EPAAWheeler urging him to reinstate the Clean Power Plan, which was a landmark achievement in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, and protecting the health and safety of the American people. https://t.co/uEYN3bkX0o HUD’s failure to enforce adequate property standards has left thousands of residents in dilapidated conditions &amp; more of our affordable housing stock at risk of disrepair. As the incoming THUD Appropriations Chairman, I plan to hold this administration accountable on this issue. https://t.co/ipSCRNA6MT I'm proud to continue representing N.C.’s 4th District in Congress. As we look ahead to the Democratic House majority, I am ready to resume the fight for affordable health care, an economy that works for everyone, and a democracy that empowers people over special interests. https://t.co/UwjXUj1ML6 Many people have asked me what is the first thing Democrats will do when we regain the majority. As a Vice Chair of the House Democracy Reform Task Force, I'm proud to say this is the answer. https://t.co/qrAUYNyXlB This morning the NC delegation met with @NC_Governor to discuss the state’s ongoing recovery from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. Our delegation stands ready to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure our communities have the resources they need to rebuild smarter and stronger. https://t.co/dJ4HKI7yzj Open Enrollment is only five more weeks – until December 15. Most people qualify for financial help and can get covered for less than $75 per month! Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered for 2019. Visit https://t.co/uWgFJKuob8 I'm honored to continue representing North Carolina's Fourth District, and I'm ready to resume the fight for progress on the issues my constituents care about in the 116th Congress. The American people spoke last Tuesday. They voted to protect health care for millions. They voted against massive tax handouts to the super rich. They voted to reduce the power of special interests. And they voted for a House that'll be a check on Donald Trump's reckless agenda. While we take time this #VeteransDay2018 to express our gratitude to our nation’s veterans and their families, let us never forget our duty to meet the needs of those who answered the call to serve. @UNCMedCenter https://t.co/UoUvb8JqLL Lisa &amp; I were proud to present Mickey Michaux with a copy of my remarks for the Congressional Record honoring his more than 4 decades of outstanding service to the people of NC. Mickey retires as a Civil Rights icon, a champion for social justice, and a trusted friend &amp; advisor. https://t.co/074j2gaEpL Beautiful, unifying Veterans Day ceremonies offer a heartbreaking contrast to the abuse and exploitation of our troops at the border by a deeply cynical president. https://t.co/qhl9A6Fqs1
