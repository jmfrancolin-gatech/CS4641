I urge my @GOP colleagues and the president to end this shutdown now. The House has done its part, we have passed bipartisan bills that can end this, lets get it done. https://t.co/O2lkoDVeSj I wish I could say this is unbelievable, but this is sadly in keeping with Donald Trump’s disregard for #PuertoRico and for #Latinos. Stealing from the recovery effort to fund the wall is beyond reprehensible.  As an Appropriator, I’ll do everything in my power to stop it. https://t.co/EOHO6yHzjb We invited the community to come in to discuss the issues regardless of their immigration status because everyone deserves to be heard. I opposed a wall then, and I oppose a wall now.  Construction of a border wall violates the moral values of our nation. https://t.co/BN4NbQk1oU I said to myself, why don't I take these bricks &amp; do just the opposite, &amp; make them a tribute to all immigrants. I collected 273 bricks &amp; brought them back to #TheBronx. @ahtway &amp; @billaguado teamed up to create a beautiful art piece at @HostosCollege w/ the bricks. 13 years ago we had a similar debate over walls. As that debate raged, thousands of bricks with hateful rhetoric like "No to illegals" &amp; "Secure our border" were sent to myself &amp; other colleagues that opposed a border wall. Did you really think we were going to hear something new from the White House? Same campaign speech pushing fear instead of  dealing with the truth. Lie after lie and telling us that México is paying for the wall. End the shutdown and let’s move on to immigration reform.

State and local law enforcement training programs will be stopped.  The Department of Justice’s civil litigation efforts against bad actors will halt.  Payments to crime victims will stop. More than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers will be forced to work without pay, including from the @FBI, @ATFHQ, @DEAHQ, as well as U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons personnel. 88 percent of @CommerceGov employees will be furloughed without pay- approximately 41,00 individuals.  These include employees at economic development programs like @US_EDA and @USMBDA.  96 percent of @NASA employees will be furloughed. As the top Democrat on the @AppropsDems Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice &amp; Science, I wanted to point out that the #TrumpShutdown would severely harm the agencies that under my oversight, including @NASA @CommerceGov @NWS @TheJusticeDept, @FBI &amp; others. https://t.co/kO9JdAYr1r Shutting down the government for an unnecessary border wall is shameful and goes against the values of our country. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/uB4cegiGGS Honored to have @FordhamNYC in the congressional district I represent.

Unbelievable that he is willing to put the livelihood of thousands of Americans on the line for the sake of an unnecessary border wall that won’t fix our broken immigration system. Failure to include funding for the border wall is the only thing keeping the President from approving &amp; signing the bipartisan CR legislation that the Senate passed, which the House is more than ready to pass. Wasn’t #Mexico supposed to pay for the wall? The president's stubbornness will cause a #TrumpShutdown in the middle of the Holiday season that will cost taxpayers billions of dollars &amp; leave over 420,000 Federal employees working w/o pay and another 400,000 furloughed. https://t.co/bMOduuv5g8 “Helping” the most vulnerable on the island by taking away their benefits and protections is a cruel and ineffective policy choice:  https://t.co/BOUtks9vpO Those policies will ultimately only make the situation worse for thousands of #Americans living on the island already suffering the consequences of the ongoing economic crisis. It appears to be nothing more than a flimsy justification to implement conservative economic policies and draconian austerity measures in #PuertoRico. Disappointed by the @washingtonpost op-ed from #PuertoRico's Financial Oversight Board Members blaming progressive working conditions &amp; safety net programs for the lack of economic activity and labor participation in Puerto Rico. .@DHSgov must reevaluate its detention practices &amp; investigate those involved in this horrific tragedy https://t.co/yVigsnTbXT It is tragic that a 7 year-old girl died of dehydration, starvation &amp; exhaustion while in @CBP custody.

There is no reason to rush a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and prevent Senators from having the information they need. #DelaytheVote RT @latinomuseum: The #latinomuseum won’t happen without congressional leadership. Enter @RepCardenas and @RepJoseSerrano! 💪🏽💪🏾💪🏿 https://t… It was a great meeting with a great group of dedicated advocates for this important issue. Thank you for your dedication and for a great meeting. https://t.co/egSrL3fC6p Met w/ @SBOEDC to discuss the @USMBDA Business Center Program which helps minority businesses start &amp; thrive. As Ranking Member of #CJS @AppropsDems Subcommittee that funds this program, I’m fighting to ensure SoBRO &amp; others have the $$ to keep doing this important work #TheBronx https://t.co/kLOz1ILZFg Hispanics have been here for 500 years and made significant contributions in every area throughout U.S. history. While some progress has been made, a @latinomuseum solely dedicated to Latino history, art and culture is long overdue: https://t.co/IlkKQ7pYVh #HHM One year later, there is significant work to still to be completed- from home repair to debris removal to electrical grid resilience.  The island still needs our help. #StandWithPuertoRico https://t.co/38I1L5Oz9o Today I introduced the #COMPROMISO Act, w/ @RepJenniffer @NydiaVelazquez @RepDarrenSoto @RepGutierrez. This legislation will hold the federal government to its promises by ensuring we continue to cover the costs of emergency assistance to the island as a result of #HurricaneMaria Read my Op-Ed on @thehill on this issue: https://t.co/L0R3Hvy3ey #PuertoRicoMaria+1 #StandWithPuertoRico A year later-#PuertoRico is still recovering from destruction caused by #HurricaneMaria. We must continue fighting for the help the island needs &amp; holding federal agencies accountable for the disbursement of the funding that has been set aside for its recovery &amp; reconstruction. This morning I will join @NYGovCuomo @rubendiazjr and other elected officials and members of the community as we observe the one year anniversary of hurricane Maria striking #PuertoRIco and to show our continued support for a full recovery. #Maria https://t.co/mYCG91EoMa It has been exactly one year since #HurricaneMaria made landfall in #PuertoRico &amp; the island still faces many challenges, in part because of federal government’s inadequate response. We must continue to work together to help the island rebuild, with no strings attached. https://t.co/mwGheOvUaw Wishing all those in observance an easy and meaningful fast. https://t.co/L3usvE6wQQ More than 7 months since Congress passed emergency aid, @usedgov has not disbursed nearly 60% of it. This is unacceptable to the students &amp; institutions still recovering from the storms.

Great memories from the Smith Graduations. Hope all is well. My best wishes. Many of these issues are still affecting the island. To make things worse, he visited Puerto Rico briefly only to miss most of the island &amp; throw paper towels at a crowd for “relief". Leadership comes from the top, @realDonaldTrump failed the American citizens of #PuertoRico -Many people/homes, hospitals &amp; businesses spent months w/o electricity, water, &amp;/or access to health care/medical supplies, which caused general chaos &amp; led many people to die. -Trump hesitated &amp; was slow to get more personnel &amp; equipment to Puerto Rico- despite scale of disaster

-@fema was not prepared for the storm in Puerto Rico-they lacked supplies, equipment &amp; personnel 2,975 Americans died in #PuertoRico after #HurricaneMaria, a fact confirmed by independent studies. Only @DonaldTrump &amp; his Administration refuse to acknowledge. These are 2,975 deaths under #Trump’s watch &amp; could have been prevented w/ a quicker &amp; a better federal response..... https://t.co/ggKIzzvapV Today is #ElectionDay in New York- it is your chance to make your voice heard!
