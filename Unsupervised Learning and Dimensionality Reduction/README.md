Requirements:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib and graphviz

Environment:
python3

The project is divided into 2 main sub-folders, Wine and Political Affilication.
Each sub-folder has a .cvs file with the data set and a .py the code. In order
to replicate the experimments described in the analyses, just run both python
files.

For more information on how I extracted the Political Affilication data-set,
please reffer to Assigment 1. In sum, it is a vectorized dictionary with Tweets
of American politicians.
