We cannot let our government be shutdown again as a negotiating tactic over any policy difference and I was concerned that the President did not appear to rule out another government shutdown. 4/ I am a third generation military veteran. I believe we must protect all of our borders - land, air, and sea - and we must protect our values. I support smart, effective and efficient border security measures. 3/ improve infrastructure and our education system, pass common sense gun safety measures, and reform our broken immigration system. We must come together, with the Executive and Legislative branches working collaboratively, to pass legislation that will help American families 2/ I appreciate the Presidentâ€™s #SOTU call for unity and hope that he is willing to work with Congress. I hope that we can come together in bipartisan manner to increase access to affordable and quality healthcare, bring good paying jobs with good benefits to our community, 1/ Proud to welcome Michelle Roberson to the Capitol tonight as my #SOTU guest.

This shutdown has already lasted 18 days and 800,000 federal workers are at risk of losing their paychecks. 3/ I am a 3rd gen veteran and understand that we must protect all of our borders (land, air and sea) and pass bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, but there are more efficient and cost-effective ways to securing our borders than by building a costly southern border wall. 2/ Within hours of being sworn-in for the 116th Congress, the House passed bipartisan legislation that Senate Republicans had already passed in December to fund and reopen the government. This shutdown, which is affecting millions of families, is a manufactured crisis. 1/ Gun violence is an issue that has been plaguing our communities for far too long.
