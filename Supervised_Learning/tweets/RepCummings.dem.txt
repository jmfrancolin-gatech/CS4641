I am proud to have voted for each of the eight measures Democrats in the House of Representatives brought to the floor to end the shutdown and provide funding to government agencies. I am glad to have voted to pass legislation to provide federal employees with back pay once the shutdown ends, but that does little to alleviate the pain of our nation‚Äôs public servants who went from living paycheck to paycheck, to paycheck to no check. The more than 23,000 Maryland-based federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay have already missed one paycheck, and are now forced to contemplate the possibility of going an entire month ‚Äì or even longer ‚Äì  without pay. Every day the shutdown continues, the pain felt by the over 800,000 affected federal workers only increases as anxieties about how to pay rent, cover medical expenses, and provide for their families deepen. The American people deserve to have their government back at work for them, and federal employees deserve their pay.  Our government must be better than this. On the 26th day of the Trump shutdown, I again voted to end the shutdown and fund government agencies. This shutdown has gone on for far too long.

This recognition proves that diversity is our promise, not our problem. Allowing discrimination and harassment to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service. This bill will give federal interns the same protections already provided to federal employees. This is a great start, but more must be done. I urge my colleagues to also support the Unpaid Intern Protection Act, which would give interns outside of government similar protections. The act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or sex is not currently prohibited by federal law. Under existing law, victims rely on the discretion and integrity of managers to prevent this behavior. I am pleased that the House passed my bill, the Federal Intern Protection Act, to close a loophole in federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment without any legal recourse.

I am pleased to cosponsor and support bipartisan legislation in the House that ensures federal employees affected by a shutdown receive retroactive pay. However, the President and Congressional Republicans decided to proceed with this shutdown because of the President's demand that taxpayers foot the bill for his border wall; the same wall the President promised the American people they would not have to pay to build. This shutdown was completely avoidable, and Congressional Democrats offered multiple options to keep the government open. At midnight, President Trump and Congressional Republicans forced the government to partially shut down.  Because of this shutdown, over 800,000 federal employees will go without pay over the holiday season.
