Investigation into Trump campaign/Russian attack on our democracy is a national security imperative.

He can either perform a dog &amp; pony show for Individual 1. 

Or Whitaker can respect the House of Representatives. 

He can‚Äôt do both.

We must confront and eradicate rise of Anti-Semitism in America with the fierce urgency of now. 

This. Is. Not. Acceptable. Dems continue to focus on lower healthcare costs and a real infrastructure plan. 

But the House also has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight into Individual 1.

And we will not be bullied by the President. 

Ever.
https://t.co/1lmsDbaIhA We stand ready to lower healthcare costs, enact a real infrastructure plan and eradicate HIV. But we will not waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a medieval üè∞ border wall. Not now. Not ever. 400 years ago the first slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia.

#ForThePeople A few #MDC updates. Lock down conditions are being addressed. Detainees regaining shower access. Power lines are being worked on to restore family communication. Change in weather has improved conditions. More to be done. WE WILL STAY VIGILANT. Just spoke with BOP Director and reiterated (among other things) the following:

Building-wide lock down must end asap. 

Health of elderly and medically challenged inmates must be prioritized. 

Family visitation/communication must resume.

Will continue fight #ForThePeople. My initial takeaways from MDC visit:

1. BOP must restore power immediately. 

2. Timely food service must begin immediately.

3. Access to showers must be resumed immediately.

4. Commence inmate town hall mtg tomorrow morning.

Now we must keep our promise to the American people to lower healthcare costs and fight #ForThePeople House back in session today. Right-wing advance has been halted. Now we will fight to Lower Healthcare Costs, Increase Pay and GO ON OFFENSE #ForThePeople Democrats win Senate Seat in Arizona! And now GOP has been shutout in swing states like Nevada, Ohio, PA, Wis, Minnesota and Michigan. Red wave from Trump &amp; McConnell? Not. Even. A. Ripple. https://t.co/FGSjtFMqI9 Satellite images apparently show North Korea continuing its nuclear weapons program, thereby punking the Trump administration. Isn‚Äôt he supposed to be a great negotiator? Yeah right. Thankful to all of the Veterans of America who have served abroad in order to keep us free at home.

And we‚Äôre just getting started #ForThePeople We promised to lower health care costs, protect people w/ pre-existing conditions and reduce outrageously high prescription drug prices. And that‚Äôs what we intend to do #ForThePeople Scott Walker and Kris Kobach are unemployed. Medicaid expansion ballot initiatives prevailed in 3 states. Wiped out Trump apologists in suburban America. Took back more than 350 state legislative seats.

And won governorships in places like Kansas, Nevada, Maine and New Mexico #BlueWave We flipped more than 30 seats and took back the House. Elected Native American women to Congress for the first time. There were 6 races for senate and gov in PA, Wisconsin and Michigan. Democrats won all six #BlueWave In today‚Äôs America you can lose your life anytime, anyplace, anywhere to a mass shooting. But so-called President and Republican Cover-up Caucus lie to you about immigrant caravan threats. They. Are. Shameless. Let‚Äôs be clear about what happened yesterday. America sent a message by electing a Democratic House that Affordable Healthcare is a right (not a privilege) and this is the beginning of the end of the Make America Hate Again traveling circus #RealTalk Actually, his ‚Äúopponent‚Äù is a Rhodes Scholar. Harvard Law educated attorney. And having just defeated the Republican incumbent YOU supported, is the next Congressman from the 19th congressional district in New York.

And then they do the exact opposite. We. Will. Walk. The. Walk #ForThePeople We‚Äôre focused on #LowerHealthCareCosts. Republicans want to take your healthcare away. They fight for the privileged few. We fight #ForThePeople. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be any higher. Hate wins, when we let it divide us.
