We will continue our fight until we enact change. Period. #HR8 You’re in our thoughts, Debbie, and you and John are in our prayers.

Its about time. "If there is going to be peace &amp; legislation, there cannot be war &amp; investigation."

President Trump’s party is in the minority in the House because Americans are fed up with Congress’ refusal to take action on gun reform. President Trump failed to address it. Misogyny turns deadly in Isla Vista streets. 

President Trump’s failure to address gun violence directly is a grave disappointment. We will not stop fighting for a #SOTU2EndGunViolence Failure to address gun violence means all forms of hate are more deadly. 

Antisemitism turns deadly in a Pittsburgh synagogue. 

Racism turns deadly in a Charleston bible study. 

Domestic violence turns deadly in a Texas sanctuary. Overwhelmed to see Herman &amp; Joshua, Holocaust survivor and Dachau liberator, sitting side by side in House Chamber. We must never forget those who suffered unspeakable horrors and those who fought for freedom.  #SOTU The Tree of Life attack was the worst attack on the American Jewish community in history. We are so honored to have Judah in attendance tonight. He should inspire us all to fight all forms of bigotry and never forget the horrors of the Holocaust. #SOTU Nearly one year ago I gave @realdonaldtrump a #MSDstrong bracelet. I wanted it to be the last, but we’ve seen so many mass shootings since—including at Tree of Life. 

It’s time for action on gun violence. https://t.co/mbcZhm2m8L To combat the scourge of anti-Semitism, we must never hesitate to call it out wherever and whenever it occurs. Agreed, we cannot avert attention from the Iranian threat. We also shouldn’t divert resources from efforts against Iran’s destabilizing actions. Pulling the US from Syria creates a vacuum that Iran &amp; its terror proxies will try to fill, giving them a foothold on Israel’s border. .@realDonaldTrump, if you want to improve the state of our union, listen to the over 90% of Americans who want universal background checks for all gun purchases. #HR8

 #SOTU ACA &amp; Medicaid provide coverage bedrock for Americans living with HIV. Trump has tried to overturn and cut these vital programs. #SOTU Democrats and Republicans can stand together to fight HIV/AIDS, which disproportionally affects the LGBTQ community and minority communities.

Bob is the longest held American hostage and we fail him and his family every day we don’t bring him home. @helpboblevinson We stand with the people of Venezuela and their right to exercise democracy. Maduro’s authoritarian regime has decimated the country and made life miserable for the people. We must stand firmly against this undemocratic regime and with the people. #SOTU It’s staggering but true - The United States does not guarantee parents paid leave to be with their newborn children. We must change this on the national level and offer paid leave for new parents. #SOTU The Obama Administration’s cancer moonshot put the whole of American creativity and innovation behind the search for a cure. 

If President Trump wants to match that commitment, I’m all for it. 

#SOTU Healthcare for folks across the country has been under constant fire by this President. If he wants to improve our healthcare system, he should start by ending his years long campaign to take away coverage. #SOTU2019 Democrats are ready with plans for modernizing our nation’s infrastructure and reducing prescription drug prices. We’ve been waiting two years for the President. Let’s get to work on these bipartisan priorities. #SOTU Americans are in rare agreement.

97% want background checks on every gun sale.

What about gun owners?

97% want background checks on every gun sale.

Why? Bc they already do them when they buy from stores.

Why let people who aren’t responsible easily get guns online w/o a ✅? Going after gangs is and will remain a priority for our law enforcement. But comparing families fleeing violence and seeking asylum to horrific criminals like MS-13 is cruel, unfair, and wrong. #SOTU Anyone listening to @POTUS talk about the border can tell he’s overselling it. Listen to the experts. There are parts of the border where barriers make sense. Trump needs to stop wall talk and start real talk. Let’s find good policy and stop making this about politics. #SOTU Democrats have a real plan to secure our southern border. We can use advanced technology, enhanced personnel, and screening at ports of entry to achieve far more than Trump’s useless wall ever would. #SOTU A wall along the border won’t stop most illegal drugs and weapons smuggled through ports of entry. We need effective border security policies, incl. modern detection technology at ports of entry.  A wall won’t do. #SOTU What the President calls “ridiculous partisan investigations” the American people call the search for truth.  #ProtectMueller

#SOTU American elections should be decided without interference from Russia.

The government shutdown is directly &amp; severely harming 800,000 people. Individuals are falling behind bills and families are unable to cover healthcare costs because their last paycheck was $0.00. The shutdown is also affecting millions of Americans, directly and indirectly. Martin Luther King jr. left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten. He led a movement for equality that helped strengthen the basic civil rights that every person deserves. His work is unfinished and on this #MLKDAY we should recommit to continuing the fight. https://t.co/aB4LsLvjEb RT @RepJoeKennedy: President Trump turned America’s back on Dreamers. He abandoned our neighbors protected by TPS. He created a humanitaria… .@SenRickScott @marcorubio have you met with any of your constituents who are out of work or working without pay &amp; struggling because of the shutdown? 

They need your help to demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote to open the government. Looking forward to working with Chairman @RepJerryNadler to ensure the American people know the truth. https://t.co/bZcEg15sAJ Terror attacks in Kenya and Colombia resulted in the loss of over 40 innocent lives. These attacks should remind us of the importance of global CT efforts. The Middle East, N. Africa, and Int’l Terrorism subcommittee will ensure the US continues CT cooperation with our partners. I urge @POTUS to make the return of my constituent Bob Levinson a top priority. Bob is the longest held American hostage and must be brought home to his family. @helpboblevinson https://t.co/EgMjJZ7G6y My heart breaks for the family of Jonathan Farmer of Boynton Beach and the other families for their loss. These service members made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country and the values we stand for. We owe them our unending gratitude. 

https://t.co/R2TVys8LHY I’ll be on @Morning_Joe @MSNBC shortly to discuss revelation that President Trump may have directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Join me. https://t.co/XIdDiKjOqt Cohen is now alleging Trump instructed him to pay for poll rigging. How much more smoke do we need? https://t.co/M1HOCvZ2iK Aviation safety inspectors in South Florida should be working to keep our skies safe. Instead, many struggle to pay bills and cover important health costs.

Let's end the pain of this shutdown, reopen the government, and get employees back to work with paychecks. https://t.co/RRoNyhqpwF I welcome my new Democratic colleagues on the @HouseForeign Affairs Committee. Let’s continue the proud bipartisan work of the Cmte in promoting American values &amp; defending human rights around the world, standing firmly with our allies &amp; against our enemies. RT @MFOLDC: Last night MFOL DC leaders had the honor to join members of congress who are GVP champions and #MarchForOurLives founders

The… Circle of people Trump/Giuliani have suggested hacked/colluded is tightening. 

- 400lb guy
- a guy in NJ
- DNC
- China
- Russia
- Trump Campaign

Not much room left...

https://t.co/rMcMSrs07q RT @AaronBlake: Trump team's collusion denials:

1) No contact
3) Contacts not *planned*
4) Okay planned, but not re: campaign
5) Okay, but… RT @IsaacDovere: progression:
-no mtg
-was a mtg, but about adoption
-mtg wasn’t re adoption
-nothing offered
-what was offered wasn’t good… Rudy Giuliani now says maybe the Trump Campaign did collude—but not the president himself.

As past denials fall apart, excuse us if we don’t take your—or the president’s—word for it. https://t.co/Y6ngt2M6y2 Again and again the @HouseDemocrats have put forward bills to reopen the gov only to have the Senate GOP block them because they would rather back Trump than let workers receive the pay that they’ve earned. This level of obstruction is absurd. Stop choosing politics over people. https://t.co/Rfw3j9RCWb RT @GiffordsCourage: Most get wiser with age—the NRA seems to be an exception.

Congress stands with them, and I know my new colleagues will help do everything they can to bring Bob Levinson home. @helpboblevinson https://t.co/w2JU2icNUp Trump seems to have difficulty selecting a good leader for the EPA. Pruitt’s time with the agency was a disaster and now Trump has nominated Andrew Wheeler who believes climate change “is not the greatest crisis”. 

If you feel that way, Mr. Wheeler, you should find another job. https://t.co/tPTtdtT3PU RT @AdamSchiff: Barr does not believe a president can be indicted, and that impeachment is the constitutional remedy. 

Yet Barr will not c… A half-century ago we made a commitment to not let our fellow Americans go hungry. SNAP and food banks fulfill that promise. 

Donald Trump’s shutdown is breaking it. https://t.co/SM9L8wcuRb The memory of Joaquin Oliver will forever motivate us to keep our kids safe from guns. I was thankful to join @changetheref &amp; @AMarch4OurLives along with @ayannapressley, @repjoekennedy @repdonbeyer &amp; so many others that came out to reaffirm our commitment to ending gun violence. https://t.co/ZR6cygFNhi Manny Oliver, who lost his son Joaquin to gun violence in Parkland, reminds us all that our responsibility is to get something DONE.

Thx @DrLeanaWen 
Thx @PPFA
Thx @ProChoiceCaucus https://t.co/ri0r3vc02U Apparently the vast other responsibilities of the Attorney General of the United States were not on President Trump’s mind. https://t.co/64XeEzHfBb 25 days of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they’ll cover their basic costs of living, like rent &amp; groceries. @realDonaldTrump, enough is enough. The House has voted multiple times to re-open government. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/xXeKbq0ucQ William Barr sent a 19-page memo arguing against potential obstruction of justice charges to Trump’s personal defense lawyers and Jared Kushner’s defense team. 

If DOJ ethics lawyers recommend his recusal based on these facts, Barr should commit to following their guidance. RT @DrLeanaWen: “I am proud to stand here with Planned Parenthood.” -@RepTedDeutch https://t.co/ew1Tf0AH7h https://t.co/ELazv8yY3o William Barr is saying the right things about Mueller TODAY, but Senators shouldn’t ignore potential conflicts raised by his unsolicited memo to Trump’s defense team on obstruction of justice. 

To remove shadow over his appointment, he must follow DOJ ethics recommendations. https://t.co/1eJ0AckhkQ DOJ ethics lawyers often review potential conflicts of interest &amp; recommend recusal if needed. 

Usually, their advice is followed. 

Acting AG Whitaker didn’t follow advice to recuse from the Mueller probe. 

If confirmed, is Barr committed to following ethics recommendations? Barr’s nomination to be the next AG means he will have total control over the Mueller investigation. He has pledged transparency and fairness, but his records indicate otherwise. Actions speak louder than words. 800,000 federal workers missed paychecks because of the #TrumpShutdown, incl. civil servants who keep our country safe.

@HouseDemocrats have passed bills to reopen the government; we're still waiting for Senate Republicans and the President to act. Read my #SF100 @SoFlaOpinion https://t.co/tCysbwOacH
