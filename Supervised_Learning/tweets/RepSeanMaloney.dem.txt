I‚Äôm a proud supporter of initiatives to make DC more accountable and transparent. https://t.co/QKcjvHYLh8 I think all elected officials should be held accountable to the people they serve - here‚Äôs a look at all of the work I‚Äôve gotten done since taking office six years ago. There‚Äôs still work to be done - and I‚Äôm ready to get after it. https://t.co/oa8ONWx80o Our vets served and sacrificed to protect our country. Now, it's our turn to pay attention and be ready to recognize the signs of PTSD and TBI and offer help. If you - or a vet you know - are struggling with one of these unseen illness, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/g6zzeKc5M3 You elected me to serve with the understanding that I would be transparent about the progress I‚Äôve made. And I plan to deliver on that. Here‚Äôs a look at what we‚Äôve gotten done in 2018: https://t.co/SZ4NVSdFVE Not only is the U.S. the only developed country in the world that cannot get its head in the game on #climatechange, it‚Äôs also now the country that is actively burying reports on how to combat this issue. I‚Äôm fighting every anti-environment policy the White House throws our way. https://t.co/nEzMbyqDhI In the last two years, Washington Republicans have fought relentlessly to roll back the progress we‚Äôve made. I‚Äôll keep fighting to protect it. https://t.co/0iExBkmlRb Cancer screenings, preventative care, vaccinations: these are the critical services that @PPFA provides to so many folks in the Hudson Valley. We can‚Äôt let congressional Republicans‚Äô radical, anti-women agenda dismantle these key supports. Share if you‚Äôre with me. https://t.co/fwt7ws9ZUc So many vets risked life and limb for our country, and are now looking for ways to secure the service medals they earned. Good news: my office is here to help, and we‚Äôve already helped literally thousands of HV vets. Give my Newburgh office a ring and we‚Äôll help you through it. https://t.co/xzHtsXLWBT You‚Äôve worked hard your whole life, paid into the system, and are now counting on your hard-earned retirement benefits. Democrats will soon be in control of the House, and you can rest assured that protecting Social Security will remain at the top of our to-do list. https://t.co/MYItKgOaPE Absolutely terrible. Feel for Felipe‚Äôs family. Will get to the bottom of this ASAP. https://t.co/2DkTtYZ0l7 Health care costs too damn much. And it‚Äôs up to Congress to work together and bring down costs while improving plan options for folks across the country. I‚Äôm ready to take the Majority in January and do just that. https://t.co/LBQuJAk8df Merry Christmas from my family to yours! https://t.co/NbKl4Lzz3e Don‚Äôt let the bureaucracy give you the run-around: if you‚Äôre looking for help cutting through red tape, give my office in Newburgh a call. We‚Äôve already helped thousands of your neighbors - and we can help you too. https://t.co/CV7HHyTTzR One homeless veteran is one too many. This Congress, I introduced the Housing Our Heroes Act, which would renovate "zombie" properties and turn them into homes for our vets. Getting this passed in the next Congress will be a top priority for me. Read more: https://t.co/bvkOF8zZMe https://t.co/6GUFa225hf Congress can no longer afford to sit on its hands and hold back on fighting the opioid epidemic. This is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we need to tackle this crisis head on with a comprehensive approach. Here‚Äôs my plan: https://t.co/aHu6C3mk4i It's our responsibility to make sure our veterans have access to the services they earned. My bill would help bridge that gap for new veterans. Although it passed the House, it didn‚Äôt make it through the Senate. Passing this into law will be one of my top priorities next year. https://t.co/XovaQJGqJc We saw attacks on our progressive values in the 115th Congress -- I was proud to fight back against every awful policy Washington Republicans threw our way. We need to keep up the fight in the next two years, and you can rest assured I‚Äôll stand up to fight for our values. https://t.co/4zUUvT4zQE @AmericasMazz Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Introduced bills last year to do that. https://t.co/51Cor2lZFU Shutdowns are exactly why I‚Äôm such a big supporter of the No Budget, No Pay Act. #Enough https://t.co/FWYSRzqYli Meanwhile Congress still gets paid even though it made the mess in the first place. Need to pass No Budget, No Pay Act. Fed workers are getting screwed. Almost 8/10 Americans live paycheck to paycheck &amp; Trump‚Äôs shutdown means thousands have to make ends meet (around holidays) w/o normal pay. Not fair. https://t.co/0MZm6203zF About a quarter of fed agencies shut down last night - so did authorization for #VAWA. This can‚Äôt be another casualty of the Trump Tantrum - have to reauthorize ASAP. 
https://t.co/X92DC1At5h As I have in the past, I will instruct the House administration office to withhold my pay during any government shutdown. Congress should not get paid until it does its job. The Trump Tantrum has to stop ‚Äì we have a job to do for the people we represent. Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the House were collaborating on bipartisan measures to avoid a shut down. Only the President ‚Äî by his own admission ‚Äî wanted this crisis. We can protect the border and keep the government open at the same time. Shutdown, Mattis out, markets in chaos, US troops leaving Syria. Trump Admin trying to put on a brave face like: https://t.co/b26M5XdPQ5 This #shutdown threat is the REAL war on Christmas.

It‚Äôs really that simple.
