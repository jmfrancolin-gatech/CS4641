But this vote was about the farm bill. @kenklippenstein 6/7 I wouldn’t be exercising my oversight responsibilities if I didn’t meet with them. “Meeting with” does not mean “supporting.” In fact, I made SA pretty mad when I supported the Iran deal. And when I voted to sunset the AUMF last year. @kenklippenstein 5/7 Since coming into Congress, I’ve been to over 50 countries + met with officials from all of them, allies and enemies. I welcome meetings with foreign leaders because dialogue is important. @kenklippenstein 4/7 I was asked by Rep. Peterson to support the rule to advance the Farm Bill. He expressed serious concern that the widely-supported farm bill wouldn’t advance if the rule failed. Speculation about a clean rule later is just that: speculation. @kenklippenstein 3/7 I didn’t meet with the Saudis three times in 2015. I met with them once. A staffer met with them once. We discussed a PEACEFUL resolution to the conflict in Yemen, not the violence that ensued. @kenklippenstein 2/7 If – BIG IF – the resolution is brought up under privilege, it probably would have been tabled by the Republican leadership. We’ll vote in January and I’ll be a YES. @kenklippenstein 1/7. I’m compelled to respond to the factual inaccuracies in this piece (I’ll let the spelling of my name slide). First, the rule was not a motion to debate Rep. Khanna’s resolution. If the rule fails, the war in Yemen continues.
