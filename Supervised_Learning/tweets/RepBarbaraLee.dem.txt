https://t.co/o1kHro8MLg Nothing about President Trump surprises me anymore. But it‚Äôs still important to call out his ugly tactics. 

That entire speech last night was designed to divide us and demonize families seeking asylum. It won‚Äôt work, but it does show us how hateful his policies are. Because of the #TrumpShutdown, #SNAP nutrition benefits are in jeopardy for millions of Americans. I sent a letter with Rep. @RosaDeLauro and 127 of our colleagues demanding a plan from the @USDA to prevent this catastrophe. https://t.co/jpvKSUwkYO ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about not having food this week.‚Äù
 
800k federal workers like J√∫lia don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre going to afford groceries, rent, &amp; bills. President Trump needs to stop punishing working people and using families like J√∫lia‚Äôs as political pawns.
https://t.co/AjOdb7VmQw For years, @HouseGOP has stood in the way of any meaningful reforms to #EndGunViolence. That ends now. 
 
Today, @HouseDemocrats introduced #HR8 to enact universal background checks on gun purchases.

@RepKatiePorter President Trump needs to stop playing games with people‚Äôs livelihoods and end this shameful shutdown.

Republicans‚Äô refusal to compromise is jeopardizing basic health care, education and food assistance on tribal lands. This is a disgrace. 
https://t.co/aCSMUekXXm Contract workers like custodians &amp; cafeteria workers are some of the lowest paid people in the federal govt. Under the #TrumpShutdown, they won‚Äôt see a dime of back pay. It‚Äôs infuriating &amp; utterly unfair that hardworking families are paying for Pres Trump‚Äôs incompetence. https://t.co/BQTQDMY25e Here‚Äôs the difference between Republicans and Democrats right now:
