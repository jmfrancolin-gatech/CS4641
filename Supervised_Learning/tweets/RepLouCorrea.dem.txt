Last week’s record fentanyl seizure was at a port of entry! If #America wants to stop the cartels, Americans also need to stop buying their drugs.

Are you ready? @realDonaldTrump praises our #military but cuts programs #veterans depend on.

It’s time we get to work and solve this problem for our communities, our constituents, and our brothers and sisters desperate for a second chance and a roof over their heads. RT @VetAffairsDems: Mr. President, 

Instead of pushing for a #BorderWall how about we:

1️⃣ Pass H.R. 299 &amp; grant Blue Water Navy Veterans… I’m on @CNNDUSA to talk about the President’s border wall and government #shutdown. Tune in. A new day in DC for @HouseDemocrats! @SpeakerPelosi quotes President Reagan and vows support of #DREAMers, while #KevinMcCarthy calls for Trump’s #wall! California Dems leading the way! Happy to welcome the most diverse Congress in #USA history! The #American people are counting on us. Let's get to work! A #TrumpShutdown of the southern border would crush California &amp; Texas’s economies. Hundreds of billions in business lost. Texas alone could lose a million jobs. 

@realDonaldTrump is taking people’s lives hostage. $615 billion &amp; over a million jobs. That’s what our President is holding hostage by threatening to close the border. He would fire a million Americans over a political promise that won’t work. 

Just as with his business @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care who loses as long as he wins. @SecNielsen this is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth? Tragic Breaking News on Christmas Morning. I’m working to find out more. This will not go unanswered. 

👉🏽👉🏽 https://t.co/7d2AtToBOY @ChadPergram Democrats must be included in all negotiations. We must end the shutdown. Latest on the shut down: President now having lunch with Republican Senators and leaders of Republican Congressional Freedom Caucus. No Dem participation. @realDonaldTrump publicly said he’d welcome a government shutdown. This is no way to lead our great nation. @SecWilkie - The passage of the Farm Bill means #CBD is now legal. @DeptVetAffairs needs to start researching how this new medicine can help vets living w/ #TBI &amp; #PTSD. Let’s get to work for our #veterans. The young migrant girl who died in @CBP custody was a casualty of the President’s obsession with building an unnecessary border wall instead of investing in the resources &amp; training CBP needs. @DHSgov leadership must be held responsible.

Today’s report shows how right they were. We cannot continue to ignore the signs all around us. Our homes, communities, and economy are at jeopardy. After two years @realDonaldTrump still doesn’t understand how important judicial independence is to our legal system. I applaud Justice Roberts for standing in defense of the rule of law. @realDonaldTrump Firefighters have died. First responders have died. Californians have died. Your response to their sacrifices shows that you don’t understand California’s challenges. Devastated by the news coming out of Thousands Oaks. My thoughts and prayers are with the families, especially Sheriff’s Deputy Ron Helus’ family, whose bravery &amp; sacrifice saved countless lives. Mr. Mueller and the investigation into foreign interference of the 2016 election must not be impeded. It is imperative that whomever @realDonaldTrump selects to replace Jeff Sessions, vows to continue and protect the ongoing investigation.

They can’t.
