It’s a beautiful Christmas Eve in Chattanooga. https://t.co/lHxioV5v4b Elizabeth and I wish you and your family and very merry Christmas and a happy new year. https://t.co/Hdy30vT62R Yes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/4LwrkrSFFr RT @CNNSotu: Good Morning! Today on #CNNSOTU w/ @JakeTapper: @SenBobCorker, @RandPaul, @RepAdamSchiff, @ninaturner, @RickSantorum, @PaulBeg… Tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. ET, I’ll join @jaketapper on @CNNSOTU to discuss government funding, Secretary Mattis’ stellar service, the president’s decision on Syria, and other news of the day. #CNNSOTU https://t.co/owbloNumJk Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer agreed today that no votes will come to the Senate floor that President Trump and House and Senate leaders have not all agreed to in advance. Now Republicans and Democrats both own the success or failure to fund government. For the record, I am still in D.C. for votes and won’t be heading home to Chattanooga until the Senate reaches resolution on today’s vote(s). While rules changes may be in order at some point, I will continue to follow rules relative to legislation as they exist today as I finish my term. My statement on the resignation of Secretary of Defense James Mattis: https://t.co/fR96pZnPiJ I’m glad to join @_GFEMS in welcoming Norway as a partner in the fight against modern slavery and human trafficking. There’s much more work to be done, but I'm encouraged that our bold vision for the global fund continues to garner broad support. https://t.co/0GwhzMjqrM One of the highlights of my time in the Senate has been working with @SenAlexander.

I am thankful for his many years of friendship and grateful for his life that was well lived. https://t.co/j8oAD94zh0 Pleased the Senate spoke with one voice this afternoon and overwhelmingly passed the joint resolution I authored to hold Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi. Thank you, @senrobportman, for your strong support of this important resolution. https://t.co/jr9aImM1Kn Just offered a joint resolution with a number of my colleagues to condemn the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi and hold the Saudi Crown Prince accountable.

Watch live here: https://t.co/7SeJDtjEWV. #enditmovement #EndSlaveryAct Stephen Vaden’s experience in law and understanding of the needs of farmers will be an important asset as @USDA and Congress work to help rural America prosper and grow. My statement on his confirmation: https://t.co/qb2ZGlkZet. https://t.co/9khxmbjhWu It was an honor to meet with Raed. I am sad to learn of his death. More than 7 years into the civil war in Syria, good men and women continue to sacrifice their lives for a better future. Congress should recognize their sacrifice and pass the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. https://t.co/kewnhFxMbU Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/piSt9pTlkQ Under the law, the president is now required to determine whether MbS is responsible and report to our committee with a determination and a decision on the imposition of sanctions. Read our letter: https://t.co/G9xFGyw4TH “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t” won’t cut it. So tonight, @SenatorMenendez and I sent a second Global Magnitsky letter to the president requiring that he specifically determine whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi. Congress will consider all of the tools at our disposal to respond, including requiring by law a determination on the role of MbS. I never thought I’d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/MQ4JsoQtqk Everything points to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, MbS, ordering @washingtonpost journalist Jamal #Khashoggi's killing. The Trump administration should make a credible determination of responsibility before MbS executes the men who apparently carried out his orders. I have a lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid. My full statement on the Global Magnitsky sanctions against Saudi officials for the murder of #JamalKhashoggi: https://t.co/EEM0HzGgwg I thank Bill Johnson for his service to @TVAnews and look forward to continued strong leadership from the next president and CEO.

Glad to have so many folks in Chattanooga for one of the world’s largest rowing regattas. Congratulations to all of the participants! https://t.co/SwKo0y8a6o Horrified by the deadly act of violence inspired by hate at a synagogue in Pittsburgh earlier this morning. By taking a multifaceted approach, we can responsibly help combat this increasingly devastating problem. I thank @SenAlexander for his leadership on this issue and am pleased the president has signed this legislation into law. Learn more: https://t.co/YDRcU8mBpX. https://t.co/62qtjICPbH They can undergo their own investigation, but the U.S. administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi’s murder under the Global Magnitsky investigation as required by law. The story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water. Sad to hear of the passing of Lacy Upchurch. A lifelong farmer, he understood the importance of Tennessee’s agriculture community and represented the @TNFarmBureau for a decade with dedication and commitment. My thoughts are with his wife, Kay, and his family. In light of the circumstances, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin did the right thing in not going to the Saudi investment summit. https://t.co/mg1SRjapbJ This has been a long and painful ordeal for Pastor Andrew Brunson and his family, and we are relieved that they will finally be reunited after this long period of his unjust imprisonment.

My statement: https://t.co/yu6MzVLyqR. #StandWithSongwriters https://t.co/UQReWgceaE Today, we sent a letter to the administration triggering an investigation and Global Magnitsky sanctions determination regarding the disappearance of Saudi journalist and @washingtonpost columnist #JamalKhashoggi. https://t.co/reqXtmqfJt I know @nikkihaley will continue to be a strong voice for our country and wish her well in whatever comes next. .@nikkihaley has been a fierce advocate for U.S. interests during her time as U.N. ambassador. While I hated to hear of her departure, I have enjoyed working with her and am thankful for her willingness to serve. Today in Venezuela, Fernando Albán, a young opposition leader, died while in the government’s custody. This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened. Our thoughts are with #JamalKhashoggi’s family and colleagues at the @washingtonpost. I have raised Jamal's disappearance personally with the Saudi ambassador, and while we await more information, know we will respond accordingly to any state that targets journalists abroad. I spoke with @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer on @FoxNews ahead of this afternoon’s vote to #ConfirmKavanaugh. Watch here: https://t.co/336vjh5mwa Glad the #BUILDAct has been signed into law. This effort will begin to move us away from providing direct assistance with mixed results and instead help countries become more self-reliant. https://t.co/B63ZieUfpd Transferring the countless injustices that have happened to women for decades onto a person who had nothing to do with them is an injustice, just as seeking to elevate one’s own political stature by wrongly destroying someone else’s reputation is an injustice. The supplemental background investigation found absolutely zero corroboration of the allegations that have been made. I plan to vote for Judge Kavanaugh and believe he will be confirmed very soon. Thanks to strong support from the administration, in both houses of Congress, and among businesses and nongovernmental organizations, this transformative effort is now on its way to the president’s desk. The #BUILDAct will begin to move us away from providing direct assistance with mixed results and instead help countries become more self-reliant while saving taxpayers millions of dollars. Glad that our bill with @ChrisCoons to promote economic growth in developing countries through U.S. business investment while saving taxpayers $20 million will now become law. Learn more about the #BUILDAct: https://t.co/3yLAdeNqWU. This is a reasonable agreement and should bring additional clarity to the final vote. https://t.co/yrCboRMlQp Phil Trenary was a true champion for Memphis.

I am hopeful the House will send our legislation to the president’s desk to be signed into law. My statement: https://t.co/uTPrb6TfkY. #StandWithSongwriters https://t.co/bOJ290JXzJ After learning of the allegation, Chairman @ChuckGrassley took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private. Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don’t hear from both sides on Monday, let’s vote. I thank @SenAlexander for his leadership on this legislation and applaud the Senate for coming together in a bipartisan manner to help countless Americans who have been impacted by this crisis.

As the president taxes Americans with tariffs, he pushes away our allies and further strengthens Putin. 
 
It is time for Congress to step up and take back our authorities. 
 
We have legislation to do that. Let’s vote. As I said yesterday, the Helsinki press conference was saddening and disappointing, and I am glad people on both sides of the aisle condemned it strongly.

We will continue to push for a binding vote. Yesterday, the Senate spoke loud and clear by overwhelmingly expressing support for our efforts to ensure Congress plays its appropriate role in the implementation of national security-designated tariffs. TUNE IN: At 10:00 a.m. ET, the #SFRC will hold a hearing on the implications of tariffs for U.S. foreign policy and the international economy.

As we look forward to the upcoming Helsinki summit, the U.S. must stand firmly with our NATO allies and affirm our transatlantic partnership. Doing otherwise strengthens Putin and undermines democratic values.

My statement on the administration's proposal to sell TVA transmission lines: https://t.co/AfN1MsK5zb. I think most Tennesseans would agree that we are fortunate not to have a state income tax, and to help ensure that remains the case, it is important our sales tax system works. Today’s ruling is a win for states’ rights. My full statement: https://t.co/0CMag8nhLe. https://t.co/wT8CHNewtI The president should reverse his decision to implement tariffs under the guise of national security. If he doesn’t, Congress must act and should start by passing our bipartisan legislation. I believe pressure is building in Washington and across the country as American businesses and consumers begin to feel the effects of the administration’s misguided trade policy. This week, I called on the administration to halt family separations, so I am glad the president reversed his position and signed an executive order. We will continue to work toward a long term solution. This is good news for self-employed individuals and the millions of Americans who work for small businesses.

See what they are saying: https://t.co/JJ0MIyszI4. Today, we introduced bipartisan legislation requiring the president to submit to Congress any proposal to adjust imports in the interest of national security under Section 232. Press release and bill text available here: https://t.co/v1vAYz1RrJ If the president truly believes invoking Section 232 is necessary to protect the United States from a genuine threat, he should make the case to Congress and to the American people and do the hard work necessary to secure congressional approval. Making claims regarding national security to justify what is inherently an economic question not only harms the very people we all want to help and impairs relations with our allies but also could invite our competitors to retaliate. While we all agree on the need to ensure the international trade system is fair for American workers, companies and consumers, unfortunately, the administration is abusing the Section 232 authority delegated to the president by Congress. Enjoyed welcoming 100+ Tennesseans to Capitol Hill yesterday at our weekly constituent breakfast.

Will Democrats join us? These two stories feel like something I could have read in a local Caracas newspaper last week, not in America. Venezuela, here WE come! https://t.co/dma8ZdqbrI https://t.co/J3h74DswmM On a quick trip to Haiti this week, I had the opportunity to get a firsthand look at the outstanding work Dr. Mutter and Chattanooga-based @cnphaiti are doing to fight malnutrition and poverty in the country. https://t.co/mOz7b9hPkv RT @USEmbassyHaiti: We thank @SenBobCorker for his decades of public service and fourth visit to Haiti. 

Did you know he has been a champi… Thank you for the warm welcome, @USEmbassyHaiti and @PrimatureHT. https://t.co/WlJoWgFWRj My statement on the administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union: https://t.co/WUX0j1B2x0 I know all Tennesseans join me this #MemorialDay as we honor our men and women in uniform who made the ultimate sacrifice. We are forever grateful for their service. My full statement: https://t.co/qG3KiHZFxk. https://t.co/yIsBm9OkkO I thank @freedomhousedc for honoring me as a symbol of what so many people and organizations are doing to fight modern slavery and human trafficking around the world. @_GFEMS #EndSlaveryAct #enditmovement https://t.co/iGqSUAlmfi https://t.co/n3r8IpEyfd We're home. Honored to greet Josh Holt's parents at the airport. So happy for them. https://t.co/w6YmKRq8h5 My full statement on the release of Josh and Thamy Holt: https://t.co/FsJlzpDy4v I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and President Trump in announcing the release of Josh and Thamy Holt. We are on our way home. https://t.co/0Ku2pzwOYL I am very concerned about the president abusing the authorities granted to him in Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. There is no reason to use this provision to consider imposing tariffs on the automobile industry. My full statement: https://t.co/9WTDX8csIE This morning at 10:00 a.m. ET, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hear testimony from @SecPompeo. Watch live here: https://t.co/yujr5ShWoV. #SFRC I am glad the House has passed our legislation to help reverse some of the overwhelming regulatory burdens Dodd-Frank has placed on community banks and credit unions. I look forward to President Trump signing this legislation into law. My statement: https://t.co/ddMZjqM4l3.

Proud to see these young people taking an interest in public service so early in life. https://t.co/7Bstav36KK It was great to speak with @Rotary members last week to thank them not only for all they have done to eradicate polio around the world but also for their interest in the fight to end modern slavery. #EndSlaveryAct #enditmovement https://t.co/e1q6dbs5e8 For 85 years, the Tennessee Valley Authority has provided low-cost, reliable energy to millions of Tennesseans. Happy anniversary to the largest public power utility in the nation. @TVAnews With more than 30 years of CIA experience, Gina Haspel is qualified to lead the agency and has the experience needed to help address the emerging threats we face globally. My statement on her confirmation as director of the CIA: https://t.co/qaWRJbnRuw. Good discussion with the Tennessee Road Builders Association. We agreed on the need to address the Highway Trust Fund, which is on track to be insolvent in 2020. It is unfortunate that Congress has been unwilling to take steps to create sustainable infrastructure funding. https://t.co/yXkQlJnpfn Great to meet with @TNBankers yesterday and take their questions on a number of topics, including legislation recently passed by the Senate to lessen the regulatory burden on community banks, credit unions, mid-sized banks and regional banks. https://t.co/u0H0KhzPWp Former State Department Legal Adviser Bellinger: “S.J. Res. 59 appropriately balances the need for the president and our military to have a broad and flexible congressional authorization to use force against the terrorist groups that threaten the United States…” Our legislation to replace the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs gives the administration the flexibility necessary to win this fight against terror abroad while strengthening the rightful and necessary role of Congress. My opening statement at today’s #AUMF hearing: https://t.co/0YNhotS2FZ WATCH: Immediately following a 10:00 a.m. ET business meeting to vote on five nominations, the #SFRC will hold a hearing on legislation to replace the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs with an updated #AUMF against al-Qaida, the Taliban, and ISIS. https://t.co/U7KSrSYgyV Great to welcome 70+ Tennesseans to Capitol Hill this morning at our weekly constituent breakfast.

The BUILD Act promotes economic growth that will enable developing countries to stand on their own. Watch my opening statement at last week’s hearing: https://t.co/za5oKxZ1n8 TUNE IN: At 10:00 a.m. ET, the #SFRC will hold a hearing on the BUILD Act, which will provide more accountability for taxpayers, create new opportunities for U.S. businesses to invest overseas, and expand American influence around the world.

You and the entire @newschannelnine family will be in our thoughts in the coming days and weeks. https://t.co/L16nqePPXE I had a good discussion with @wackerchemie executives about the phase-in approach to reopening the Charleston facility. I appreciate their transparency and due diligence to ensure the safety of the community and employees. I look forward to them reaching full capacity very soon. https://t.co/OVnK7LpHf0 This announcement is a prime example of how Tennessee’s business-friendly environment, combined with the pro-growth tax reform legislation I supported on the federal level, has our state firing on all cylinders. My statement on today's announcement: https://t.co/pTBI3dZXuB. https://t.co/RRC7lmgRis I talked to Secretary Pompeo today, and as I said earlier, these new documents confirm what we have known all along: Iran’s claims that their nuclear program has only been peaceful are simply not true. https://t.co/Ul7Pgiz0tH Great discussion yesterday with @CASTLA and @KateBosworth on their important work to provide life-saving services to survivors of human trafficking. #enditmovement #EndSlaveryAct https://t.co/KUgjFEn2yK Mike Pompeo is one of the most outstanding nominees we could have for Secretary of State. I strongly supported his confirmation today, and I look forward to him serving our nation. https://t.co/tjDwRNC5IJ Great privilege to welcome more than 90 Tennesseans to Capitol Hill this morning at our weekly constituent breakfast.

I appreciate my friend @ChrisCoons demonstrating what a true statesman is tonight. The #SFRC has favorably reported the nomination of Mike Pompeo to serve as Secretary of State to the full Senate for consideration. At 5:00 p.m. ET, the #SFRC will hold a business meeting to consider the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. Watch live: https://t.co/VezBspD1Ip. I think all of us look at talks with North Korea with great caution and skepticism. It may lead to something. It may not. It’s important the meeting and the context for it is set up in the appropriate manner. https://t.co/UXQphswJ3Z Our relations with Russia are at the lowest point since the Cuban missile crisis. We should be aware that miscalculations could lead us to a very bad place. And I think that’s why you see Secretary Mattis urging caution. https://t.co/IL3YQtwr1f
