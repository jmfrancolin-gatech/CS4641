I‚Äôd like to send my deepest condolences to my friend @RepDebDingell and the Dingell family during this private time of grieving.

I was blessed to have served with John, and the Dingell family will remain in my prayers. With heavy hearts, we mourn the loss of a legend, Rep. John Dingell. I thank him for dedicating his life to service- U.S. Congress is forever indebted to him for his commitment to ensuring equity in our nation‚Äôs healthcare system, among many other historic legislative feats.

1. Do not discontinue your children‚Äôs benefits, they are not affected by your public charge status.  

2. If you‚Äôre out of the U.S. for more than 6 months at once you can be subject to the public charge test again.

It‚Äôs also important for the community to know that there is no CURRENT penalty for being enrolled in public benefits. Our best tool is to stay informed!‚Äù - Max Hadler #publiccharge Max Hadler, @theNYIC says: The public charge test would be implemented for new green card applications and for ‚Äúadjustment of status‚Äù to any extension or change in a non-immigrant status. #publiccharge We‚Äôre discussing #PublicCharge with experts from @TheNYIC, @undocublack, @BklynDefender, @copousa, and @CWHA_Brooklyn NOW.
