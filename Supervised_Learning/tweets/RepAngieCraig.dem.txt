6M veteran households have children - thousands are forced to reschedule or cancel important VA appointments because they lack childcare. Today I voted for a bill that would eliminate this barrier and ensure reliable childcare for veterans across Minnesota. #ChildCare4Vets https://t.co/Y4kql0mVcI Just gave a floor speech on my commitment to strengthening the middle-class by focusing on issues families across CD2 are talking about around their kitchen tables every night. Watch here: https://t.co/D2yxhhmwn6 Great to talk with the bright, talented Policy Fellows from the Humphrey School to give them an inside look at the policy making process. https://t.co/8NHmuh8HeV I just went to my first @TransportDems hearing where we heard about the urgency of revitalizing our nation’s infrastructure - including testimony from our very own @GovTimWalz! #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/LmLQGJLugg We’re hitting the ground running here in the @HouseAgDems! Looking forward to working with my fellow Minnesotans @RepHagedorn and Rep. Collin Peterson to support family farms across the state. https://t.co/NMxfKv2iH4 I met with @ChildrensMN to hear about the work they are doing to keep Minnesota kids healthy. Making sure every family has access to healthcare is one of my top priorities in Congress, and I’m proud to have such a strong partner working on this issue. https://t.co/v5Wt8sZqwS Great to see the students from Faithful Shepherd Catholic School today! https://t.co/zKERSUw9Gc Access to rural healthcare is one of the biggest challenges facing communities in the 2nd District. I met with folks from the MN Department of Health who are leading the effort to find solutions and make sure everyone, no matter where you live, has access to high quality care. https://t.co/9v522hRonB After tonight’s #SOTU, I’m committed as ever to working hard on behalf of every Minnesotan - to giving every family a fair shot at economic security, high-quality education, and affordable healthcare. My State of the Union guest Katie Brenny and I had a chance to talk about what we hope to hear from the President’s address this evening. https://t.co/gP01HtTyDO I’m on the Agriculture Committee to open up markets for farmers and make sure they can access the resources they were promised in the Farm Bill. I met with @mncorn today to talk about how we can work together to make the voices of Minnesota family farms heard in Washington. https://t.co/6hbAMxOyss Can’t thank Dakota County Commissioners Atkins and Workman enough for a meaningful discussion today. I look forward to being your partner on federal transportation and infrastructure investments and keeping our communities thriving. https://t.co/iXw3SC2OZw I’ll always stand up to put people above politics. That’s exactly what the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act does. #SEASact https://t.co/B3hZ2yXiWf I’m proud to work across the aisle with @RepPeteStauber to ensure the federal government upholds its commitment to funding special education, because all of our students and school communities depend on it. https://t.co/hZkZdWcFi1 Thrilled to Co-Chair @HouseNewDems Healthcare Task Force! I grew up for part of my childhood without access to health insurance. I know it’s time to reduce the cost of health insurance, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and lower the actual cost of healthcare. https://t.co/9zpNRsBzFI I am honored to have Katie Brenny from Mazeppa, MN join me as my guest for this year’s State of the Union. Katie is a cattle farmer, businesswoman, and community advocate, and I could not be more excited to have her representing the Second District this Tuesday. I joined my neighbors for an afternoon of bagging groceries for The Open Door Pantry. Events like these are a great way to get involved in our community. Thank you so much for having me! https://t.co/7osfLhiRlm The weather is warming up - just in time for another great #SmallBusinessSaturday. Thanks @LoonLiquors for sharing your small business success story with me. Let’s work together to keep small businesses thriving across the 2nd district! https://t.co/jTQqHgfOZy I’m glad to see Minnesota dairy farmers will receive the assistance they need through this new program. I look forward to ensuring the program runs smoothly through my position on the Agriculture Committee. https://t.co/kiNsShzaRJ I am proud to be a champion for strengthening Social Security. I signed on as an original cosponsor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which would strengthen economic security for our seniors and keep this vital program financially stable for generations to come. #Secure2100 https://t.co/S4I7MmBzEn Yesterday I gave a floor speech on the #SEASact, a bill I introduced that prevents future shutdowns by shifting the financial burden of a shutdown from federal employees to Congress and Executive Branch officials. https://t.co/O4YtlZjq5b I’m about to talk with @Pdouglasweather and @JordanaWCCO on @WCCORadio. Listen here: https://t.co/jxjOHF4cyj Thanks so much to President Shelley Buck and Cody Whitebear from Prairie Island Indian Community for meeting with me today. I look forward to continuing to work together to strengthen our tribal communities across Minnesota. https://t.co/tnHJuuLXd6 I’m an original cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which was introduced in Congress today. It’s long past time to strengthen working families by ensuring a woman receives the pay she deserves for doing the same job as the man working next to her. #EqualPay Due to the exceptionally cold weather, my Burnsville office is closed, but we are still available by phone at (651) 846-2120. We will be back open for walk-ins on Thursday from 9am to 5pm. Please stay safe! It’s time to end shutdowns forever. I just joined my fellow freshmen to introduce the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act - a bill to say NO to putting politics above people! #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact https://t.co/QUUHEkwrVl I’m back in Washington this week to ensure that no party ever shuts down the government over a policy dispute again. Hardworking federal workers and their families deserve better. Today we remember and honor the millions of lives lost. My wife’s great-grandfather, a rabbi who immigrated from Poland to England as a young man, lost his entire family during the Holocaust. #NeverAgain #HolocaustRemembranceDay Thank you to everyone who joined me yesterday at my first Town Hall. I’ve been reading your comment cards and I couldn’t be more honored to represent you in Washington. I look forward to continuing our conversation.
https://t.co/1mVk0QrFrV I had the joy of spending #SmallBusinessSaturday at Family Salon in Cannon Falls. Thanks Annette for talking with me about your 25 years contributing to our local economy. I look forward to continuing our conversation. https://t.co/FyPv1bPKDp Thank you to the outstanding Burnsville High School students who joined me today at my very first Town Hall! This event was a huge success thanks to your help. https://t.co/RRPBdtp5aO Wonderful to spend the morning hearing from my neighbors in the Second District on everything from healthcare to clean energy. I am excited to continue working for you in Washington. https://t.co/aUT6T878HT I’m excited for my first Town Hall - which starts in two hours (11 am) at Burnsville High School. I’m looking forward to a meaningful conversation and hope to see you there! Remember to join me tomorrow at 11 am for my first Town Hall at Burnsville High School! I am looking forward to sharing what I’ve been working on in Washington and hear about the issues impacting our communities. Sign up here → https://t.co/z5ALBkAiJe It’s good news that the government is finally opening. The shutdown caused far too much pain for our federal employees. I’ll do everything I can to make sure this never happens again. So many mayors in DC this week! Great to see you @MayorCarter_ ! https://t.co/nILfI2APzW Excited for my Subcommittee assignments for @HouseAgDems:
-General Farm Commodities &amp; Risk Management

-Railroads, Pipelines &amp; Hazardous Materials
I’ll be fighting hard for investment in our highways and bridges, to keep our water clean and our skies safe! Good to talk to the folks at Southwest News Media about my leadership on a campaign finance reform bill, supporting family farms, and improving funding for education and job training in the Second District. https://t.co/IKefFtmPQz I just voted on a bipartisan bill to #EndTheShutdown now. This was the 10th time the House has voted to open the government. Minnesotans need certainty that they can pay their mortgages and put food on the table with the paychecks they have earned.
https://t.co/XpYiZipOsw Thanks to my friend @Jacob_Frey for stopping by the office today! https://t.co/20JQ8f8eyo Good Morning!

Sign up here ⬇️ https://t.co/9pcVwBrfq4 https://t.co/ZfOO7fhG0F Every day The Open Door puts our community first by providing healthy food to our neighbors in need. Today, I joined them to volunteer to serve our community in honor of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. https://t.co/bAuaL8r4GS Honored to speak at the Red Wing MLK Day breakfast and celebration held in Dr. King's honor. It was wonderful to be in the 2nd District as we reflect on the strength of our communities, progress we’ve made, and the work yet to be completed to continue his legacy of service. https://t.co/rheCX8Zgyr Thank you for joining me and the team yesterday at our district office in Burnsville! Stop by during the week to get to know the staff - and let them know how they can help.

If you’re looking for something adorable to brighten your Sunday – look no further than Summitt, an Eagan native, and a proud second district resident. https://t.co/kdpOlcVuJR Thank you @thebuzzcafe411 for letting me spend #SmallBusinessSaturday with you. Jasmine is waiting for the government to reopen so she can get her small business loan and expand her business. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/bTUoUU18eO I hope to see you this afternoon at my district office open house! Stop by anytime between 2 and 4 pm. 🏢 12940 Harriet Avenue South, Suite 238, Burnsville, MN 55337

Remember to bring a non perishable food item for local food shelves! Thank you @GovTimWalz for prioritizing the needs of Minnesotans during the shutdown. We have been working to immediately reopen the government, and we will keep working tirelessly to make sure our constituents have access to the relief they need during these uncertain times. https://t.co/Sc5X6C9CMr I joined @BettyMcCollum04 to meet with federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay. I’ve voted 8 times to #EndTheShutdown and joined colleagues to hand deliver a letter to Leader McConnell urging him to pass these bipartisan bills and reopen the government now! https://t.co/AojzukLA3u Hi everyone! I will be back in D.C. next week working to end this shutdown. 

As a result, I’ve rescheduled my first Town Hall to Saturday, Jan. 26th at 11:00am! I look forward to hearing from you! https://t.co/38bkrMIenP I am thrilled to be named to serve on the House Committees on @HouseAgDems and @TransportDems! I will work tirelessly to make sure we listen to family farmers and partner with cities and towns to keep our communities thriving. I just joined about 30 colleagues to hand deliver a letter to Leader McConnell urging the Senate to take up the bills we've passed and #EndTheShutdown immediately. https://t.co/BzHkwoyFhd I've talked to many hard-working federal employees who work and live in the Second District about the hardships this shutdown has caused for their families. 

Have you been affected by the shutdown? Tell me below or share your stories here → https://t.co/r6Ytedpn8b Join me on Saturday, January 19th from 2:00 to 4:00 pm at my District Office - 12940 Harriet Avenue South, Suite 238, Burnsville, MN 55337. 

We will be collecting non-perishable food donations for local food banks. Bring an item to share! https://t.co/d9JwBW5Yyf I’m an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act because it’s long past time to strengthen working families by ensuring a woman receives the pay she deserves for doing the same job as the man working next to her. This is what leadership looks like. I'm honored and humbled to work alongside such an impressive and dedicated group of women. Let's get to work. https://t.co/cjL9vDBp5V Back in D.C., enjoying the snow and fighting to reopen the government - put hardworking federal employees back to work, restore pay for thousands of Minnesotans and end the hardship and uncertainty this shutdown has caused for millions. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/45LTLl2hv2 I visited with staff at Fairview Hospital in Burnsville today. So good to meet with the folks helping to keep the Second District healthy and talk with them about controlling costs and delivering great care to Minnesotans. https://t.co/AOI2x45Zst I’ll be talking to @RoshiniR on @wccoradio in just a few minutes. Tune in here →https://t.co/1ykQwWEYVJ It’s a wonderful #SmallBusinessSaturday. Got the chance to stop by Quaint and Quirky in Hastings and visit with Jodi, the owner. Even picked up a new piece of art for my office. https://t.co/T9HKLFgdCS A productive conversation with Hastings Mayor Mary Fasbender about this fantastic community. Infrastructure, housing, and health care are all priorities. Can’t wait to work with you, Mary! https://t.co/k9Hrh9mJf2 I just signed onto a bill that makes sure that Congress doesn’t get paid if the government is shut down. Until we get the government back up and running, it’s just wrong for us to be paid while federal workers struggle to pay their bills. https://t.co/RPMJJIQa6u Today thousands of Minnesotans are missing their paychecks because of the shutdown. That’s unacceptable. We should not be playing political games with people’s lives. We need to #EndThisShutdown. I just gave my first floor speech about the stories I heard from Minnesotans keeping our skies safe impacted by the shutdown. https://t.co/ikP94JDGYp Today I voted to reopen the government and make sure that no farmers are denied the relief they rely on, and no family or child in Minnesota goes hungry. We must end this shutdown now. I voted today to end the shutdown so families aren’t at the risk of being evicted. This shutdown has caused too much uncertainty for Minnesotans. I’m excited to kick off my first town hall meeting on Thursday, January 24th at 7:00 pm at Burnsville High School. See you there! Sign up here: https://t.co/5hU9qnC5qX I’m proud to work with thoughtful, hardworking colleagues from Minnesota regardless of party. Let’s work hard for the people of this state to find common ground! https://t.co/5zd4QgmyCD I joined my colleagues and voted to protect health care today, including Minnesotans with pre-existing conditions, by intervening in the TX Court's unconstitutional ruling. #ProtectOurCare Thanks @MNcounties for visiting with me in Washington. I look forward to working with you and I’m proud to represent six of MN’s best counties – Dakota, Goodhue, Scott, Wabasha (and parts of) Rice and Washington! https://t.co/3XgqaacXd7 It’s an honor to be here with @GabbyGiffords. It’s time that we pass common-sense gun safety legislation to make our communities safer. https://t.co/rytO6y507E Always happy to say hello in the second district - thanks for letting me stop by the St. Paul Park City Council meeting last night! https://t.co/c4NX2DT5Ha 5,280 hardworking Minnesotans are not getting their paychecks. It's time to end this shutdown now. https://t.co/FZcuCIdHof I won't accept a paycheck during this or any shutdown where federal employees are not being paid and services are limited to Americans. I’ll be donating my salary to Eagan Open Door Pantry and Wabasha Food Shelf. I just met with air traffic controllers in CD2 who are not being paid because of the shutdown. It’s time to put an end to this senseless shutdown, pay our federal employees and give Americans the certainty they deserve. https://t.co/ICC1Mq1OhH Congratulations to my friends @GovTimWalz and @LtGovFlanagan on your swearing-in today! I know you will be tireless champions for MInnesota and I’m looking forward to working with you to move our great state forward. https://t.co/Ts6H2FHMQK The inauguration is off to an excellent start with Prior Lake High School’s Wind Ensemble! https://t.co/Hd0ecGDlRv We must end this shutdown now and provide certainty that hard-working families will receive their tax refunds on time, that farmers get the relief they are counting on and that federal workers again get paid for their work. I believe that Americans deserve an effective, efficient and modern government that reflects the many advancements we’ve made over the years. That’s why I voted to establish a special House committee to make sure this is a top priority for this Congress. In December I helped introduce the framework for the For The People Act, H.R. 1, and today I signed on as a cosponsor to fight to take the dark money out of politics, restore confidence in our government and make sure that your voices are heard. RT @RepAngieCraig: My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans… My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans to go back to work and restore their pay. Now it's up to the Senate to do their job. On the first day of the 116th Congress, the House passed the first step toward restoring our fiscal responsibility. I will always fight to make sure Congress spends tax dollars wisely. Today, I was sworn into the 116th Congress. It’s our job to work to ensure every Minnesotan has access to affordable, quality health care, to invest in the infrastructure of our communities and to prioritize career skills and technical education again. https://t.co/MUcgQMLnQa Hello! My official twitter account @RepAngieCraig is live. I'll be sharing my work in Congress with you here.
