I won't let them off the hook! https://t.co/K11Esx0gHG CBS, the efforts on your website about your support for diversity fly in the face of your display of all of the reporters you've selected for the 2020 campaign. Not one Black. What's up with this? An explanation is needed. Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise &amp; now you want to declare an emergency. The only emergency facing our country is the need to impeach you before you destroy our country, our ideals, &amp; leadership in the world. Trump, go home. Bye bye! Back in 2017, I dubbed Trump &amp; his allies w/ all their ties to Russia and Ukraine, the "Kremlin Klan".

He meets w/ Putin 5 times in secret w/ no readout; gave Russians classified info in WH; disregarded US intel on Russia; praised Putin's election; lies abt his deals in Russia. Is there any question Trump is a Russian agent? Trump has perfected the art of lying. No, #ConManDon, the FBI investigation hanging over your head is no witch hunt. You are engulfed in a web of lies &amp; deceit. Webs are created by poisonous &amp; dangerous spiders. You fit the profile. Please. No one should wonder why Manafort gave polling data to Russians. The only reason Russians wanted this info was to use it against H. Clinton in support of Trump. Why do you think Manafort w/ all his ties to Russia &amp; Ukraine was in the campaign to begin with? Stay woke! Americans should be shaken by what we know of Trump &amp; Putin's relationship &amp; should NOT be surprised by the FBI counterintelligence investigation. Is Trump a Russian agent? If it walks like a duck &amp; talks like a duck, then it is a duck - and the duck should be impeached. Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, &amp; the children need shoes.

A true American patriot &amp; hero has passed. 
John McCain was an example of a public policy maker who fought for what he believed in, and had the character &amp; dignity to stand up for what was right -- even if he had to oppose some of his colleagues to do so. Manafort &amp; Cohen both lied about their finances &amp; cheated the IRS. Can you imagine what #DonTheCon must be hiding in his tax returns when it is well known that the ONLY bank that would lend him money, Deutsche, is notorious for money laundering? The avg. American struggles to pay his/her taxes but Trump's allies can get by for years cheating the IRS, defrauding banks, &amp; laundering millions of $$. Trump is probably hiding his tax returns b/c he's as big a crook &amp; fraud as the top people he chose to run his campaign &amp; WH. The high crimes are giving aid and classified information to our enemies (Russia), abusing the pardon, breaking campaign finance laws, working w/ Russians to get "dirt" on political opponents, and coming soon from Special Counsel Mueller, obstruction of justice. Cohen admitted Trump instructed him to break the law. If it's a crime for Cohen, it's a crime for Trump.  Debates about whether you can indict a president do not excuse Congress from its responsibility to impeach Trump for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes &amp; misdemeanors." Cohen said he would take a bullet for Trump. I guess he never said anything about jail time! Recently, my friend Aretha sent me beautiful flowers with the message ‚ÄúJust Because.‚Äù
