However, this sentiment must go beyond one month. We must ensure they are respected, honored, and supported always. https://t.co/RHDYSwhu6H RT @SpeakerRyan: Another üí™ week for our economy:

We are all with you, Jack! https://t.co/nLd8vDa5ZO RT @HouseGOP: #TaxReform 2.0 has PASSED the House. These critical bills will:

‚úì Provide financial secu‚Ä¶ After several years of sluggish growth, tax reform has jumpstarted our economy. We've seen bigger paychecks and many new jobs created. That's I voted to keep up that momentum and make middle-class and small business tax cuts permanent. The front gate of the long-awaited Pikes Peak National Cemetery is complete and construction on the remainder of the cemetery is well under way. More importantly, the VA announced that first burials are expected to start the first week in November. https://t.co/JsRsKsgNl0 I was honored to receive the Guardian of Small Business award from @NFIB. 

Small businesses are vital to our economy, and small business owners play an important role in our communities. I will always work here in Congress to protect Main Street and stand up for their interests. https://t.co/NISe0VelEs The American people want to make #taxcuts permanent. Congress is answering that call with Tax Reform 2.0 https://t.co/iJgvLefSru RT @HouseGOP: Have you heard? Democrats are committed to raising taxes and rolling back all of the tax cuts that you and your family have b‚Ä¶ Tonight I voted no on the Cromnibus. Although the bill boosts defense spending, it is combined with the spending priorities of Democrats. That means: no border wall funding ‚ùå no pro-life policies ‚ùå and no conservative wins. This is not a good deal for the American people. Taxpayer dollars should never fund companies that sell baby body parts for profit. The abortion industry does not deserve our money. https://t.co/HpHWmZMgNc The Trump Administration has ended a contract with a company that harvested fetal tissue from aborted babies. 

This is a great step in the right direction of completely halting federal funding from supporting this grotesque practice. https://t.co/lF5kXKwa4z Organizations are trying to force faith-based adoption and foster care providers to forsake their beliefs. But Keep Kids First is a coalition devoted to standing with these providers and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to find a home for good. https://t.co/1a6TruZqQm When the government punishes faith-based adoption agencies because of their beliefs, it punishes innocent kids. Kids come first. So why is the government doing this? Learn why at https://t.co/nprZSw7BOk #KeepKidsFirst This morning, I met with @SecAFOfficial to share why Colorado Springs is the best place in the country to headquarter Space Command. Local defense leaders and I laid out the reasons that our district has so much to offer in terms of national defense space. https://t.co/1VL1kBKKjB RT @HouseGOP: Feeling the positive benefits of #taxreform isn't  limited to a geographical location.
