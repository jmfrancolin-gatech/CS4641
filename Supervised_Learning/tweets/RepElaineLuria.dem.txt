Great guide to #BlackHistoryMonth events happening in Hampton Roads. https://t.co/ws5KbYCIfh Medal of Honor recipients and Prisoners of War are among America’s bravest heroes. I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation to ensure we properly remember their dedication, courage, and sacrifice. 

https://t.co/HoVNYwlLwW Joint Statement from Representatives Elaine Luria, @RepSpanberger, @RepWexton, @RepDonBeyer, and @GerryConnolly Calling on Lieutenant Governor Fairfax to Resign https://t.co/sbQwujc1nr Extraordinarily proud of our Portsmouth-based, life-saving @USCG heroes – and so happy they are back home safe. https://t.co/tpoYuBICFE “This is what children need to see, how their ancestors struggled to make [life] better for them and that they have a proud heritage.” Check out this terrific story about three women working hard to bring the past to life #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/eExleZ6X9t Veterans should never be forced to choose between seeking medical care for themselves or their children. Proud to have cosponsored the #ChildCare4Vets Act, which passed the House today. https://t.co/na6S7Ti4q9 RT @CraigCaplan: VA Democratic Senators Warner &amp; Kaine and Reps. Scott, Connolly, Beyer, McEachin, Luria, Spanberger and Wexton issue state… My heart goes out to @RepDebDingell and the entire Dingell family. Rep. John Dingell was a force for good in Congress. America will miss his wit, wisdom, and passion for public service. https://t.co/Qpm7vshjmh In February 1944, the Navy commissioned its first African-American officers. The 12 commissioned officers, plus a warrant officer who received his rank at the same time, came to be known as The Golden Thirteen. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/tYmnoBTgRx Great that experts, academics, nonprofits, city officials, and others met this week in Williamsburg to brainstorm and discuss how policymakers can translate established science into action. We cannot ignore rising sea levels any longer. #VA02 https://t.co/CYoMyG5mYO Looking forward to working with @RepJoeCourtney and @RobWittman to produce bipartisan results for our military on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. https://t.co/R2ZrPgJPPf Congress must examine gun violence and work to advance legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. As a proud cosponsor of #HR8, I’m glad @HouseJudiciary is holding hearings and #TakingAction on this issue. Watch live here: https://t.co/mLmzBNBtGE I am encouraged that President Trump said he wants to work with Democrats on building up America’s infrastructure, lowering the price of prescription drugs, and honoring our military and veterans. So let’s get to work on these issues for the good of the American people. #SOTU Founded in 1868, @_HamptonU was among the first educational institutions established for African-Americans. On campus, visit the Emancipation Oak, believed to be the place where Lincoln’s famous proclamation was first read in the South. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/9lq5iJwpw1 Terrible news out of Farmville — one of our bravest individuals died as he worked to keep Virginia safe. My heart goes out to Trooper Dowell’s family and friends. https://t.co/7FnUcfdzZ3 Loved checking in with the great staff — plus cats, dogs, and other furry friends — at the Virginia Beach Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. https://t.co/Ux5o4BYLiY Great meeting last Friday with leadership of Senior Services of Southeastern Virginia to discuss how to improve the lives of our outstanding #VA02 seniors. https://t.co/8Fya6ZDQ1i Wonderful celebrating #ChineseNewYear over the weekend with #VA02 friends at Tallwood High in Virginia Beach! https://t.co/kdX0QdAKVk “Frederick Douglass started out on the Eastern Shore [MD], watching sailboats go by. That captured his imagination on the topic of freedom.” Check out this great @DailyPress article on Nathan Richardson, an inspiration to our community. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/8xWxbVA9Kj With jurisdiction over maritime programs, shipbuilding, and more, the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee is crucial to the Hampton Roads community. https://t.co/4CW2UiwTy8 Looking forward to serving as Vice Chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces! I’m proud to take leadership roles that will produce bipartisan solutions for active-duty military and veterans. https://t.co/n4PIgQrqmE I ask Governor Northam to resign. This isn’t about politics, this is about what is right and wrong. We need leaders who will bring us together instead of driving us apart. While it was proper for Governor Northam to apologize, there is no excuse for this type of photograph then or now. Unfortunately, the existence of this photograph does not bring us together. Deciding to withdraw from the INF treaty is a mistake. It would endanger our national security, insult our NATO allies, and hand a victory to President Putin. The last thing our world needs is a new arms race. https://t.co/yLwTecoxux Today I visited a dialysis clinic in Virginia Beach and later met with the Southeastern Virginia Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association in Norfolk. Learned a lot about difficult medical challenges and discussed how Congress can preserve quality, affordable health care #VA02 https://t.co/VnVAKXuBM8 Enjoyed speaking and visiting with friends last night at the Annual Meeting of the Greater Williamsburg Chamber and Tourism Alliance. Every American should visit Williamsburg and learn our rich history! https://t.co/QADRqmjxbF As #BlackHistoryMonth begins today, we remember the great progress made toward equality, thank those who made that progress possible, and recommit to the work that remains to be done. Last month, I voted for the bipartisan @NATO Support Act, which easily passed the House. Our nation is safer and stronger when we honor our relationships with our allies. I was proud to meet last weekend with General André Lanata (SACT) in Norfolk – NATO’S home in North America. https://t.co/ZzllGwppJd https://t.co/oQvK40i00R Great news! Lots to see and do in #VA02: https://t.co/D80BfJ5HC9 #ESVA Congress has a lot to do in modernizing the disability claims process and helping our veterans get the benefits they deserve. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to fight for them. As a veteran, I am honored to lead the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs and help our American heroes succeed after their service. https://t.co/9YUjuhqFcn I was happy to support a pay raise our federal workers deserve. They should never be used as political pawns again. https://t.co/J1tDZSMKHH Federal employees protect our children, patrol our borders, secure our flights, beautify our parks, clean our air, inspect our food, purify our water, staff our museums, help the hungry, house the homeless, and much, much more. https://t.co/jgrsxkzRv4 I’m serving in Congress to ensure equality for my daughter and every American woman. Ten years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law, women are still battling the wage gap. Pay discrimination has no place in America. Proud to support the #PaycheckFairnessAct Thanks to @hearsayradio and @CathyLewisTalks for speaking with me about my first few weeks in Congress! #VA02 Click here to listen: https://t.co/K4gGxtuMyG https://t.co/Sl2RkwvdC2 I support an orderly, deliberate, and thorough debate on border security between Congress and the President. https://t.co/89uJ8OGe4M Today’s committee testimony illustrated that we haven’t examined every element of border security, including combating the flow of drugs at sea. https://t.co/dIVmetKpep Great visit today with @HamptonCSchools Board Member @MarthaMugler and @nnschools Board Member @shelly_simonds in Washington! https://t.co/1p45HQPmHL "Fire-Rescue Chief Jeffrey Wise to Retire after 40 Years of Service" https://t.co/fXhLaTw7aV Two of Norfolk’s finest protectors are headed into well-deserved retirement. Congratulations to @NorfolkFireResc Chief Jeffrey Wise and @NorfolkPolice Capt. W.R. Driskell Jr.! Our city thanks you both for your distinguished careers in public service. https://t.co/VBBZeqvu5o .@RepWalterJones is a bipartisan lawmaker who goes out of his way to work across the aisle. My heart goes out to Congressman Jones and his family. https://t.co/rfLufFeMSY My district is home to eight major military installations representing all branches of our great Armed Forces. I will be a vocal advocate for everyone fighting for our country. I am honored to serve on these subcommittees so I can dig into the details, strengthen our military readiness, and improve quality of life for all service members. https://t.co/jSDLMlC3nt Today is #HolocaustMemorialDay. We commemorate the victims of brutal prejudice and intolerance. Let’s never stop working to reject anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination. https://t.co/wiA3cAhTfQ Productive meeting late last week with Col. Patrick Kinsman at the Norfolk District of the @USACEHQ. Learned a lot about key projects, environmental impact, and public engagement in our region. https://t.co/tdciUCJaYI Enjoyed seeing brave @USCG families &amp; loading groceries at the Help for Hampton Roads Coast Guard Families Food Drive in Chesapeake. Big thanks to the Chief Petty Officers Association, volunteers, and Vertical Real Estate for opening their offices to host this important event. https://t.co/cLajqwMnZY Enjoyed meeting with Rear Admiral Chip Rock yesterday to discuss the importance of Navy installations to #VA02’s robust military capability. https://t.co/STa0fj8Qrv https://t.co/UnHToHzBSn My full statement on today’s news: https://t.co/tTzwxAYEp8 .@RepWexton, @RepSpeier, @RepMaloney, @RepSpanberger and I sent a letter to @SpeakerCox yesterday urging House action on #ERA. Virginia has a historic chance to ratify and give American women equal protection in the Constitution! https://t.co/9dvpgeHk9R 35 days – absurdly long, completely unacceptable, and long past time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/9Xk65NEhFf https://t.co/hl1jIziK6M Please share with any #VA02 federal employees affected by this senseless shutdown. 

"Norfolk Offers Part-Time Employment Opportunities to Furloughed Federal Employees" 

https://t.co/8uyi1bQB0f Congress and the President need to come together to reopen government and get people back to work. Then we can hear from the experts, debate evidence-based immigration policies, and work on smart bipartisan reform. https://t.co/MjQvrhHsoF We feel this proposal would gain support across the aisle, allow a transparent process, and encourage much-needed reforms to our immigration system. This Congress didn’t cause the shutdown, but it’s our job to fix it. I’m proud to lead an effort to #EndTheShutdown and find common ground. Effective governing shouldn't result in winners and losers -- our job is to do the most good for the most people. https://t.co/JBHDxo7Ury RT @ComdtUSCG: Your Coast Guard leadership team &amp; the American people stand in awe of your continued dedication to duty, resilience, &amp; that… Saddened to hear of the passing of Judge Robert Hagans. His service to the City of Virginia Beach will be remembered. Keeping his family and friends in my prayers. https://t.co/Jb6cTpb7QT Working hard to end the longest government shutdown in American history. https://t.co/r535E2RgTv Another rescue by @USCG as they work without pay during the 32-day shutdown. Due to the shutdown, routine patrols are curtailed and the Coast Guard is only responding to search-and-rescue missions. I support a House bill that would pay the Coast Guard now. https://t.co/VRmRx6ZCAq The shutdown is hurting research efforts around Hampton Roads. New proposals can’t be submitted and existing projects are stalled. I have voted 9 times to reopen all or parts of our government.  It’s long past time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/pj7TRAcZgZ So many Virginians have served honorably &amp; put their lives on the line for America, yet they have difficulty accessing the care they were promised. Being on this committee gives me a unique opportunity to advocate for my fellow veterans, and I’m honored to fight on their behalf. I am honored to announce my appointment to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As a 20-year Navy veteran and the spouse of a 27-year veteran, I know firsthand the challenges of receiving care and services through the Department of Veterans Affairs. https://t.co/tuFm3oxTZS Wonderful visiting with friends at the 8th Annual Virginia Beach Interdenominational Ministers Conference Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast. The health of our community depends on the strength of our faith community. https://t.co/V8AMCPKPxs Pastor John Blanchard of Rock Church gave a heartfelt invocation at this morning’s breakfast. #ULHRMLK https://t.co/4yvZ3vPAP0 Glad to be with Delegate @jonesjay and Norfolk City Treasurer @DaunHester! #ULHRMLK https://t.co/Q6y7nr3GNS Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and celebrating his legacy at the 35th Annual MLK Community Leaders’ Breakfast in Norfolk today. Dr. King’s selfless service, community activism, and civil rights heroism made America great. #ULHRMLK https://t.co/scvlLjcLYu The Coast Guard is our wall at sea. Readiness is eroding as training &amp; maintenance are deferred during the shutdown. Whether the future mission is counter-narcotics, weather response, or countering trafficking, the Coast Guard’s operations will be riskier because of the shutdown. https://t.co/UcIJWZYRgv Great news for Norfolk! https://t.co/Oymate4456 My deepest condolences to the brave Americans who lost their lives in Syria this week.  Chief Petty Officer Kent had previously been assigned to Navy Special Warfare Support Activity 2 in Norfolk.  Their sacrifices will never be forgotten.  https://t.co/VCHv3i3ZkU Senate Republicans should do the sensible thing and pass bipartisan House legislation to reopen government immediately. Failing that, our top priority in Congress should be making it easier for federal workers to pay their bills and live their lives. Our federal workforce should be able to access their hard-earned money during disruptive political breakdowns they had no role in causing.  Throughout this shutdown, Virginians have contacted my office with stories of lengthy furlough periods or working without pay. Proud to introduce my first bill, joined by a bipartisan group of 11 original cosponsors. The Shutdown Relief Act would provide relief to federal workers suffering from the financial repercussions of the government shutdown. Read more here: https://t.co/tgGG5ivcfO Today I was on @CNN to discuss the importance of visiting our troops in Afghanistan. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I take seriously my responsibility to listen, learn, and deliver for our service members in harm's way. https://t.co/nVDGhwduFV Oversight is the responsibility of Congress, and it is inappropriate for the President to interfere with our constitutional duties. As a 20-year Navy veteran, new member of the House Armed Services Committee, and new member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, it is my duty to support our troops and learn everything I can about their mission. The President’s comment that lawmakers visiting Afghanistan is a “public relations event” is an insult to the brave men and women serving in harm’s way. https://t.co/qAH4XMaoYj Proud to join Rep. @BobbyScott as an original cosponsor to #RaiseTheWage! https://t.co/PsaZyNeLMT Terrific news for Virginia.  Hopeful that the House quickly follows the Senate’s lead so America can ratify #ERANow https://t.co/76LALsMQyR Senate Republicans won’t budge and refuse to pass House legislation that would open all of government.  As they stall, I have voted for individual bills to reopen &amp; fund:

✅ Treasury Department &amp; IRS
✅ Agriculture Department &amp; FDA
✅ FAA &amp; HUD
✅ National parks, museums, EPA “For the first time, more than 100 women serve in the House of Representatives.” https://t.co/mjy2LBD6bv Our warfighters need proper equipment, training, and funding so they can succeed in their missions to defend America. I will work every day to make sure our nation lives up to its values, and that our most courageous Americans are treated with dignity and respect. As a 20-year Navy veteran, I am honored to serve on the House Armed Services Committee. These are difficult times in a dangerous world, and our brave service members in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District and across America deserve our strongest support. https://t.co/w6GpN4Q8Tf Today would have been Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 90th birthday.  This afternoon I voted to support a House resolution rejecting white nationalism and white supremacy.  Neither ideology belongs in America. Nearly 42,000 active duty @USCG members, including thousands in #VA02, are missing a paycheck today.  I support bipartisan legislation that would restore pay to the Coast Guard during the shutdown. https://t.co/7w2OEuogV3 Today I was proud to meet with Kathleen, a @NatWICAssoc breastfeeding peer counselor from the Peninsula.  We in Congress need to do everything possible so that women have the proper facilities, equipment, and support to nourish their babies. https://t.co/ROKKRoTVXb https://t.co/AzF5EDQXAx https://t.co/rBcSd7eGTk https://t.co/VNCXPNthkF https://t.co/XUR1n7aRO3 More shameful real-world consequences of the longest federal government shutdown in history: https://t.co/jXplX1XQnv My staff greatly enjoyed meeting with high school students from Norfolk and Virginia Beach to discuss climate change and how it affects #VA02.  It’s never too early to contact your representatives and speak up on important issues.  Thank you all for coming by! https://t.co/udOm5SV9vj Honored to join @RepCunningham and at least nine other freshman House members with backgrounds in science, medicine, or technology. I make decisions after evaluating data and objective research, and I’m proud to take that approach to Congress.  https://t.co/B9Sqnfw2Ob Glad to attend Wave Church in Virginia Beach on the momentous occasion of its 20th anniversary! https://t.co/nxRWkHeAab Great visit yesterday with @_HamptonU leadership.  Toured the university’s Proton Therapy Institute.  So inspiring to meet with our region’s researchers and learn about their efforts to treat cancer. https://t.co/eIvmZlInZw Our brave Coast Guard is the only service branch working without pay during the shutdown.  Today I met with Coast Guard members at @USCG Station Little Creek in Virginia Beach.  I thank them for their service and support a bipartisan bill to reinstate their salaries – now. https://t.co/6DboDaWAJE .@TSA staff missed a paycheck yesterday thanks to the 22-day shutdown.  Today I met with @NorfolkAirport agents.  I won’t take a dollar of my pay until they &amp; other federal employees are made whole.  Senate Republicans should follow the House’s lead &amp; vote to fund the government. https://t.co/07qpqPsaTT Today in Hampton, I enjoyed attending the 34th annual Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast, hosted by the Virginia Peninsula Education Foundation &amp; Delta Beta Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. Always a pleasure seeing friends &amp; my colleague Rep. @BobbyScott! https://t.co/0hwABJ9qGB Earlier this week I enjoyed touring the Virginia Seafood Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Hampton with Mayor @DonnieTuck! Our seafood and aquaculture industries are vital to economic development in #VA02. https://t.co/ArWOi5s6WS Today is Human Trafficking Awareness Day.  Trafficking happens worldwide, but we see it all too often in the Hampton Roads region.  I’m thankful for every advocate and lawmaker working to help brave survivors and eliminate the problem for good. https://t.co/849tc20YRm To Coast Guard members protecting us in #VA02 and all over America — as a Navy veteran, I’ll keep fighting and I stand with you to the end of this mess.  https://t.co/UbaliTUM8Q If Senate Republicans refuse to open government, Congress should stay in Washington this weekend to pass new bipartisan legislation I’ve cosponsored to fund our Coast Guard.  https://t.co/xFoSzvOvu0 Shutdown, Day 21.   Our Coast Guard continues to work without pay.  The Coast Guard is the only service branch operating without pay during the shutdown.  Families in my district are struggling.  https://t.co/EJR3tI5H6N RT @SenDuckworth: Enjoyed having lunch with these inspiring public servants who have protected our nation and I'm excited to work with them… The Coast Guard falls under the Department of Homeland Security, so it is the only service branch currently running without funding during the shutdown. We rely on our brave Coast Guard to provide maritime safety, security, and stewardship.  Members of our maritime security service need to put food on the table, fill their gas tanks, and pay their rent or mortgage.  They should never bear the burden of political breakdowns. #VA02 Proud to be an original cosponsor of new bipartisan legislation that would ensure United States Coast Guard members are paid during the duration of the government shutdown. https://t.co/zsvxrjnKua The 20-day shutdown has gone on far too long.  Yesterday I voted for a House bill that would reopen the Treasury Dept. and Internal Revenue Service to ensure that Virginians receive their tax refunds in-full and on time.  I call on Senate Republicans to quickly follow suit. Today I voted to protect Virginia’s historic Medicaid expansion &amp; overall access to affordable health care.  Our focus should be lowering health care costs &amp; the price of prescription drugs – not gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/PNxWPMecvp Shutdown, Day 19.  Families are hurting.  Nearly 30K Virginians — Coast Guard members, TSA staff, and more — are furloughed or working without pay.  That’s why I’ve directed the Chief Administrative Officer of the House to withhold my pay until federal employees are made whole. https://t.co/bKduAOgKjQ Tonight the President said it’s “immoral” to “do nothing,” but the House has passed bipartisan legislation that would open government.  It’s long past time for this 18-day shutdown to end.  Our Coast Guard, TSA, and other federal workers shouldn’t be hostages in political fights. Proud to join @MarkWarner and @timkaine in support of funding for the rehabilitation of a section of @ColonialParkNPS. The project would address safety and flooding concerns, improve access to sites like Jamestown and Yorktown Battlefield, and extend the life of Colonial Parkway. https://t.co/tuPcVf1Kdk Thrilled and honored to be part of this new Congress. Now more than ever, the House looks like the people it represents — including more than 100 women Members. Look for me at the top, closest to the Capitol! #VA02 https://t.co/vyUzGYexrJ In about two months, Hampton Roads will have the largest cranes on the East Coast! A big investment as our port grows to accommodate more cargo. https://t.co/KHsiURQGKq Topics included timeliness of care; care during transition from active duty; and making care more accessible to veterans on the Eastern Shore. I’m proud to advocate for my fellow veterans in #VA02. https://t.co/2s0Pbin64o Back in #VA02 after being sworn in last week, and honored to spend time meeting with J. Ronald Johnson, Director of the Hampton VA Medical Center. Productive discussion about how to improve care for 55,000+ veterans annually. https://t.co/CeWbwlql5V Our Coast Guard, border security agents, and TSA staff are working without pay. This is completely unacceptable. See below for the real-world consequences. https://t.co/clrTDdPvE5 A years-long shutdown is absurd. Last night the House passed legislation that would reopen government. The Senate and White House should do their jobs. https://t.co/n6L9trg6Yk An unforgettable first day representing #VA02 in Congress. Voted to reopen the federal government and hosted Coastal Virginians at our office’s Open House — so thankful to all who made the trip! https://t.co/mAuxsSOnSF I’m proud that House Democrats wasted no time presenting solutions to Coastal Virginians and all Americans. Senate Republicans should join us in support of tonight's measure so we can reopen government and turn our focus to the problems that Americans elected us to solve. So glad to connect with #VA02. Please click here to follow my Facebook page! https://t.co/03SmMoYhfu I don’t believe it’s fair or appropriate for Members of Congress to continue to receive paychecks while federal employees &amp; their families suffer. I’ve directed the Chief Administrative Officer of the House to withhold my pay until all our federal employees have been made whole. https://t.co/o0AQHnJWvM I’ll work tirelessly to honor our service members, veterans, and military families; protect Social Security and Medicare; safeguard our environment; speak truth to power; and make affordable health care more accessible. It is the honor of my lifetime to serve in Congress and represent Coastal Virginia, and I look forward to working on behalf of every person living in my district. Everything I do will be informed by what makes Virginia and America stronger. Big day of firsts at the U.S. Capitol: Picked up my House voting card, congressional pin, spouse’s pin, and cast initial votes for #VA02. Ready to go in the 116th Congress! https://t.co/WyKTMPySq8 I ran for Congress so our nation’s children would have a brighter future and follow their dreams. An unforgettable honor to be on the House Floor with my daughter Violette. Time to get to work for #VA02! https://t.co/4oNZTMJcox
