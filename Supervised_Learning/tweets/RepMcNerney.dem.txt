Once again, the president is trying to leverage a crisis that he created in an attempt to fulfill a campaign promise. This isn’t good policy and it isn’t good government.
https://t.co/kVPF9J9yg5 Mr. President, I look "even more forward" to watching you sign any of the 9 bills @HouseDemocrats have already passed to re-open the government. But if you want to continue your temper tantrum, that's certainly your prerogative. https://t.co/Lyrnh16SQh Due to a change in the House calendar, I will need to be in Washington, D.C next week for votes. Unfortunately, this means I have to cancel the open house events on the 23rd and 24th, but they will be rescheduled at a later date. .@senatemajldr won’t even consider re-opening the government – he’s too busy confirming a coal lobbyist to run the EPA. But, with the majority of EPA employees furloughed, @EPAAWheeler will be pretty lonely. @HouseDemocrats have some bills to fix that. https://t.co/NqFII0DUKN If you need to sign-up for health insurance, today is the last day of open enrollment in #CA. https://t.co/PtnoNPlfOr I'll be hosting an open house at my Stockton office on January 24th from 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM.

The House has done its job, and now it’s time for the Senate and the president to do theirs. https://t.co/FaJffhMh4Y The president's speech was vacuous, using fear &amp; lies to excite his base, but offering no new solutions. While he was fixated on the manufactured crisis at the border, the real crisis played out on our TVs: America is without a leader that is morally capable to lead. #TrumpSpeech Every day @realDonaldTrump keeps the government closed, America’s small businesses pay the price. From the businesses that serve federal workers to entrepreneurs seeking affordable capital, the #TrumpShutdown is hurting #SmallBiz. #EndTheShutdown ‘I’m proud to shut down this government’ says a man who thrives on chaos and cares not for the people impacted. Let’s bypass partisan warfare and find real solutions to real problems.  #TrumpShutDown Wishing everyone a safe and happy New Year! I’m looking forward to continuing to work on your behalf to strengthen our community and our country. Mary and I, along with the rest of my family, want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a safe holiday season. We live in a great country, and we have so much to be thankful for. I’m feeling very optimistic about this coming year. The inability of the Republican controlled Congress and White House to keep our government funded is a gross display of willful incompetence. The nation can look forward to having a Democratically controlled House to bring order to Washington in 2019. #TrumpShutdown Tonight, the federal government entered a partial shutdown because a handful of elected officials put their own ideologies before the best interests of all Americans. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/IfUYmreoP8 Yesterday, we saw the last and dangerous spasm of a dying and dysfunctional Republican Party under the leadership of an incompetent and corrupt president. #TrumpShutdown They’re willing to shut down the government to avoid challenging the president. But, we weren’t sent to Washington to work for the president. We were sent here to work for the American people. #TrumpShutdown In the 11th hour, after many compromises had been made in order to produce a robust and essential funding bill, the president pulled the rug out from under us, and House Republicans – a majority of whom supported the bill just hours before – fell in line. I voted against this legislation, not just because of the inclusion of the excessive border wall funding, but because this is not how our government should function. Instead, they offered their own version of the bill, which included $5 billion for the president’s wasteful border wall. Tonight, House Republicans gave in to pressure from the president and jeopardized our government’s stability. The Senate already passed a bipartisan funding measure, but House Republicans refused to bring that bill to the floor. The #FirstStepAct2018 allows judges more discretion in sentencing certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders, impacting thousands of people in federal prisons⚖️. #CriminalJusticeReform I had a great time at the Marine recruit holiday gathering this weekend.

But time is running out. We need 218 signatures on the CRA discharge petition to force a vote on the House Floor. 3 years after the #ParisAgreement, Republicans continue to stand by as the Trump administration repeals critical protections that impact the health of the American public. But I'll keep fighting against these reckless actions. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/P5UtJrXbuG Congressional districts are currently drawn by the very people who would benefit from partisan practices.

I look forward to seeing you there! https://t.co/yu2fXcoaqh As the entire world watched, @POTUS allowed an adversarial and dangerous foreign leader to question the integrity of our most trusted institutions. This is truly a sad day in American history. https://t.co/Kyt3rDhzML I recently had the privilege of speaking at the Discovery ChallenNGe Academy Graduation in Stockton. Please join me in congratulating this year's graduates - a group of dedicated young men &amp; women who are committed to their education &amp; to continuing to give back to our community. https://t.co/DhbtGFpnWS It was wonderful to meet with this year's rising stars &amp; their families at the Service Academies Reception. It’s always a pleasure to have the opportunity 
 to talk with these students. Their commitment to service-learning and to our country is truly inspiring. https://t.co/2IDS6cfDYj These indictments make it clear that we must continue to support Director #Mueller’s investigation. Russia made a concerted effort to erode public trust in our democratic process &amp; we must utilize all resources to ensure this does't happen in the future. https://t.co/RCRl69OyVe RT @EnergyCommerce: HAPPENING NOW: Committee is debating a resolution that would require the Trump Administration to provide critical docum… Thanks to James and Carol from Stockton, who took a few minutes from their day to stop by my office. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet with constituents visiting DC! https://t.co/Szy935mo0o Great discussion on the innovative technologies moving healthcare forward. Thanks for the opportunity to be apart of this important conversation! https://t.co/phcc8VdNzE Great Meeting with @BrianOftedal of the @ECCFPD. Our firefighters sacrifice every day to protect our community, and we must continue to support their important work. That’s why I’m committed to continuing to look for new ways to help our Fire  District at the federal level. https://t.co/O5aPXI6tHe Wishing you and your family a safe and happy #IndependenceDay! https://t.co/3Z6HyRuSfi Today I had the privilege of participating in a naturalization ceremony, &amp; welcoming our nation’s newest citizens. All have put in tremendous work to reach this goal &amp; now they will be a part of an even greater task: helping to write America’s next chapter. Congratulations! https://t.co/ajsu7dm0yg Clean energy is cost effective &amp; will provide a better quality of life for students &amp; everyone in our community. I was pleased to join the Lodi Unified School District Board of Education members &amp; staff for a demonstration of their new electric school bus. https://t.co/F8tm7dGNwM Americans deserve to feel safe in their workplaces, classrooms, churches and other spaces where these heinous and avoidable acts of violence have occurred.

The Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. #EqualityForward Access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. That's why I signed the discharge petition and will continue to fight to reverse the @FCC's disastrous repeal of #NetNeutrality protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/xXiiOIKnhO Women have a right to accurate and unbiased information about their healthcare options. Today’s SCOTUS decision in #NIFLAvBecerra opens the door for misleading and inaccurate information to be given freely to women in need of health services. #EndTheLies The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel ban is a direct contrast to the founding principles of our nation. This ruling is an endorsement of discriminatory policies of the past, and does not represent our values. #NoMuslimBanEver Kicking off the second meeting of the Bipartisan #CampaignFinance Reform Caucus with @usapromise, @takebackorg and Fix it America. https://t.co/6eFBu70xjl Mary and I had a great time at the Town of Discovery Bay’s 20th Anniversary Celebration this weekend.

As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I’ll fight back against this heartbreaking policy until this abhorrent practice ends. https://t.co/tVUK4dB9Kj I've heard from thousands of Californians about this issue, &amp; I'll continue to fight in Congress to repeal this backward policy shift. To follow the hearing on #SB822, tune in here: https://t.co/KzBjClrPde 2/2 Strong #netneutrality protections are crucial to the free flow of ideas &amp; future economic growth. As the #California Assembly considers #SB822, I hope they’ll uphold the critical protections laid out in this legislation. 1/2 #Juneteenth is more than a celebration of progress, it is a reminder of the continued work we must do to eradicate systemic racial injustices throughout our nation. We must continue to fight for equality and use our past as a guide for a better future for all Americans. https://t.co/9WviFfOq1c There is no greater moral obligation that we have than to care for the children of this world. Tearing them from the arms of their parents is just despicable. I'll continue fighting to #keepfamiliestogether and put an end to this cruel and inhumane policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/z4qhGqCl8r @WhipHoyer @EnergyCommerce Thank you, my friend! This week I had the opportunity to talk to some bright young students from Bristow Middle School in Brentwood.
