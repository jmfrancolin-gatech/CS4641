John Dingell will be remembered for his esteemed service, landmark legislation, &amp; incomparable wit. His leadership at a time when Congress was less partisan &amp; more responsive to the people will not be forgotten.
 
Our thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and John’s family &amp; friends. Looking forward to working as ranking member of @SenateAgDems subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry &amp; Natural Resources &amp; @SenateFinance subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources &amp; Infrastructure to fight for CO’s rural communities &amp; advance bipartisan clean energy solutions. Thank you @RepDianaDeGette for leading the first House oversight hearing on the Trump administration’s inhumane and cruel family separation policy. The White House must be held accountable. https://t.co/Vh9n2ZmLYv More evidence that @realDonaldTrump should prioritize #climatechange, not ignore it like he did in the #SOTU. Today @NASA and @NOAA found that 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record. https://t.co/tT540EuKfk Every Coloradan, whether they live in a city or the mountains, should have access to affordable, high-quality health care. That's why my #MedicareX plan would roll out first in rural communities. Today I met with @coruralhealth to hear their input on expanding access. https://t.co/9KJXNEa74W The state I represent is a third republican, a third democratic, and a third independent. Colorado knows what hard, bipartisan work really looks like. We’ll be looking in the days, months, and years ahead to see if any of it can be produced in Washington. We heard nothing in tonight’s speech that addressed how the President will help raise incomes for middle-class Americans, make quality higher education more affordable, or address the urgent problem of climate change. It will take more than a speech to paper over President Trump’s consistent view that the only obligation he has is to his political base. What lines did we miss? He thinks Democrats have “turned into an angry mob, bent on destroying anything or anyone in their path.” He has said Democrats are “too dangerous to govern” and have “gone wacko.” He has called Democrats “totally unhinged” and the “party of crime.” It will be interesting to hear what @realDonaldTrump comes up with tonight to talk about his commitment to bipartisanship. He should probably not repeat these earlier lines: The real state of our union includes families concerned about #climatechange, #healthcare, #education &amp; more. Here's a roundup of what @POTUS should address tonight:

⚡️ “What Coloradans Want to Hear in the State of the Union”

https://t.co/SKPDr1UXr9 JoBeth J. says, "I want to hear a clear and precise plan to reunite children separated from their parents at the border." Angela H. wants to know how the Trump administration will #ActOnClimate, asking “What initiatives will we take to reduce greenhouse emissions and commit to renewable, clean energy?” Carrie H. says “My family is made up of a small business owner, firefighter &amp; college student. We work hard &amp; want our tax $ spent to improve our CO communities, schools &amp; environment. I’m tired of hearing lies &amp; stupid rhymes to spend my money on a useless wall.” Emy K. raised issues we don’t talk about enough: #broadband &amp; #mentalhealth.
“I'd like to see work on rural broadband access… Funding for mental health, leaving our #PublicLands public &amp; no more government shutdowns are important to me.” We asked, and you answered. Here’s a roundup of some of the responses we received on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram &amp; via email. This is what Coloradans believe are the top priorities for tonight’s #SOTU. https://t.co/8S34lvA8Jy Leading a bipartisan group with @SenBillCassidy to draft legislation that eliminates surprise medical bills. In our latest effort, we’re seeking answers from the providers and insurers on their billing practices. https://t.co/hTbmxoNnMC Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating today! Hoping the #YearOfThePig brings you happiness, good health, and prosperity. Grateful to have @OspreyPacks, a leading outdoor manufacturer based in Cortez, support the #COREAct. 

“Many of our customers &amp; own team members regularly visit these outdoor treasures…This supports a thriving modern-day recreation &amp; tourist economy.” 

https://t.co/zxaR5rRsPT Rolling back fuel economy standards is bad policy. Instead we should reduce pollution &amp; make our auto industry more competitive.

Ahead of today's @EPAAWheeler vote, @GovofCO &amp; I called on him to finalize a rule that makes cars more efficient &amp; affordable.
https://t.co/RcQfKzOr8I Tonight, @POTUS will deliver the #SOTU, and we need to make sure he addresses the real priorities of Coloradans. That’s why I want to hear from you. 

Share the issues that are important to you with hashtag #VoicesOfCO &amp; I'll RT them throughout the day. https://t.co/qOKhu8TYR3 “You must never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right.”- Rosa Parks

It was written night after night in rooms &amp; county commission buildings across Colorado, as neighbors sat together to iron out their differences &amp; do something special for the next generation of Coloradans. https://t.co/IPvm1jH4f9 The photo is racist and despicable. Governor Northam should step down and allow his Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax, to become the next Governor of Virginia. Amazing way to close out the @OutdoorRetailer show with an @OIA endorsement for our #COREAct. The name of the bill—Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy Act—says it all. We don’t have to choose between protecting public lands &amp; boosting our economy. One leads to the next. https://t.co/fbqu7tpLtH Honored to use your photos &amp; grateful for your support of the #COREAct. It’s time to protect these treasured lands. https://t.co/DLNZXuGyv2 RT @ConservationCO: Speaking in front of a great view with @SenatorBennet and @JoeNeguse: “They are truly leaders who lead with the legacy… These outdoor enthusiasts told me why they support protecting public lands.

My #AmericanFamilyAct would bring much-needed stability to their lives by helping them cover these essentials and continue to work. https://t.co/8MDNvwggHc For decades, we’ve seen economic growth almost entirely benefit the top 10% of Americans. My #AmericanFamilyAct would address this inequality, providing critical support to low-income &amp; middle-class parents who have been left out—ultimately cutting child poverty nearly in half. Everywhere I go, I meet people who are working hard &amp; can’t afford some combination of housing, health care, higher education &amp; child care.

These aren’t nice-to-haves—they are must haves.

My #AmericanFamilyAct w/ @SenSherrodBrown would help change that. https://t.co/z6w09w1Zg8 There are no words to describe the despicable attack on Jussie Smollett. We must all come together to stand up against homophobia, racism, and all forms of hate. My thoughts are with Jussie, and I wish him a speedy recovery. https://t.co/g0xeq612WA Ten years ago, the signing of the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act was a significant milestone in the fight against gender discrimination, but more needs to be done. Congress should pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct to help ensure #EqualPay for equal work. Because the #COREAct is community-driven, it creates new wilderness areas and also preserves outdoor recreation opportunities, so Coloradans can continue to explore the outdoors.

Ted Cruz over shutdown: "When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013,… While @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr are playing politics with their reckless shutdown, federal workers like Brian from Greeley are hurting. 

@SenateGOP needs to hear the alarm from American workers and act to #EndTheShutdown. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/c5TOzqlrLS If you work hard, run a business, and provide for your family, your last concern should be your own government getting in the way. When national parks close in our state, business drops for shop owners like Amy. We must reopen the government. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/VCIO0WqU8D Today is Day 33 of the #TrumpShutdown.

https://t.co/joiei8LbhE We have so much work to do—to raise incomes, send our kids to great schools, and keep our communities safe.

Anything less is unacceptable. https://t.co/yohMufXT5Y .@senatemajldr can end this #TrumpShutdown today. 

Instead, he’s putting legislation on the floor to attack women’s health care. As the shutdown drags on, Colorado breweries like @upslope—which I visited last year—face uncertainty over new beer launches &amp; stand to lose thousands in revenue. It’s far past time to reopen the government. Today I called on @USTreasury to take action: https://t.co/aWssQNG7Fi https://t.co/H7zgFPU914 Our outdoor economy and the Coloradans that support it are suffering because of the #TrumpShutdown.

https://t.co/hjIWnzXCuT The idea that, in the 21st century, some people are trying to restrict everyone from being counted in the #2020Census is a profound embarrassment to our country. SCOTUS should uphold this decision.  https://t.co/KdENgWymPX Over the weekend, our government set a new record.
Not for the number of roads repaired or bridges built.
Not for higher graduation rates for our kids.
Not for passing the most bills or investing in our future.
But for the longest shutdown in U.S. history. 
This is a travesty. This is the exact opposite of what we heard at @NationalWestern Stock Show. Colorado farmers can’t get @USDA loans &amp; are concerned about getting projects up &amp; running. @realDonaldTrump can try to spin this all he wants, but our state feels the real burden. https://t.co/HD8gj4E3TW While the United States is shut down, China has landed a space craft on the dark side of the moon, and is doing all kinds of things to fill the vacuum that we have left.

As the #TrumpShutdown continues, and @senatemajldr refuses to bring the House-passed bills to reopen the government to a vote, Coloradans pay the price.

There is no legitimate reason to rush this public review. #ArcticRefuge https://t.co/hebGcLUBIm It’s Day 20. @POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr are blocking our efforts to reopen the government. And they’re getting paid. Meanwhile, federal employees across the country won't receive paychecks tomorrow. That’s outrageous. As I’ve done before, I will donate my paycheck. Mr. President, stop playing politics with the livelihoods of 15,700 Coloradans. We must reopen the government. https://t.co/i1DvIjuzHA The #TrumpSpeech tonight showed @realDonaldTrump is willing to go to any length to get his ineffective wall, even at the expense of American workers and families. This shutdown is ridiculous. We must reopen the government. Why has @realDonaldTrump #shutdown the government? Over a wall he promised Mexico would pay for. Clearly he didn’t fulfill that promise or we wouldn’t be here. He's also lying about the need for this wall, b/c we've offered him $25 billion for border security &amp; he turned it down. https://t.co/GtSRtEeTf6 The shutdown has now lasted 18 days—the second longest in history—and every day it gets worse. @senatemajldr should bring up the Republican-supported bills that have already passed the House and reopen the government immediately. https://t.co/GpK4JRaKUR The #TrumpShutdown is what happens when you have a President who is willfully indifferent to the struggles of Americans who work for a living. We need to end it immediately.
https://t.co/Ehq34W59Eq If @realDonaldTrump got up from the Resolute Desk and walked down the hall, his Chief of Staff could explain to him that his views on a wall are “simplistic,” “absurd” and “almost childish.”

“Don’t use us as leverage to get what you want politically.”  

Coloradans need us to reopen the government. This must be our top priority. https://t.co/EQ7JvzGTDn Letting politicians choose their voters is antithetical to our democracy.

Furloughed workers can’t wait months or years. Farmers &amp; ranchers can’t wait months or years. Small business owners can’t wait months or years.

Coloradans are stepping up to fill the void left by @realDonaldTrump’s shutdown. It’s time to reopen the government. 
https://t.co/6rhng8RAgl Today, we welcome a Congress that looks more like America than any in our history. The agenda is long and the expectations are high. First priority: Reopening the government. Let’s get to work. #116thCongress Today marks up to $24 MILLION in lost revenue due to closed national parks in Colorado. @realDonaldTrump's shutdown is causing our state’s outdoor economy to lose $1.9 million per day and withholding pay from more than 7,000 Coloradans. This is unacceptable. RT @ColoradoSun: In an opinion piece, @SenBennetCO writes: Growing hemp means growing economic opportunity in rural Colorado https://t.co/p… Children should never be held in conditions like these. We must change the incentives for those parents who take such enormous risks to escape extraordinary danger in their home countries. We also need an immigration system that reflects our values. https://t.co/vXb6vUkU8r The government is shut down over a “border wall.” Another migrant child died in custody on Christmas. And millions of Dreamers, farmers, &amp; business owners are uncertain of their futures. We need a new path forward to reform our immigration system.
 
https://t.co/HLt4sOtZf6 Keeping the government open should not depend on the President’s demand for U.S. taxpayers to fund an ineffective and wasteful border wall. 
 
The onus falls on @POTUS to keep the government running, but it’s the American people that will pay the price. The President is willing and “proud” to shut down the government over an ineffective border wall, and the American people pay the price. We want a secure border. We don’t want @realDonaldTrump’s invented political issue. Full interview with @KatyTurNBC: https://t.co/PbXsvkCT7h We don’t need the nuclear option to secure the border. We need leadership that uses facts to forge consensus. That $46.3 billion was for agents, technology, &amp; 350 miles of fence—what experts agreed was the intelligent way to secure our border. It was double what @realdonaldtrump wants for his ineffective wall. Plus we modernized our visa system &amp; created a path to citizenship for 11M ppl In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill, with 68 votes, that provided $46.3 billion in border security. People seeking to immigrate legally—not American taxpayers—would have paid for this through new application fees. https://t.co/LPalIKGRdT His resignation letter is a poignant testament to enduring American values and alliances. We must preserve both. Throughout his distinguished career, Secretary Mattis served our country honorably. Senators from both sides of the aisle, including myself, took some solace in his presence in the Trump administration. Today @POTUS signed the five-year #FarmBill we wrote in the Ag Committee to bring certainty to farmers &amp; ranchers. We said we’d get this bill done by the end of the year, and thanks to the hard work of Coloradans, we did. https://t.co/yzVxbT2t7r We cannot forget that thousands of migrant children remain in U.S. custody. They fled violence and corruption in their home communities seeking a better life. The administration must move them quickly out of custody and into safe and healthy homes. 

https://t.co/zn5eLo3zsP Instead of making life harder for families in poverty, how about a work requirement for this president? https://t.co/ygBmzUM1WU Coloradans deserve a Congress responsive to their priorities, but Washington has failed to pass significant public lands legislation for years. We must pass a package that includes #LWCF &amp; new wilderness/recreation designations in Colorado, including the San Juan Wilderness bill. We continue to set a terrible example for how we govern ourselves in a democracy. Our disagreements should not be excuses for gridlock, but invitations to solve problems. That’s the standard set by generations who came before us. We should learn from their example. A choice between shutting down our government over a border wall or passing another short-term budget is typical Washington. https://t.co/6hWBGw7iLv Every child deserves a healthy start in life, and this law will increase those odds for babies at risk of premature birth.

After trying &amp; failing over 70 times to repeal the bill w/o offering a replacement, GOP added a provision to their disastrous tax bill to sabotage the individual mandate, providing the argument used in the TX court's ruling.

Tune in on Facebook → https://t.co/pZ1BNnLOFe The farmers and ranchers of Colorado wrote enormous parts of this #FarmBill, and what passed today is a reflection of their priorities. We have done our work—from the Agriculture Committee to the Senate floor—to advance this truly bipartisan #FarmBill. After two years of work, we’re just steps away from making good on our promise to Colorado’s farmers and ranchers to pass a bill by the end of the year. The President should not be “proud” to shut down the government for any reason, especially around the holidays. Tantrums like that highlight why Coloradans are so frustrated with Washington. I hope he will stop this brinkmanship &amp; work with Congress to keep the government open. This bipartisan #FarmBill will legalize hemp, conserve land and water, combat climate change &amp; bolster economic security in rural communities. The finish line is in sight. Now Congress needs to do what’s right for Colorado &amp; send this bill to @POTUS' desk by the end of the year. https://t.co/3fzUs1nEwb For those of us fortunate enough to be serving now, history will judge our response. No one is above the law.  It’s time to put country and Constitution above all else. https://t.co/D58ZR3ixBY "On the merits, the Bennet-Brown proposal is a tremendously good bill.

My #FairMapsAct would explicitly prohibit partisan gerrymandering &amp; help citizens regain control of their government. https://t.co/37BeaeQQYa Coloradans know firsthand the danger #climatechange poses to our economy, our health, and our communities.

This year, Colorado had the honor of displaying a piece of that history. #PearlHarbor77

https://t.co/vChvA6QQTZ Where are @realDonaldTrump’s tweets about the election fraud in #NorthCarolina? I seem to have missed them... If you abuse power when you win, and you abuse power when you lose, you probably don’t deserve power in the first place. #Michigan #Wisconsin
https://t.co/o0mGQSyXZw On the phone w/@SecElaineChao today learning Colorado will receive $47 million to improve state infrastructure. Thanks to the work of our communities, grants will help reconstruct North I-25 corridor, increase connectivity to prep for new technology &amp; improve roads &amp; broadband. https://t.co/Bt6yMrMFLK This may be why.
 
https://t.co/P5MK0Yv1Rh Over a year ago, I wrote the Trump administration asking them to prevent foreign conflicts of interest. They never responded. 

Letter: https://t.co/B7nFZSpW6q https://t.co/NKnltLZdo2 Markets know @realDonaldTrump's trade deal is not real. The President has done nothing to address issues with China that disadvantage American workers, businesses &amp; families. We need a strategy, not tweets. https://t.co/dCq5Spl7PC The CIA should immediately provide a briefing to the full Senate on the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Given the President’s insufficient response, it is critical that we know the facts underpinning the intelligence community’s assessment. Encouraged to see @xcelenergy become the first major utility company in the country to commit to being emission-free by 2050. They’re taking a bold step to combat #climatechange that others should follow. https://t.co/8GJoMfKzQF George H.W. Bush was a true public servant: thoughtful, patriotic, and committed to our nation’s leadership in the world. He led with dignity, cherishing country and family above all else. He will be greatly missed. On eve of President-elect López Obrador’s inauguration, sent letter calling on @VP to use his visit to Mexico to reframe bilateral relations in a manner that upholds our two nations’ shared democratic values &amp; common commitment to prosperity and security. https://t.co/n25FxZyblk The family featured in this @CBSDenver story tells us exactly why we need to pass #eviction legislation. The human and societal costs of the eviction crisis are only growing worse. https://t.co/qRU3dbjak4 In the federal census, every person in this country counts. We should be working to build trust in government, not using scare tactics to prevent people from participating. https://t.co/yfi9Xx8GWm ICYMI: Talked to @NewsCPR about my plan to tackle the #eviction crisis. We need more data so cities like Denver can reduce the number of evictions. This is a tremendous problem for tenants &amp; creates a huge economic disruption for our country. https://t.co/vliMvgnz9e This is a massive breach of data and trust. Congress should learn the lessons of Yahoo, Equifax, Marriott, and Facebook, and rethink how companies collect and use our personal data. https://t.co/iKbBrdLvEE This is a headline no one should have had to write. https://t.co/g8cFNkc24u It's hard to imagine that our parents &amp; grandparents would have allowed 70,000 Americans to die every year from drug overdoses without doing something about it. It is well past time we fully confronted the #opioidcrisis ripping through Colorado &amp; country. https://t.co/UonBKURt9X NEWS: Today we unveiled a plan to tackle the #eviction crisis. The costs of eviction are enormous for both tenants &amp; taxpayers. My plan: 
1. Improves access to eviction data 
2. Curbs preventable evictions
3. Limit damage when evictions occur https://t.co/4sQo0pPVWZ I’ve been part of bipartisan forest policy discussions for years—it’s how we passed recent forest management reforms &amp; a #FireFix for the @forestservice budget. I stand ready to work with the admin if it's serious about implementing these new forestry tools to prevent #wildfires. Colorado farmers &amp; ranchers need Congress to pass a #FarmBill by the end of the year. It’s the least we can do as they face drought &amp; a trade war. The admin’s attempt to use the tragic wildfires in California to push partisan forest policy &amp; block the bill is unacceptable. If you’ve been following the debt &amp; deficit debate, here’s more on the bill I introduced to eliminate the debt limit: https://t.co/QgwL7TFyT3 It’s a shame we haven't reached an agreement in Joint Select Cmt on #Budget &amp; Approps to eliminate the debt limit. It hasn’t done a thing to cut the debt. All it’s done is tarnish our nation’s good name, downgrade our credit rating &amp; deal a blow to savings of American families. Today @POTUS doubled down, saying he does not believe the #NCA4 conclusions on the economic costs of climate change. Instead of politicizing science, we need a serious, bipartisan proposal to combat #ClimateChange.  https://t.co/Pg8f5Iw7O9 RT @ColoradoSun: In an opinion piece, @SenBennetCO writes:

What facts do you have to refute them? Stop politicizing science. https://t.co/OyE9OEghVW Thrilling day for our nation’s space program. Congratulations to the @LockheedMartin team in Jeffco that designed and built @NASAInSight to make the first #MarsLanding in 6 years. https://t.co/blik8iczM2 I’m glad to see the Trump administration is finally acknowledging the science behind our changing climate—now it’s time they act on it. #NCA4 https://t.co/BTUzqIJjQW The Trump Administration just released a report putting facts behind what Colorado farmers &amp; ranchers have told me for years: #ClimateChange is harming agriculture &amp; the livelihood of rural communities. Good to see the Admin start listening to science. Now let's act on it. #NCA4 https://t.co/Imka2082f0 On #Thanksgiving, many Americans give thanks for the blessing of a safe &amp; stable home, but too many families in Colorado and across the country don’t share that good fortune. More on my plan to prevent the pain and human costs of the eviction crisis: https://t.co/ESclXz6mCs #HappyThanksgiving from Susan, our girls, and me. We are grateful today and everyday to be living in a state that is so future-oriented and collaborative. It’s an honor to represent such a special place. Chairman Grassley: As Justice Alito responded that night, this is not true → https://t.co/tjv0DBT5M7 https://t.co/gg3oekUxVC Courts should be working to protect &amp; uphold the rights of all Americans, not some. That’s why I’ve introduced the #FairMaps Act to prohibit partisan gerrymandering &amp; help citizens regain control of their government at a time when our political system is more broken than ever. A North Carolina law that disenfranchised African Americans was struck down in 2016. Now @POTUS has nominated the architect of that law, Thomas Farr, to the federal judiciary. We should not appoint someone who makes it harder, instead of easier, for people to vote. As the world’s oldest democracy, we must reclaim our leadership in protecting press freedom. @POTUS’ dog-whistle, distraction approach is not just dangerous &amp; irresponsible. In this case, it helps validate a murder &amp; could lead to more violence against members of the media. Pleased to see Colorado join 13 states and charge ahead with low emission vehicle standards. It’s well beyond time for the Trump administration to get on board and do what is right for American families and car manufactures. https://t.co/d7jiLz3Eku Grateful for the opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to fix our immigration system. There's still so much more work to be done &amp; we need more partners like @SenatorLankford who are willing to step across the aisle to find solutions, showing we are nation of both laws &amp; grace. https://t.co/2GB4EYlamI RT @Backcountry_H_A: This is an important bill that we fully support. Thank you @SenBennetCO for introducing this bipartisan bill to addres… At @ColoradoStateU, 1500 students are facing GI Bill benefit issues due to a VA IT problem. Student veterans across the country have not received housing payments for weeks. I’ve called on @SecWilkie to take action until every veteran receives benefits. https://t.co/VcIQGlNcIp RT @NatImmForum: .@SenBennetCO: "If we continue to build bridges between people of different political parties and walks of life, ultimatel… RT @anoorani: Kicking off at 830a is #LeadingTheWay18 — panels with ⁦@SenatorLankford⁩ ⁦@SenBennetCO⁩ ⁦@drmoore⁩ ⁦@cccuorg⁩ ⁦@djheakin⁩ ⁦@m… We’re at the @NatImmForum this morning talking about our bipartisan work to fix our broken immigration immigration system and uphold American values. Watch my conversation with @SenatorLankford live: https://t.co/G5HrcAPQWP #LeadingtheWay18 https://t.co/FScqaAjNGj The @SenMajLdr just shot down a bipartisan bill to protect the #MuellerInvestigation—an investigation that has already found 8 people guilty &amp; put 4 behind bars. This is not a time for politics. We must stand up for the rule of law. At this year's VA Medical Center opening in Aurora, I was reminded of the tireless work of the veterans involved in making the facility a reality. When faced with setbacks, they doubled-down. These Rocky Mountain veterans set an example for the rest of us to follow. #VeteransDay https://t.co/gOEB8sTLF4 Thank you to our nation's veterans. B/c of your service, we have the greatest capacity for self-defense of any country in history. There should be no obstacle so insurmountable in providing you the best care &amp; support in return. Today we rededicate ourselves to meet that promise. It’s up to all of us to fulfill our civic responsibility and stand up for the rule of law. Thank you to the thousands of Americans who are standing up tonight at rallies across the country. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/5C0v8vZ3nv In the Mueller investigation, 35 defendants have faced charges. 8 individuals have been found guilty &amp; 4 are behind bars. This is not a “witch hunt” or “fake news.” #ProtectMueller This is not a country where the President is above the law. That’s what separates us from other countries, and that’s worth fighting for. We must protect the Mueller investigation. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/guPYfOBP2t We're live from the Capitol steps in Denver tonight because nobody is above the law. Tune in: https://t.co/hnx3hB85yk Our kids should be able to go to a bar without the fear of being shot down. My heart breaks for parents &amp; loved ones of those killed in LA. Americans sent a message Tues by electing officials who support background checks &amp; other measures to end gun violence. We must take action.
