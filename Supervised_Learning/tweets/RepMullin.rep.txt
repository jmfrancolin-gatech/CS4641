The president’s #SOTU address delivered a message of unity to the American people. He made a plea that GOPs &amp; Dems choose greatness. But the way in which we allow individual Americans to pursue their own greatness is what sets our government above the rest. #WeeklyWrapUp https://t.co/1FCeHbB8Gp Proud to join my colleagues @RepJoeWilson and @RepJohnYarmuth to cosponsor the #MilitarySurvivingSpouses Equity Act working to end the unfair ‘Widow’s tax.’ https://t.co/coPNH6LPJq @DoreyScheimer @grayjustin I think that can be arranged.

My full statement on #SOTU https://t.co/6dLsjfq2uJ Our country is unique because at the end of the day, what unites us will always be greater than what divides us. I look forward to working with Congress to accomplish the president’s agenda and hope that my colleagues across the aisle stand ready to do the same. .@POTUS offered our nation a path forward, a chance to work together to accomplish great things for the American people. There isn’t a single thing in this plan that people should think is divisive. .@POTUS: "We must keep #AmericaFirst in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: "Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history." .@POTUS: "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU .@POTUS: "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives." #BuildtheWall #SOTU "The State of our Union is STRONG." #SOTU "Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades...Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps...Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century." Our economy continues to soar thanks to @POTUS. #SOTU .@POTUS: "Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country."

I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle in the coming weeks to put lawful American citizens before politics. Today, @POTUS laid out an agreement to reopen the government and end the #shutdown. The resilience and support of the federal workers over the past month has been incredible. I want to thank them and their families for their commitment to our country. As a father of 5, my kids are the greatest gifts I could have ever received. After Roe v.
