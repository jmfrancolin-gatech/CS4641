As I have said all along, the obvious, necessary resolution is a compromise that improves border security – including physical barriers where they make sense – and delivers on some Democrat priorities, too. I am glad the government is reopening and 800,000 federal employees are getting paid. Over the next three weeks, the president and Congress will have an opportunity to craft a workable solution. I hope today’s votes will bring Speaker Pelosi and Democrats to the table so there is an agreement that reopens the government, secures the border, and allows federal employees to return to work with pay. Speaker Pelosi has, thus far, refused to negotiate and my Democratic colleagues, just today, went so far as to block efforts to pay Coast Guard members and other federal employees who have been working without pay. In a compromise, neither side gets everything they want and both sides get something they want. There is a deal to be had here that improves border security - including physical barriers where they make sense - and delivers on some Democrat priorities, too. As I have said all along, the obvious, necessary resolution is a compromise. I am willing to compromise. In a compromise, neither side gets everything they want and both sides get something they want. I am willing to compromise. I hope today’s votes represent modest progress toward ending this partial government shutdown. These votes demonstrate that neither the president’s proposal nor the Democrat proposal have enough support to pass Congress.

Speaker Pelosi should allow the House to do the same. The president’s offer, which is based on the bipartisan BRIDGE Act introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin – who serves as the number two Democrat in the Senate – would provide legal status to DACA recipients for three years. Now, President Trump is offering Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats a top legislative priority of theirs in an effort to end this partial government shutdown. President Trump's request for $5.7 billion in border security funding is reasonable and certainly deserved a counter proposal, at the very least. But Speaker Pelosi has refused to​ negotiate. Having served with @SenAngusKing for several years now, I have no doubt he’ll overcome this newest challenge. I wish him a full and speedy recovery. https://t.co/t7B21fTmDC It was a pleasure to meet with President Walton of @CheyneyUniv today.

The victims &amp; wounded from the tragedy in CA &amp; the 1st responders are in my prayers. Throughout his career, Attorney General Sessions has tirelessly worked to uphold the rule of law and keep our communities safe.

I greatly appreciate the actions of the first responders who tended to the wounded and apprehended the shooter.

On behalf of the remaining 37 PA firms harmed by these taxes, I urge the Dept. to redouble its efforts: https://t.co/Wf6PCGELRc Taxes on imported steel are hurting construction of the Shell cracker plant in SW PA. This project supports thousands of high-paying jobs and econ growth in the region. @SecretaryRoss must exempt US firms from these harmful taxes and quotas. https://t.co/TiooJuunSu Senator McCain led a life that should be admired and respected by all Americans. I am proud to have called him a friend. Kris and I send our deepest sympathies to Cindy and the entire McCain family. And for more than thirty years, Senator McCain fought for Arizonans in the Senate. Most importantly, Senator McCain was not afraid to fight for what he thought was right, even when it was unpopular. But most of all Senator McCain was a fighter. He fought for his country in Vietnam. He fought for his brothers in arms while being held as prisoners of war. Today is a sad day for the Senate and America. Senator John McCain was a hero and one of our nation’s greatest patriots. POTUS’s taxes on imported steel are hurting econ growth &amp; job creation. That is why I sent another letter to the Admin listing 37 PA firms harmed by these unnecessary taxes. I will continue working w/ my colleagues to restore Congress's trade powers. https://t.co/UzbOoI14Fs My prayers are with John, and the entire McCain family right now. I wish them all peace and comfort in this most difficult time. I was humbled to attend the Medal of Honor ceremony for Tech. Sgt. John Chapman, who gave his life in 2002 serving our country. We must never forget the sacrifice armed services members make to defend the freedoms &amp; liberties we hold most dear. https://t.co/Xj9rxzKd7f In case you missed it, @DCExaminer profiles my work to expand prosperity for all Pennsylvanians and my role in the biggest legislative issues of this Congress. https://t.co/zAiFkYpuC9 A huge congratulations to Johnstown's own Martella's Pharmacy baseball team who are the 2018 @aaababaseball Champions! With a 3-2 win over the New Orleans Boosters, Johnstown won it’s first championship in the tournament's 74 year history! https://t.co/M47nD0K01j Had a great time traveling through the western part of the state this week. During stops in Warren, Forest, Venango, and Mercer Counties, I had the chance to talk to a lot of great community leaders about issues facing their citizens. https://t.co/GvAiM5b2p5 While in Berks Co. yesterday, I stopped by to speak to the folks at @ReadingEagle. I enjoyed our wide-ranging conversation, which touched on everything from Judge Kavanaugh to common-sense gun reform. Read more about our conversation- https://t.co/7lr4tZqXNz Pennsylvania lost a great man with the passing of Gerry Lenfest. Through his work and generosity, Gerry left an indelible mark on Philadelphia and our entire commonwealth. His contributions are rightly, universally admired. My condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues. Join me for another telephone town hall beginning ~4:30. Questions or comments can be left below, or at this link—where you can also listen in: https://t.co/W6zAZr6jrV Barring votes, I’ll be hosting a town hall at ~4:30 today. Be on the lookout for details about how to participate. Feel free to leave questions in the comments below. I'll be hosting another telephone town hall tomorrow at ~4:30 PM. These town halls are a great opportunity to hear what issues matter to you, and share the latest on what I'm working on down in D.C. Details to come. I look forward to following Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing and I intend to support his nomination when it comes to the Senate floor. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give Judge Kavanaugh fair consideration so that Republicans &amp; Democrats can work together to confirm this highly qualified jurist. Judge Kavanaugh understands that the proper role of a judge is to apply neutrally the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written, &amp; not to decide cases based on personal or partisan policy  preferences. I was very pleased to meet with Judge Kavanaugh this morning. Based on my review of his record and our conversation, it is clear to me that Judge Kavanaugh has the character, intellect, experience, &amp; judicial philosophy to be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. https://t.co/GqUXhc4fs8 Eliminating tariffs and breaking down trade barriers between the US and the EU would enhance our bilateral trading relationship and make both our peoples more prosperous. I support @POTUS and President Juncker's efforts to make this a reality. ICYMI: I joined @mitchellreports on @MSNBC today to discuss the bailout for farmers who’ve been hurt by the administration’s misguided trade policies. Watch: https://t.co/kZtdVHr9UY The U.S. Department of Agriculture is trying to put a band-aid on a self-inflicted wound. The administration clobbers farmers with an unnecessary trade war then attempts to assuage them with taxpayer handouts. This bailout compounds bad policy with more bad policy. Putin’s attempts to undermine our elections should be continuously met with swift &amp; strong repercussions by Congress/White House. Read letter from @ChrisVanHollen &amp; me urging @USTreasury to take action against the 12 Russians indicted by @TheJusticeDept: https://t.co/aLP5XPN6p5 Vladimir Putin &amp; those acting at his direction meddled in our 2016 presidential election. Accordingly, @USTreasury should again exercise the tools it has at its disposal &amp; penalize those identified as carrying out this attack on our country. Happy #NationalPennsylvaniaDay!

My staff and I have been in contact with the @USArmy and are awaiting more information. My thoughts are with those who are injured, their families, and the entire Letterkenny community. https://t.co/HVtVPnMa5x Link to join my teletown hall here: https://t.co/CP7H9mHWOd I've been hearing from a lot of constituents this week on everything that's going on in Washington. Setting up a teletown hall this AM to speak with you about news from D.C.. We'll go live ~10:50, link to come soon. Will also take Qs from Twitter and Facebook. .@POTUS' blindness to Putin’s hostile acts against the US and our allies—election meddling included—is very troubling. Please read my statement in reaction to today’s Helsinki press conference: https://t.co/7JGtcfg9ph Absent his cooperation in achieving that justice, the United States should impose tough new sanctions on Russia. Putin insists that the Russian government has nothing to do with meddling in our elections. In that case, he should not object to the hackers recently indicted being brought to justice. it’s clear that Putin is a bad actor and should be treated as an international pariah. Whether it's protecting the hackers responsible for this crime, committing numerous human rights violations, invading Ukraine, annexing Crimea, supporting the Iranian regime, taking hostile actions in Syria, or threatening peaceful European neighbors, American intelligence agencies have confirmed, unequivocally, that Russian actors, almost certainly at the direction of the Russian government and Vladimir Putin, meddled in our 2016 presidential election. During the #NetNeutrality debate, bad actors abused @FCC's comment filing system, submitting fake opinions from ppl like @SenJeffMerkley + me. Thank you @AjitPaiFCC for giving this issue your full attention &amp; pledging to improve the FCC web site. https://t.co/M8cUZG1hcF Yesterday's vote for my proposal w/@SenBobCorker shows the broad bipartisan support for reasserting Congress’ constitutional responsibility on trade. Falsely claiming ‘national security’ to levy tariffs, i.e. taxes, just hurts American consumers/workers: https://t.co/1MDoAEnJRB About to join @SquawkCNBC to discuss the need for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority on ‘national defense’ tariffs. https://t.co/fxvmbuc9rg Heading to the floor in a few minutes to discuss my and @SenBobCorker's amendment to restore Congress's authority on national security related tariffs. https://t.co/XJhSUaDOp6 RT @SenBobCorker: The Senate will hold a test vote today on our efforts with @SenToomey, @JeffFlake and others to ensure Congress plays a r… My statement on President Trump nominating Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. https://t.co/8hDTcMHrrO Had a very interesting conversation with some of the great individuals who work at the Drueding Center, a Philadelphia organization that helps those in need with transitional housing and child care. https://t.co/1j2WwpqTPB It was a pleasure to meet with Drs. Donald Generals and Judith Gay from the Community College of Philadelphia. They're working diligently to teach students the skills demanded by employers. https://t.co/bU82iD84p4 242 years ago, our founding fathers convened in Philadelphia to adopt a declaration of independence, beginning the greatest experiment in self-governance the world has ever known. As we celebrate today with friends and family, I wish everyone a happy and safe #IndependenceDay. https://t.co/BZ14qPQ6VU Vietnam veterans did not receive the recognition they deserved upon returning home. I'm working to make it right. It was an honor to be in Lackawanna Co. to thank some of these brave Americans for their service, sacrifice, and valor. https://t.co/W714jBheEw https://t.co/fwQIH028ve RT @FaceTheNation: 💬 SUNDAY: @margbrennan questions @SenToomey 

Toomey is among the GOP senators who have challenged @realDonaldTrump over… Moreover, whoever is nominated should understand the proper role of a judge is to apply the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written. I look forward to meeting with the President’s choice in the coming weeks. In the coming weeks, President Trump will announce a nominee to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. This person should be committed to the rule of law and ensuring everyone is treated fairly under it. Justice Anthony Kennedy has admirably served our nation for the past 30 years as a Supreme Court Justice. He will be remembered as a thoughtful and fair jurist. I thank Justice Kennedy for his service and wish him nothing but the best in the future. As any pet owner knows, our cats &amp; dogs can be more than just animals--they are our companions, helpers, &amp; family. There is no room in our society for the despicable trade of cat &amp; dog meat for human consumption. Read about my amendment w/@SenGillibrand: https://t.co/XHgMGkuhwt RT @SenBobCorker: More than 270 business and agriculture groups today sent a letter urging my colleagues to support legislation I authored… ICYMI: I joined @BloombergTV this afternoon to explain why it’s a bad idea for the administration to claim 'national security' as a reason to impose tariffs on steel from our closest allies. These taxes only harm American consumers + workers. https://t.co/n7xGRBde6f
