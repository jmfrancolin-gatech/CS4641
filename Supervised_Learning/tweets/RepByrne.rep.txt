https://t.co/STNqttt56V Again today, House Democrats blocked a vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I don't understand why anyone would be want to deny adequate medical care to a baby who survives an abortion. #ProLife This new green “deal” is totally unserious and nothing more than an effort to pander to the far Left activists. This plan is poorly thought out, horribly expensive, and puts progressivism over the American people. Let’s call it out for what it is.

https://t.co/fgwxEpFICr The guiding principle that underlies the American Democratic system is that the people, not institutions, hold the ultimate power. That’s why I'm pushing 2 solutions to make our gov't work better: term limits and a balanced budget amendment.

On the Armed Services Committee, I can fight for Alabama's many military installations and national defense programs, like the @Austal_USA shipyard in Mobile, #FortRucker in the Wiregrass, and @TeamRedstone in Huntsville. I'm excited to serve as a member of the Education and Labor Committee (@EdLaborGOP) and the Armed Services Committee (@HASCRepublicans) over the next two years.
