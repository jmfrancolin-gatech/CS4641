Join us at 9AM for our Bipartisan HBCU Caucus launch event.  @RepByrne @RepAdams https://t.co/f2OXs46UXh ok! @staceyabrams yaaassss!

It‚Äôs time for step two of criminal justice reform, and that is why I invited Cedric as my guest. #StateOfTheUnion2019 Tonight I have Cedric Dean with me. He‚Äôs a testament to the need for continued reforms. The First Step Act was just that, a first step towards reforms. It‚Äôs time to move with more reforms within in all courts and at all levels. #StateOfTheUnion2019 It‚Äôs one thing to talk on a staff-prepared teleprompter, and it‚Äôs another to actually govern and lead.  Actions will always speak louder than words. #StateOfTheUnion2019 RT @MSNBC: US House Democratic women dressed in white for Tuesday night's #SOTU pose together on a spiral staircase on Capitol Hill.

https://t.co/ewdnIvOD37 Last year‚Äôs First STEP Act was just that ‚Äì a first step.  There is still so much work to be done. Cedric and I will send a message to President Trump and Congress that we need to continue our efforts to truly reform our criminal justice system. There are striking inequities in our criminal justice system and it is clear that we are over-criminalizing and over-processing certain communities and crimes. For women, incarceration is up 700% with African American women six times more likely to be incarcerated than white women, and Latinas are twice as likely. Half of African American men will be arrested at some point in their lives. Right here in NC, African Americans account for 52% of the incarcerated population and only 28% of the state‚Äôs total population I am proud to bring Cedric Dean as my guest of honor to the #SOTU. Cedric spent over 28 years in prison on two felony charges. Thanks to vital sentencing reforms he was given an opportunity to win back his freedom. https://t.co/8oRLjCDgOc Today, I am announcing my SOTU guest. His story is one of perseverance and overcoming overwhelming obstacles. His experiences are all too common, and it‚Äôs time for us to work together to address it. Today for #BlackHistoryMonth we honor Septima Poinsette Clark. A civil right activists who created citizenship schools that helped many African Americans vote. She was also active with NAACP in getting more black teachers hired in the south. https://t.co/MR5iCEuASg On Monday, February 4th, I will be announcing who will be my guest to the State of the Union.

Thank you for providing a strong platform and a voice for all Members of Congress, especially women of Color. @thebeatdc https://t.co/Db9piRjvd7 He truly is the Grinch who stole Christmas. #TrumpChristmasShutdown https://t.co/UhrY0wZaks Congressional Republicans managed to find 5.7 billion dollars for a stack of bricks, but they couldn‚Äôt find it to help working families deal with the soaring cost of healthcare, provide quality education for their children or access food when in need? #TrumpsShutdown https://t.co/gch3iBMBCF RT @RepBobbyRush: With all the talk about the #TrumpShutdown, there‚Äôs a great deal of confusion about what that actually means. Here‚Äôs a qu‚Ä¶ Read my full statement on the ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© Shutdown https://t.co/xlAjqN9kxb . @realDonaldTrump is the shutdown President. This is unacceptable &amp; we deserve better. It‚Äôs bewildering that the President rejected a funding measure introduced by Senate Republicans w/broad bipartisan support. Republicans have given the American people a shutdown for Christmas. You know your immigration policies are purely hate based when not even a conservative controlled Supreme Court upholds your efforts.  #TrumpFail https://t.co/ST3bFikGv9 Justice Ginsburg is in our thoughts and prayers.  We wish her a speedy recovery. https://t.co/LtDkC6SBXU Is the @HBCUCaucus invited? This sounds amazing and we are proud of @AlfredStreetBC heard work and steadfast commitment to our students and schools. https://t.co/0p1N8j3nyY No, the fact is you don't have the votes in the Senate, nor will you have the majority in the House on Jan. 3rd.  The American people have spoken.  #Petty #NoWall https://t.co/0ffII2OPUv We will NOT fund a frivolous wall that does nothing to achieve true border security. For @realDonaldTrump and House Republicans to hold our government hostage over a pile of bricks is a pathetic political stunt. Is it 2020 yet? #TrumpShutdown 5 days before Christmas and we are facing yet another Trump manufactured shutdown.  Congress already agreed to a bipartisan stop-gap measure, so when will @realDonaldTrump finally put aside his messy politics and childish antics to do right by the American people? #Grinch Voting in support of the First Step Act.  This legislation is a step in the right direction and an example of bipartisan compromise.  While progress has been made, there is still great work to be done to eliminate the inequities within our criminal justice system. #CJReform The continued lack of leadership and sound judgment displayed by @realDonaldTrump is frightening.  To deny holiday paychecks to millions of Americans over an unnecessary border wall is shameful. https://t.co/CTVMQCOFJg See my official statement on the enactment of the North Carolina Voter ID Laws that were passed by the North Carolina General Assembly. https://t.co/dYyIO4l3VA This isn't surprising - yet another thinly veiled attempt by NC Republicans to suppress the vote.  Instead of combating non-existent voter fraud, Republicans should look in the mirror and end the kinds of practices we saw in NC09. https://t.co/j7nbOrEVGx Excellent news!  @MeckCounty is a hub of innovation with an impressive workforce. Our county continues to be a top destination for employers. Now, we must work together to ensure that these opportunities are available to all. #OneMeck https://t.co/IXaAcf7OLY My deepest condolences to the loved ones of Former Duke Energy CEO, Jim Rogers. Rogers was a leader within our community and a true visionary. He will be missed. https://t.co/EDxFmd6sDz Today marks the 115th Anniversary of the first flight taken by the Wright Brothers near Kitty Hawk.  North Carolina is proud to be ‚ÄúFirst in Flight.‚Äù Our Great State continues to lead in innovation and discovery.  #WrightBrothersDay https://t.co/HX80BmgVg5 This is long overdue. https://t.co/68XbhqHt0v Aggie Pride!  We are the champions. #BackToBack https://t.co/BR1gSSTq2p TODAY is the last day for Open Enrollment. Be sure to #getcovered on https://t.co/jq1sZ6Z2ej. https://t.co/2G1xe0MeFD Good news! https://t.co/fWzlUCceRd Last night I issued the below statement regarding the Texas Court decision striking down the ACA.  We will not allow this evil spirited and politically charged ruling strip healthcare from millions of Americans. https://t.co/4tYbkVdPYP RT @NCEmergency: There is potential for localized flooding or flash flooding in areas across NC this weekend due to heavy precipitation. Fl‚Ä¶ Today, the Adams Hunger Initiative joined with @LoavesFishesNC for our annual day of service. Volunteers from across the county, helped assemble boxes of food to send to those in need. Thank you to the volunteers and Adams Hunger Initiative for committing your time to serve. https://t.co/8aKpp3WzFh Today, I released the below statement with my colleagues @GKButterfield @RepDavidPrice regarding the NC-09 election fraud. https://t.co/BUKnE4YhtZ Join the Adams Hunger Initiative TODAY from 2pm-4pm at @loavesfishesnc as we #ServeToEndHunger

https://t.co/wPfBYDJidZ https://t.co/mUiPLY8t1x Deeply troubling report. This is a painful reminder of the dangerous consequences of the administration's hostile immigration policies.  What policy or practice allowed this to happen? We must investigate and demand answers. No child deserves this. https://t.co/hQcDdDBQ7J RT @NC_Governor: North Carolinians without health insurance, and those currently getting health care through the exchange, need to enroll f‚Ä¶ Every day men &amp; women sit in American jails with less evidence against them than @realDonaldTrump . Our criminal justice system is steeped in inequity. As we move forward with reform we must remember that true justice is blind &amp; no one is above the law. May we never forget the 20 children and 6 staff members that were shot and killed at #SandyHook 6 years ago. Gun violence has taken far too many of our loved ones. As legislators, the best way we can honor their memory is to address the epidemic that claimed their lives. https://t.co/f4RMN6lRkK The 9th District Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump Administration‚Äôs cut back of the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs guarantee to birth control coverage in five states. This is a major win, I will continue to fight for women‚Äôs full access to healthcare. https://t.co/odp8N2Dgce Join  the Adams Hunger Initiative TOMORROW from 2pm-4pm at @loavesfishesnc as we #ServeToEndHunger
RSVP to volunteer  with us https://t.co/d7bRmBOCag https://t.co/3CrTieB4ft RT @RepAdams: Looking for affordable healthcare? 8 in 10 people get covered for less than $75 per month. #Getcovered TODAY and head over to‚Ä¶ My office and I are monitoring the recent multiple bomb threats in Charlotte and advising everyone to be vigilant.  Thank you to our first responders! Don‚Äôt allow @POTUS to sabotage your healthcare!  There are TWO days left to enroll - Go to https://t.co/jq1sZ6Z2ej out to see quality and affordable coverage options for you and your family. The Trump Administration is obsessed with killing the ACA and preventing millions of Americans from accessing affordable healthcare. Since 2017, there have been dozens of attempts to undermine this historic healthcare law: https://t.co/EuPJQFeLYf Yesterday, the Sunlight Foundation released a report about the sabotage the Trump Administration has undergone to turn people away from Open Enrollment by removing critical information from the official website about signing up by phone or mail. Read the full report below: https://t.co/P52vLH0Zel Tomorrow marks one year since the FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. Over the past year, millions of Americans have voiced their support for restoring #NetNeutrality rules - and it is time for Congress to listen. I will continue to fight for the free and open internet!
