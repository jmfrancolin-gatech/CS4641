This not only adds $1.5 trillion to the  deficit, but it widens the already giant income inequality gap in our country. #TaxScam Speaker @pryan tweeted about a secretary whose pay went up $1.50 a week after the Republican tax bill. He deleted the tweet when he realized Americans are  seeing minuscule increases to their monthly incomes. Meanwhile, 83% of the benefits go to the top 1% and corporations. https://t.co/QeLBrZX8fN By recklessly ignoring the FBI's counsel, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have put our national security at risk. Further, they continue to distract  the American people from the important work being done by Special Counsel Mueller. On a range of issues facing our nation, President Trump has failed to govern responsibly. His #sotu speech has done nothing but double down on failed policies ‚Äîwhile creating distractions ‚Äî and outright lying to the American people. üö´ I welcome the President to the conversation on national paid family leave. My bill, the #FAMILYAct, sets the gold standard for working families. #sotu On infrastructure, I‚Äôve championed the national infrastructure bank for better public-private infrastructure projects. That‚Äôs the kind of infrastructure improvement we need, not an infrastructure bill that‚Äôs a disguise for more tax cuts for the wealthy. #sotu RT @NPWF: Mr. President, for your consideration. This is what real #paidleave looks like. #PaidLeaveChecklist #SOTU https://t.co/w1vSxW8FX4 Too many working families today cannot make ends meet. The middle-class deserves an economy that works for everyone, not those with the most lobbyists. #sotu https://t.co/jtCDkgSSlO 83% of the benefits in the Republican Tax Scam go to the top 1%. This reckless tax bill incentivizes multi-national corporations to ship jobs overseas and further stacks the deck against working, middle-class families. #SOTU My guest for the #SOTU tonight is Suzanne Lagarde, CEO of @FairHavenCHC in New Haven. We must support the work of our community health centers as they are the primary health care provider for over 27 million people, including disproportionately rural and low-income populations. I'm wearing black to the #SOTU¬† in solidarity with the brave women and men who are working every day to eradicate sexual assault and harassment from our society. The stories they have courageously shared must be heard. #MeToo¬† #TimesUp RT @PPFA: Sarah Weddington was 27 when she argued Roe v. Wade  ‚Äî the youngest person ever to win in the Supreme Court. Today is the 45th an‚Ä¶ Click here to watch my video on the #womensmarch and what it means: https://t.co/m08fyiuf66 https://t.co/5wVppxmPUQ President Trump has called for a shutdown of government. Look, he even said he wants a ‚Äúgood shutdown‚Äù 9 months ago! President Trump and Republicans in Congress are not moving forward on behalf of the American people. They are creating chaos and hurting working families. https://t.co/UPPwWXUN7T Dr. King told us that ‚ÄúDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.‚Äù In honor of this great man and his revolutionary vision, we must face our challenges with courage ‚Äîand work for the future he dreamed of. #MLKDay Dr. King said ‚Äúour lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.‚Äù It can be tempting to give in to cynicism, or to become so discouraged by tragedy and prejudice that you just want to give up. But we must honor Dr. King‚Äôs legacy with action. #MLKDay Republicans in Congress let the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expire and have yet to reauthorize it. America‚Äôs children deserve to have their prescriptions, shots, and emergency hospital visits insured. Sign your name if you agree: https://t.co/Io0WXTGUxf Wishing you a very Healthy and Happy New Year. üåü Looking towards 2018, I am more determined than ever to continue fighting for you and your family each and every day. Each and every day we have seen how people can work together to make a positive difference in the lives of families in every community. Our collective efforts will only be strengthened as we look towards a new year. Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a wonderful holiday season. https://t.co/rQzVyFAHaV My book, "The Least Among Us: Waging the Battle for the #Vulnerable" talks about helping one another, especially in times of need.
That is why I am calling on the Dept of Health &amp; Human Services to clarify this directive. We should not be censoring our public health experts. The Trump Administration does not want to hear the words  ‚Äúentitlement,‚Äù ‚Äúdiversity,‚Äù ‚Äútransgender,‚Äù ‚Äúfetus,‚Äù ‚Äúevidence-based,‚Äù ‚Äúscience-based‚Äù or even ‚Äúvulnerable.‚Äù  The recent reports of censorship at our nation‚Äôs health agencies are extremely troubling. Republicans in Congress are working to make sure they vote on the tax bill before Doug Jones is seated. The people of Alabama voted for Doug Jones, and that should be reflected in votes moving forward. SIGN: No vote on taxes until Doug Jones is sworn in: https://t.co/t07kJDNajg #HappyHanukkah Wishing you and your family love and light. The 17 women who accused @realDonaldTrump of sexual misconduct deserve to be heard. I am joining the House Democratic Women in calling for a full Congressional investigation of these allegations against  President Trump. Thank you for having me at @ByrdsBooks for a discussion about #theLeastAmongUs. https://t.co/CjgXmewdrT
