I wrote a provision into the defense bill that would increase the amount of #paidleave offered to parents and caregivers in our military. Glad to hear that the Army is finally implementing this change to strengthen our military families! https://t.co/uI7UJRD13b Any drug company that would place profits over patients' access to life saving medicine must be held accountable for price gouging. 

Proud to partner with @SenSherrodBrown on a bill to solve this problem now. https://t.co/1LLta95E5p Just introduced legislation with @SenatorCollins and @SenJackReed to #ProtectTransTroops. We should end the president's discriminatory ban and ensure that transgender service members can continue to do their jobs, serve with dignity, and protect our country. https://t.co/snpm8T3v3Q We can't wait another second for bold, meaningful action on climate change. 
 
We can solve this crisis and prevent catastrophe. But we must all rise to the challenge. 
 
I'm proud to join @SenMarkey, @RepAOC and colleagues across Congress on an historic #GreenNewDeal resolution. What happened at #MDCBrooklyn was completely unacceptable. Today, I joined @NydiaVelasquez, @JerryNadler and several House and Senate colleagues to demand a full review from the DOJ Inspector General and the BOP. We'll fight to ensure that this never happens again. https://t.co/LnCutx3b5t My thoughts on tonight’s State of the Union speech. #SOTU https://t.co/LkYYa01r40 Honored to welcome my special guest, Lt. Commander Blake Dremann, to the Capitol for tonight’s #SOTU.
 
He's a decorated Navy Lt. Commander, one of thousands of transgender service members serving our nation with honor and distinction. 
 
I'm so thrilled that he's here! https://t.co/cg6Ab6bOpv Xinnian kuaile! Wishing a very happy #LunarNewYear to all who are celebrating. I hope that the #YearOfThePig brings prosperous opportunities and happiness to all. I’ll continue to stand up for current and future transgender service members, and lead the fight against the president's hateful ban. Following #SOTU, I'll introduce new legislation to ensure that any transgender American who meets the standards can join our Armed Forces. Transgender service members like Lt. Commander Dremann make extraordinary sacrifices every day to defend our freedom and most sacred values. President Trump’s decision to ban them from military service is cruel and undermines military readiness. #SOTU Lt. Commander Blake Dremann is one of thousands of transgender Americans serving in our military with honor and distinction. He's been deployed 11 times and won the Navy’s highest logistics award. I’m inspired by his leadership—and honored that he'll be my #SOTU guest. I’ve written to Acting Attorney General Whitaker and BOP Acting Director Hurwitz to demand immediate action to fix the inhumane conditions at #MDCBrooklyn. https://t.co/jL6IcoKGvr Saddened to hear of the passing of Chief Warrant Officer Michael Kozloski from Mahopac, New York, who served his country faithfully for nearly two decades. Sending my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. https://t.co/tUbw9qQYCy I spoke on the phone with the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons regarding the situation at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn—and urged him to fix this inhumane situation immediately. #MDC It’s been reported that since Monday, detainees at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn have had limited power and heat in freezing temperatures.
 
My team and I are deeply concerned. We're looking into this situation and demanding answers &amp; accountability. https://t.co/g8qcXlvARA February is #BlackHistoryMonth, when we celebrate the ways the Black community has shaped—and will continue to shape—our nation. Let's celebrate the accomplishments of this community and recognize the remaining work we all must do to tackle institutional racism and injustice. This ruling is long overdue for our Blue Water Navy Vets. The VA should honor this decision immediately—and we must continue to fight to pass our bipartisan legislation to ensure that all Blue Water Vets receive the benefits they are owed. https://t.co/LHvLDa5nTI After meeting with @EPA nominee Andrew Wheeler this morning, I've decided to vote against his confirmation. Under his watch as acting administrator, the EPA is shirking its responsibility to protect New Yorkers' health and well-being. https://t.co/2SUplVyTvI Our nation’s interstate highway system remains one of the most transformative achievements in our history—but, like in the case of I-81 in Syracuse, it all too often hurts marginalized communities. We can't afford to repeat those mistakes. https://t.co/ivTbOPhTfp .@BetsyDeVosED's Title IX proposals are a betrayal of survivors of sexual assault on college campuses and in all our schools.

We must never forget this dark chapter of history, and vow to ensure that such atrocities never happen again. Foster children a need loving home, no matter what religion is practiced by their foster parents. This move is appalling. The federal government should never allow, much less encourage, this kind of religious discrimination. https://t.co/JvyFzbzmQD President Trump has finally agreed to end this absurd shutdown and the unnecessary suffering inflicted upon 800,000 federal workers. It shouldn't have taken this long. Flights into LaGuardia Airport were delayed this morning due to a shortage of air traffic control staff. All because of this pointless government shutdown. These are the people who ensure our flight safety! This is absurd. Open the government. https://t.co/DbfvGBVo6k We need to take the problem of climate change seriously and seek bold, innovative, and inclusive solutions. I’m urging Congress to support a #GreenNewDeal: https://t.co/xtewfEh6Cl Climate change is real. The evidence is now overwhelming that if we don’t act immediately to stop it, our lives will all be upended in potentially catastrophic ways. It’s time for Congress to get serious about this severe threat and support a #GreenNewDeal. For 34 days, the shutdown has impacted 800k federal workers who've been going without pay. It's threatening basic public health and safety. And it's taking a toll on millions of Americans who cannot access the services they need. It's time to stop this nonsense. #EndtheShutdown High-quality child care can lead to better outcomes for our kids—but families across New York and the country are concerned about rising costs. @SenatorShaheen, @SenBrianSchatz, @SenAmyKlobuchar and I are re-introducing a bill to expand access: https://t.co/I11MKtgNoI Transgender service members have been serving openly with honor and distinction. They're willing to die for this country, for our freedom, for our values. This decision is a rebuke of their patriotism and will undermine military readiness by plunging their lives into uncertainty. https://t.co/yHbpSyHp8w The government has been shut down for almost 27 days. Instead of voting to end the shutdown, @SenateGOP leadership is moving forward on a bill to restrict coverage of reproductive health services! 

Stop playing politics with people's lives. Call a vote to end this shutdown. We've lost far too many from horrific truck underride collisions. These deaths are preventable, and we must act. 
 
I'll keep fighting to pass my bipartisan legislation, the Stop Underrides Act, which would ensure truck safety and save lives.

https://t.co/Q5iLYb7Fsw Neomi Rao, who was just nominated to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the DC Circuit court, has no business being anywhere near the federal bench. https://t.co/HDGkbLwo3K Your reminder that the government has been shutdown for 25 days – the longest government shutdown in American history. Enough is enough. The president must stop playing politics with people’s lives and re-open the government. I’m re-introducing the MOMS Act, which would take important steps to address our nation’s growing maternal mortality crisis. 
 
We need to do more to protect new mothers. And we need to do more to end institutional racism in our health care system. Here's how my bill would do it: https://t.co/sj3i17zEIX The president is putting his ineffective and wasteful border wall over the lives and health of millions of Americans. It’s unacceptable. This shutdown must end. RT @poststar: Gillibrand names two Saratoga County students for service academy https://t.co/ZxmyHHb16z Families are at risk of losing SNAP benefits. Domestic violence shelters are risk of closing. 800k federal workers and contractors aren't being paid. Thousands more are being denied access to basic services.

We deserve better. 

It's time for the president to end this shutdown. Just went to the House floor to see my friend @GabbyGiffords be honored for her strength and bravery. https://t.co/8cFwetW4OK Today, @NydiaVelazquez, @SenSchumer, @SenWarren, @SenKamalaHarris and I announced legislation to create a new, 9/11-style Congressional commission to investigate exactly how and why the federal government abandoned its responsibilities and turned its back on Puerto Rico. The storms were bad enough, but the government’s response to them was truly horrific — especially when the island was already reeling from an economic disaster.

We need to get to the bottom of exactly what went so terribly wrong. 15 months after the devastation of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, it’s clear that Congress and the president have failed to protect Puerto Rico and the millions of Americans who live there. In my office right before my swearing in. Yes, we did eventually get some lunch for Senator Henry! https://t.co/A0qLS2fbW2 Each day that I get to serve New York in the U.S. Senate is a privilege, and I'm particularly grateful for this moment. Today, I was proud to be sworn into the 116th Congress alongside a historic number of women serving! 
 
Much work lies ahead. It's an honor to fight for you. https://t.co/IHX10kVmQK With each passing minute, @realDonaldTrump's shutdown inflicts harm on the livelihoods of workers who provide vital government services and keep us safe. He should end this nonsense and accept the offer that Democrats have put on the table to reopen our government. Happy Holidays! This time is one of my favorite parts of the year — I hope you are having a great one with your family and loved ones. https://t.co/RbrJFi7CXo Our country's cash bail system keeps thousands in New York locked up every year, even if they haven’t been convicted of a crime. And an extremely high number of them are people of color.
 
I stood with @TheRevAl, @NYSNAACP, @BrennanCenter to call on Congress to solve this. https://t.co/9l1prfgege For the past 16 years, the VA has excluded Blue Water Navy vets, who were exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, from needed health benefits because of an arbitrary rule.
 
This week, one Senator blocked the passage of a bipartisan bill to help them.
 
That's shameful. https://t.co/jCNdI9p2xJ RT @architectmag: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced the allocation of $16 million in FEMA funds to the New York State Pavilion… The Trump administration has been dragging its feet on implementing a new law that would help end the use of dangerous PFAS chemicals at airports across New York and the country. Today, I called for the immediate implementation of this law by the @FAANews: https://t.co/2DAJbyEPqE Three talented actors from Iran and Syria overcame huge challenges to obtain the visas they needed to perform in @TheJungleUS, a play spotlighting refugees around the world.

We have to keep working toward sustainable solutions – and we have to keep speaking out. Today, I’m so proud to introduce new legislation to rename the Manhattan VA Medical Center after this Revolutionary War hero, who paved the way for countless other women to serve and protect our country. https://t.co/FhI7CyQDMS Corbin was awarded a lifelong pension, making her the first woman to receive a pension from the U.S. through military service. She passed away in 1789 in Highland Falls, New York and she is honored nearby at West Point, where she is honored as a hero of the Revolutionary War. On Nov. 16, 1776, Margaret Corbin took her husband’s place at the battle of Fort Washington in Manhattan after he was fatally wounded.
 
She was then shot by enemy fire and severely wounded. https://t.co/tvO6x1oig0 Yesterday, I had the chance to take part in the @RedCross’s Holiday Mail for Heroes program, which encourages members of the community to send cards to patients and wounded warriors @WalterReedArmy. https://t.co/9OCDYhbvRy Today, the Senate advanced the nomination of Kathy Kraninger to lead the @CFPB. Aside from being opposed to consumer protections, she played a central role in Trump's inhumane family separation policy at our border. I am voting NO and urge my colleagues to reject this nomination. Today is the #NetNeutrality Day of Action. Americans across the country support #NetNeutrality, but with less than a month left for Congress to overturn the FCC's repeal, we must keep speaking out to restore a free and open internet. It is horrific that, in 2018, we must keep having to read stories like this. 
 
There is no place in our communities for vile, anti-Semitic behavior and we must keep coming together to condemn it. 
 
https://t.co/NE9QuyrmR8 We need bold new ideas to solve the imminent threat of global climate change. So let’s start now. Let’s put a price on carbon.

Please stay warm and look out for each other. If your heat or hot water goes out, make sure to call 311 right away for assistance. Very sad to hear of the sudden passing of State Senator José Peralta. He was a dedicated public servant to Queens and to the entire state of New York. Sending strength, prayers, and love to his family and loved ones. I am so grateful to have the honor of representing New Yorkers in the U.S. Senate, and look forward to the work we will accomplish together in the weeks and months ahead. Wishing you and your family a very #HappyThanksgiving! https://t.co/3YLp2DKzeU As a Federal Judge, Farr will have the power to reinforce the hate &amp; divisiveness that President Trump continues to sow in this country. It’s clear that Farr’s positions &amp; record disqualify him from a lifetime appointment. I urge my Senate colleagues to #StopFarr’s confirmation. Farr has spent his entire career working to undermine voting rights for African Americans and communities of color.

He is a known architect of voter suppression in North Carolina. 

He has defended discrimination against workers, women, and LGBTQ Americans. Right after the Thanksgiving holiday, Senate Republicans will push through on a vote to confirm federal judiciary nominee Thomas Farr. I am vehemently opposed to his nomination.

It is our moral obligation for Congress to secure and permanently renew this program. https://t.co/Mt4xQnVy4a Congress needs to do the right thing and pass a bipartisan bill to permanently reauthorize the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.
Anything less would send a cruel message to our heroes and their families. https://t.co/A1noLjRXBs The Mueller investigation should proceed without interference by the president or anyone else. It is clear that the American people want answers, transparency, and accountability. We must keep speaking out until Congress passes the bipartisan bill to protect this investigation. https://t.co/tHaQgo5dIi But the only way we will accomplish that is through negotiations that create conditions of security and economic well-being — not through rocket attacks or any other acts of terrorism. I urge calm so the situation does not further escalate, and I still remain hopeful for a long-term, peaceful solution to this tragic conflict. The escalation in violence on the Israel-Gaza border is deeply disturbing, and I am relieved that Israel’s missile defense programs were able to keep civilians safe from this disgraceful terror attack. https://t.co/NyCnjtYZ19 As we celebrate #VeteransDay, I think about the suffering of our Blue Water Navy Vets, who've waited for 16 years for the VA to cover them for Agent Orange exposure. We've been fighting hard to pass legislation to protect them. It's time to get this done. https://t.co/dovGupFSCJ On #VeteransDay and every day, let's thank our veterans for their selfless service — and for the sacrifices that they and their families made each day for our country. Our women veterans were willing to give their lives to this country. I will always do everything in my power to make sure their service and sacrifices are given the respect they deserve. https://t.co/Tv7cDFXGrS We must keep working until we have a health care system that values people over the profits of insurance companies.

This could exacerbate our country's already-dire maternal mortality crisis. #NoJunkPlans I’m voting to repeal the Trump administration’s expansion of “junk insurance” plans that allow insurance companies to deny coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. We must keep fighting back against Republican attempts to sabotage our health care system. #NoJunkPlans I’m pleased that the FAA Reauthorization Bill left intact stronger entry-level experience requirements for regional airline first officers. This will help ensure that preventable mistakes that led to accidents like #Flight3407 never happen again. https://t.co/kk936bDjue Too many women across this country have died before, during, and after childbirth from preventable and treatable conditions.

Wade — and all of the progress we’ve made for women’s reproductive rights — at risk. We cannot let this country criminalize abortion. We must keep fighting against this nomination. #StopKavanaugh This is outrageous. Kavanaugh refused to answer whether a president can be above the law. This is not a hypothetical, so let’s be clear: No one is above the law. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/acpGyJ0act Kavanaugh’s nomination is a clear threat to rights that women all across America hold most dear. 

With his confirmation hearings underway, we must all speak out. 
 
Because we are #WhatsAtStake. And this fight is far from over. https://t.co/rMF92cW5uX Across our country, women are dying in childbirth from preventable and treatable conditions. There's no excuse for it. The MOMS Act would help hospitals monitor mothers before, during, and after they give birth. Let's do #MoreforMOMs and help end this crisis. https://t.co/fsJqo86g9w We have to do #MoreforMOMS. We need to protect and value mothers, and I hope you’ll speak out so that we can finally address the urgent crisis of maternal mortality — and help end racial disparities in our healthcare system. This is a crisis that we can and must solve now. Today, I introduced a bill, the MOMS Act, which would help our hospitals monitor mothers before, during, and after they give birth. It would also provide them with the federal funding they need to effectively treat patients. https://t.co/v78fE7hdMq In our state, it’s particularly bad. New York has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, and in the last decade, the rate has gone up by 60%. In New York City, black women are 12x more likely than white women to die from pregnancy &amp; childbirth. The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world. Women are dying in childbirth from preventable &amp; treatable conditions. The rates are worse for black women, who are up to 4x more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications.

It's inexcusable. https://t.co/WBpv19dTSq A recent report revealed that @DeptVetAffairs mishandled more than a thousand claims involving military sexual trauma. Along with @SenDougJones, I called on the VA to review denied claims and implement reforms to ensure that these cases are properly reviewed. Read our letter: https://t.co/vM3jnUytub I had such a blast today at the @NYSFair in Syracuse. You have to make it up there to try the world famous sausage! https://t.co/Ai4H5AIEI7 Kavanaugh's nomination to SCOTUS is a threat to women's reproductive freedom. Across the country, states have made significant moves to limit a woman's access to abortion. Imagine what could happen with a SCOTUS justice who's in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/zKL9b4QRwq Make no mistake: The Trump administration's Clean Power Plan "replacement" will make it far easier for the coal industry to pollute our air. This will undoubtedly impact our most vulnerable communities in New York and across the country. https://t.co/COvJ3MswDD If Kavanaugh is handed a lifetime appointment to SCOTUS, it would threaten the future of affordable, accessible health care for women — and particularly women of color. I’m joining @maziehirono, @SenDuckworth and women’s advocates to speak out. Watch live: https://t.co/P3Ijdyp0Eh As the Rochester-Finger Lakes and Southern Tier regions recover from last week’s severe weather, they need to be assured that the federal government will be ready to assist them if necessary. @SenSchumer and I are urging FEMA to be prepared to help. https://t.co/nFUlHm2ImA This weekend, I went to @sunysflk to hear directly from members of the Long Island agricultural community about their thoughts and concerns regarding their industries and the agricultural economy. Appreciated the thoughtful discussion! https://t.co/ffoInP84XY For any safety tips during floods and all other types of weather events head to: https://t.co/U3BMw46Q1D For assistance, call the NYS Flood Assistance Hotline at 866-697-2434. And to receive critical alerts: https://t.co/wHG15E2fNQ Due to flash flooding, a state of emergency has been declared for several regions across New York. If you live in the Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, or Central New York, please stay safe and informed. Here are some helpful resources: A new @NPWF survey shows that 84% of voters support a comprehensive national paid family leave program that covers all workers. It is long past time to get this done. Here's why Congress should pass the #FAMILYAct: https://t.co/MQe5KxfWcS RT @ESOPAssociation: The Main Street Employee Ownership Act, which passed the House in May, has now passed the Senate as well. Thank you @S… TODAY: Join us at @PrattInstitute for our Brooklyn Town Hall! You still have time to RSVP: https://t.co/NKBFmqgOip You still have time to RSVP for tonight’s town hall in Morningside Heights. We hope to see you there! Get all the details: https://t.co/CvwoBWlqpB NEW: I'm holding a Community Meeting in the Bronx at @BCCcuny on Friday, August 10th. I would love to hear from you! If you can join us, RSVP here: https://t.co/WrNJfKD5vH A new report shows that the wage gap in New York City widened to 43 cents between black women and white men in 2016. We must all #DemandMore together. Raise your voice on this #BlackWomensEqualPay Day. https://t.co/PFbS8mK5SN Health care should be a right, not a privilege. It's time to fight for universal coverage and pass #MedicareforAll, for the families in New York and across the country who are counting on us. https://t.co/HKOXLCVBFk NEW: On Thursday, August 9th, I’m hosting a town hall at @PrattInstitute in Brooklyn. Hope to see you there! RSVP → https://t.co/NKBFmpZcTP NEW: I'm hosting a town hall on Wednesday, August 8th at @RiversideNYC in Morningside Heights. If you're in New York City, please join us! I would love to hear from you. RSVP here: https://t.co/CvwoBWlqpB Thousands of Blue Water Navy #Veterans are suffering harmful health effects from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. But to this day, many haven't received benefits they deserve from @DeptVetAffairs. It's an injustice that the Senate can &amp; must rectify. https://t.co/dovGupFSCJ We all know #WhatsAtStake. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, then women’s rights are going to come under attack. This judge is the wrong choice for our country. In front of the Capitol, I joined advocates from across the country and @SenateDems in speaking out to #StopKavanaugh. https://t.co/qioybxYs1p This is such great news for our communities. I hope to continue to do everything I can to make sure that our schools have the resources they need to better prepare students for high-quality jobs, no matter where they are in the state. Companies across New York have many high-tech jobs available, and these provisions will help train students with the technical and computing skills they need to fill these jobs. I am so excited to announce that important provisions from two of my bipartisan bills, the Computer Science Career Education Act and the 21st Century SHOP CLASS Act, have just been signed into law as part of the Career and Technical Education re-authorization. Had a great time at the @POK_WaterMarket in Poughkeepsie this afternoon! https://t.co/WWc1NPr5AB 53 years ago, Medicare &amp; Medicaid became law, giving millions access to quality health care. Today, President Trump &amp; the GOP are proposing to cut them to pay for the #GOPTaxScam benefiting the top 1% &amp; big corporations. We must fight to protect these vital services. #Medicare53 The Trump administration must be held accountable for the hundreds of children still waiting to be reunited with their parents. They deserve justice, not incompetence or cruelty. #FamiliesBelongTogether If confirmed, Brett Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act. 

#WhatsAtStake is healthcare for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. The Senate must reject his nomination. Make your voice heard. https://t.co/KYc9gtbEnO The career &amp; technical education bill that passed Congress &amp; is expected to be signed into law included major provisions from two of my bills. Schools across #NY will get access to funding for new types of technical training to better prepare our students. https://t.co/o21JAqFjew Before Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last September, the island was more than $70 billion in debt. This week, I announced a bill with @SenWarren, @SenKamalaHarris, @SenMarkey &amp; @SenSanders to help give these American citizens a path to relief. https://t.co/bRnRskT5uN In the face of another missed deadline by the Trump administration, it is our responsibility to stand up and fight for the remaining separated families. We must keep speaking out for their immediate reunification. #FamiliesBelongTogether The transgender troop ban is disgraceful and disrespects the thousands of transgender service members who are bravely serving our country.
 
One year after @realDonaldTrump tweeted this ban, we’re standing strong to #ProtectTransTroops. https://t.co/wkQeRtolug On July 26th, 1788, the Convention of the State of New York met in Poughkeepsie and voted to ratify the U.S. Constitution. That day, New York became the 11th state to join the union.
 
Wishing a very happy 230th birthday to New York State! One year ago, @realDonaldTrump announced one of the most disgraceful policies of his presidency. Let's keep up the fight for transgender Americans who want to serve, and for all transgender troops already serving — because they never stopped fighting for us. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/0y5u7RKPBl Trump separated over 2,500 children from families at our border. The families that have yet to be reunited have suffered enough because this admin never had a plan. We can't accept permanent orphans due to ideological politics, incompetence, and cruelty. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/hzv2ZoVCC6 One of the best parts of my job as a Senator is hearing directly from New Yorkers about what's on their minds—that's why I love holding town halls across the state. This past weekend, I headed to Staten Island. Was glad to answer many thoughtful questions! https://t.co/vJJlNyvvLC The United States remains the only industrialized country in the world that doesn’t guarantee some form of paid leave for workers. It is long past time to fix this problem. 

Here's why the #FAMILYAct is the best national #paidleave plan for workers, businesses, and the country: https://t.co/B26aV914BF It is an honor and privilege to serve New Yorkers every single day in the U.S. Senate.
