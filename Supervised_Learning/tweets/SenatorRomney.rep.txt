Welcomed Navajo Nation President @NNPrezNez and other Nation leaders to the office this week.

Proud the Senate passed a resolution this week to rename the North Ogden @DeptVetAffairs Outstation in his name. https://t.co/JJwaIia18b The people we love, the friendships we have, our associations with one another‚Äîthis is the real currency in life. By this measure, Major Brent Taylor was an extraordinarily wealthy man. Today, we honored the life of this great man and his family. https://t.co/UxF32hzrhI Speaking with @BoydMatheson now on @kslnewsradio. Listen here: https://t.co/MMS8trls0Q While I welcome efforts by the administration to reach a political solution in Afghanistan and eliminate ISIS in Syria, I believe that ‚Äì based on conditions on the ground ‚Äì we must maintain a sufficient U.S. presence in both places to protect our national security interests. When it comes to foreign policy, I have been encouraged by the administration‚Äôs decisions to support the people of Venezuela and take a hard line against Iranian aggression. The Trump Administration deserves credit for working to cut taxes and regulations, which have helped boost our economy and raise wages. He highlighted several critical policy areas where there are opportunities for both parties to work together ‚Äì including lowering health care costs, reforming trade policies to better protect American workers, and strengthening border security and immigration enforcement. The president‚Äôs speech was strong, well-delivered, and appealed to our patriotism and common values as Americans.

Both parties must work together in the next three weeks on a final agreement that funds border security and avoids another shutdown. Utahns have been clear‚Äîend the shutdown and secure the border. I voted today to do both. With both measures having failed, it‚Äôs time now for Republican and Democratic leaders to come together and negotiate a final deal that funds border security and reopens the government.

I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same. The Beehive State is a great place to do business. I encourage more businesses to take advantage of Utah‚Äôs fast-growing economy and consider setting up shop in rural and urban Utah. Because of Utah‚Äôs fast-growing economy, Davis Smith chose Salt Lake City over other U.S. cities as the location to launch his outdoor gear company. Glad I had the opportunity to meet with him and his family during their trip to Washington. https://t.co/9364EBgsZn Utah has had the fastest-growing labor force of any U.S. state since 2010, growing at more than triple the nation‚Äôs pace. https://t.co/BOgvGFHPjC RT @standardex: The commissioners said they made it their mission to impress upon Sen.

This attack is a somber reminder that the threat from ISIS persists, and that the Administration‚Äôs decision to retreat from Syria now is a grave mistake. My heart goes out to the loved ones of the U.S. personnel killed in the terrorist attack in Syria. We will never forget their service and sacrifice to protect the values we hold most dear.

This local-led legislation serves as a model for how public land decisions should be made. https://t.co/W4E13qp0bE Spoke with new North Ogden Mayor Brent Chugg this afternoon. He has some big shoes to fill after the passing of Major Brent Taylor, yet I remain confident he will continue leading the city toward economic growth. https://t.co/cr1l0fmeDb Each day, our men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect ours. Utahns were recently reminded of this with the tragic passing of Officer Joe Shinners. This #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, we recognize all they do to keep our communities safe. Our state has helped to keep Utah's five national parks open during this shutdown. I applaud @Interior for releasing additional funds dedicated toward the basic needs and public safety in our parks. Special thanks to my Utah House colleagues for their efforts to make this happen. Heartbroken with the tragic passing of Officer Joseph Shinners last night in the line duty‚Äîa loving husband and new father. Ann and I extend our deepest condolences to Officer Shinners' family, friends, and fellow @ProvoPolice officers. God bless our men and women in uniform. Rep.
