Pray also that Officer Payne‚Äôs killer will be found and brought to justice. Our hearts our heavy with the news that Shreveport Police Officer Chat√©ri Payne was shot and killed while in uniform last night. She‚Äôd been on the force for only a few weeks. https://t.co/B31rygLLLZ His plan will hurt Californians who depend on Medicaid. MediCal‚Äôs resources are already limited. Without federal money to pay for his plan, legal Californians will have to pay more to support people in our country illegally. I did my medical residency at Los Angeles County Hospital. I saw how many patients came to LA to get free care and in some cases have babies. 

If Governor Newsom does not realize how much of a magnet his plan will be to people in foreign countries, he does not know health care. It is not a basic right to come to the U.S. illegally and force U.S. citizens to pay for your care. And basic rights for American citizens cannot be supported by unsustainable programs. https://t.co/RLX6dFYhwt THANK YOU to our great law enforcement. Never apologize for being you, for doing your job, for protecting our country. This #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay is a good time for every member of Congress to read up and understand the responsibilities of the workers some seek to smear: https://t.co/bZvKsbpBxK In southern California, nearly 40% of ICE officers are Latino. 

Overall, more than 21% of ICE officers are Hispanic. 

Latinos make up more than 50% of border patrol officers. 

Demonizing them as criminals is disgusting. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay Last year ICE literally deported a REAL Nazi from @AOC‚Äôs congressional district. But she can‚Äôt side with the men and women of ICE? https://t.co/C0LfmrBdsJ #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay The truth is that ICE officers put their lives on the line every day to protect the human rights of American citizens.

They take dangerous gang members and deadly drugs off our streets. 

They rescue women and children from ruthless human traffickers. Border patrol officers tried to save the children.

When Steve receives his Congressional Gold Medal, it will be a celebration for those overcoming degenerative diseases, and for the entire state of Louisiana. #CongressionalGoldMedal https://t.co/qhsvQ8MukC Rep. @TulsiGabbard is 100% right: this is religious bigotry, plain and simple.
