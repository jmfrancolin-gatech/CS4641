Hand-delivered my top defense priorities to the Acting Secretary of Defense &amp; military leaders. As a member of the @AppropsDems Subcommittee on Defense, I‚Äôll advocate for the Rock Island Arsenal, the Air National Guard in Peoria &amp; suppliers in Rockford. üëáhttps://t.co/8LUrXsdSSw As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor those who made lasting impacts on our country and in our communities. Black history is American history ‚Äì so check back throughout the month to celebrate some outstanding leaders from right here in our region of Illinois. https://t.co/WbNUH1iehF Thrilled to continue to serve on @HouseAgDems! Agriculture is the number one driver of Illinois‚Äô economy &amp; I‚Äôm looking forward to what we can accomplish this Congress. https://t.co/BJWNW3T5Lc This morning we covered quality of life in the military at my first hearing on the @AppropsDems Military Construction-VA Subcommittee. In this role, I‚Äôll work to ensure our service members, past and present, are taken care of and have access to the resources they need. https://t.co/W4K8mrH4ZB Today was our first Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee hearing. While the White House is in court to strike down patient protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions, @AppropsDems are committed to protecting and improving their health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/w0mM8zPPUn The @ruralhealth association does outstanding work to ensure our rural communities have access to the care they need. Discussed this w/ Genesis Medical Center from Aledo today &amp; it will remain a top priority of mine this Congress! I had a productive conversation today with @ChamberQC and appreciate them stopping by! It was great to discuss economic opportunities in the region and I look forward to our continued work to ensure we have a strong local economy. https://t.co/KoNqmVi1oH The American people sent us here to govern w/ a purpose ‚Äì not to bicker, but to solve problems. I‚Äôll continue working w/ anyone on either side of the aisle to bring down the cost of health care, to invest in our infrastructure &amp; to clean up the corruption in D.C. #ForThePeople The president spoke at length about bridging divides and healing wounds. I hope these weren‚Äôt just lines in a speech ‚Äì but that he will stick to his word to find common ground and avoid another government shutdown in the coming weeks. #SOTU And people with pre-existing conditions cannot ‚Äòchoose greatness‚Äô when Washington Republicans continue working to rip away their critical patient protections. #ProtectOurCare #SOTU However, the families we serve deserve real solutions ‚Äì not just soundbites. Farmers cannot ‚Äòchoose greatness‚Äô when the president‚Äôs #tradewar is eliminating the very markets where they need to sell their goods. #SOTU I‚Äôm also hopeful we can work together to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and families and, as the president proposed, make meaningful investments to fight conditions such as childhood cancer. #SOTU Pleased tonight‚Äôs #SOTU included a commitment to invest in our infrastructure. I‚Äôve worked to bring both parties together on this issue ‚Äì and @HouseDemocrats are ready w/ a trillion-dollar plan to create jobs &amp; rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, hospitals, and locks and dams. RT @voxdotcom: Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL) is bringing a farmer from Trump country to the #SOTU address to send the president a clear message:‚Ä¶ RT @benthomaspayne: I asked Mueller‚Äîwho grows corn, soybeans, and hay, and who raises beef cattle on 750 acres‚Äîhow his opinion of Trump has‚Ä¶ Thanks for chatting #SOTU w/ us. Farmers like Tom are navigating a tough farm economy ‚Äì and this trade war is making it worse. POTUS‚Äô theme tonight is ‚Äúchoosing greatness,‚Äù but farmers can‚Äôt choose greatness if they don‚Äôt have markets to sell their goods. https://t.co/9MFjImIVuT I had a blast introducing my #SOTU guest, Tom, to @SenatorDurbin and the rest of the stellar Illinois Delegation this evening. Thanks for having us ‚Äì we‚Äôre ready for the speech! https://t.co/aeOx7RRo2H Proud to stand with my colleagues as we wear suffragette white today to the #SOTU. With a record number of @HouseDemWomen serving this Congress, we‚Äôre ready to get to work #ForThePeople again! https://t.co/DA2qs2WNAY It was great to meet with the president of @Augustana_IL today to discuss the importance of higher education. I‚Äôll continue working to make sure institutions have the resources they need &amp; to make college more affordable for students in our region. https://t.co/sghMvcKjRE Because it's people like Tom who put food on the plates of families across our nation and world. I'll continue to fight to ensure our family farmers have the resources, tools &amp; certainty they need to succeed. I'm grateful Tom shared his story and is with me here today. [END] That's just not right. Instead, we should be fighting for policies that open markets for our farmers and reward their hard work ‚Äì not hinder it. As a member of @HouseAgDems since I first came to Congress, I've always been a strong voice for our family farmers. Soybean farmers across Illinois have felt the impacts of this trade war on their bottom lines. Tom said it best when he stated, ‚Äúthe reckless trade policies coming from the White House seriously threaten the future of family farms like mine.‚Äù [THREAD] Today is the #SOTU and I‚Äôm so glad to have Tom Mueller as my guest. Tom is a third-generation family farmer &amp; like so many producers across our region, he's concerned about the economic impact of @realDonaldTrump's trade war. https://t.co/aOyGvumWaP .@POTUS‚Äô trade war has been a gut-punch for farmers like Tom. Instead of opening trade markets, he‚Äôs closing them. Instead of building trade allies, he‚Äôs alienating them. We need stability &amp; sensible trade policies ‚Äì but all farmers have gotten from the White House is chaos #SOTU https://t.co/by5hTKCHKe Ms. Barnes‚Äô 2nd grade class has a message for you! Don‚Äôt forget to submit your handmade Valentine‚Äôs Day cards for local veterans by this Friday to one of my Illinois offices: https://t.co/bylYFCz1N9 https://t.co/nMkYVKT0ce Can‚Äôt underscore how vital local news is to our communities. I know this as a former newspaper reporter. We should do everything we can to support their efforts to keep our communities informed and to hold the powerful accountable.  https://t.co/FnKG8vhkLz I always love walking the supermarket aisles to hear what‚Äôs on the minds of hardworking families across Illinois. I look forward to bringing the concerns I heard at Morrison‚Äôs Market in Viola back with me to Washington. https://t.co/9l893OqLQX As Americans, we must come together to reject racism and prejudice. Our leaders should be held to the highest standard in this regard. The photo we saw today was reprehensible and Gov. Northam must resign. 2,150 ‚Äì that‚Äôs how many books we‚Äôve delivered to libraries across our region. Thanks to the Warren County Public Library for letting me stop by today on our @librarycongress Book Delivery Tour! https://t.co/8oB99NGOXk I had a blast making Valentine‚Äôs Day cards today with Ms. Barnes‚Äô 2nd grade class! My sixth annual ‚ÄúValentines for Veterans‚Äù program is off to a great start and I can‚Äôt wait to see all of the cards being made to show local veterans our appreciation. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/yCWfg7ut76 The River Bend Foodbank serves so many across our region and today I paid them a visit to hear the impact the government shutdown had on their services. So grateful for their work to care for families in our community. https://t.co/gAzLcS5hX5 Without Kylie, this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible, and I thank her for her willingness to tell her story. Because of her, nobody will have to go through the same experience she did. 5/5 [END] She was then confronted with costly lease cancellation fees that no family in that situation should face. This legislation fixes this issue and protects Gold Star families by allowing them to terminate residential leases w/o penalty in the wake of a service member‚Äôs death. 4/5 When I called to give Kylie the news, she told me a heartbreaking story. After her husband's passing, Kylie chose to bring her family back to Illinois from Texas, where he was stationed, to be with the rest of their loved ones. 3/5 Kylie‚Äôs husband, Sgt. Douglas J. Riney, made the ultimate sacrifice while defending our freedom in Afghanistan in 2016. The Fairview Post Office has since been dedicated to honor his life and bears his name today ‚Äì after I passed legislation to do so. 2/5 https://t.co/yqFthT3goY [THREAD] Yesterday was a special day. I had the privilege of presenting Kylie Riney with the legislation she inspired ‚Äì the Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act which was recently signed into law. 1/5 https://t.co/Dnrntk8xi4 For my 42nd stop on my @librarycongress Book Delivery Tour, I was at the Farmington Public Library today. With the weather this week, I hope everyone has a good book to pick up ‚Äì stay warm! https://t.co/cgqslh9p4H I‚Äôm proud to help introduce the #PaycheckFairnessAct with @rosadelauro &amp; @HouseDemocrats to help close the wage gap and ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. This is an economic issue for women and families across our region ‚Äì let‚Äôs get it done! https://t.co/NiuhNt0xHM As a proud graduate of the University of Illinois system, I‚Äôm pleased to see them make this announcement. It‚Äôs important that Illinoisans have the opportunity to be educated right here at home and gain the skills needed to go on and join the workforce. https://t.co/jxx9f212jk To our farmers and everyone else braving these tough conditions to get the job done, we are thinking of you and please stay safe! https://t.co/pDxhacDjlb Today was my first day as a member of @AppropsDems!

Ready to make sure the needs of our region are being met, whether that's investments in our infrastructure or rural hospitals. https://t.co/bK2Agka1xj My friend @RepGwenMoore displayed incredible strength today by sharing her story. She‚Äôs not alone ‚Äì we must continue the fight to improve our health care system and protect care for people w/ pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/qgU7SqOY0A Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Thank you for leading the charge, @RepSpeier. Women should have equal opportunities‚Äîno matter the setting. Let‚Äôs get it done! #ERANow https://t.co/BIunYbbQwW As extreme weather conditions sweep through our region and state, please take all of the proper precautions and stay safe! Take a look at this important thread from @GovPritzker üëá https://t.co/2T2asxZtnj Shutting down the government is simply no way to govern and it is my hope that this report makes that clear. Constant threats to shut down the government must end so we can instead focus on policies that grow our economy &amp; help families succeed.  https://t.co/cGs8NWWvGW Folks want us to work together and get something done. Enough partisan fighting. That‚Äôs what I heard at today‚Äôs #SupermarketSaturday in Moline. Ready to focus on the kitchen table issues families care about. https://t.co/TAXB963ulR One of my favorite parts of this job is nominating students to our United States Service Academies. Thanks to our panelists who made the selections. Enjoyed meeting the students and their families today! https://t.co/cgwuvd5DmK Stopped at the Cambridge Public Library to donate books from the @librarycongress ‚Äî our 41st book drop so far! https://t.co/GNM6jQ1Hch My statement on the short-term deal to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/AkrF9yWszd Also stopped by Casey's &amp; heard about their decrease in business because of the shutdown. In a town w/ fewer than 600 people, this can hurt the economy. Pleased by the temporary solution ‚Äì but we need to provide a permanent solution that brings an end to shutdown hostage taking. https://t.co/QUoAFJCptG Was in Thomson today hearing from workers about the shutdown and the financial strain it's causing for their families. These stories are nothing short of heartbreaking. Nobody should have to work without pay. https://t.co/mbqBfa2QpD RT @TelegraphHerald: U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos (@RepCheri) is in Thomson, Ill., this morning to meet with union members who have been working‚Ä¶ Thanks to my @HouseDemocrats colleagues &amp; @usmayors from across the country for standing together to #EndTheShutdown. This is hurting our families and communities. It‚Äôs no way to govern‚Äîthe people deserve better. https://t.co/GZn3jlIsmb About to join @HouseDemocrats and mayors from across the country to discuss how the #TrumpShutdown is impacting our local communities. Time for @senatemajldr to #EndTheShutdown now! Tune in at 3:15 EST: https://t.co/gdkde091wJ https://t.co/djhpe2b22i POTUS &amp; McConnell need to understand the human impact of this shutdown. Families can't afford to go w/o a paycheck‚Äîmuch less two or three. Thanks to @GovPritzker and @ILTreasurer for taking action at the state level to help workers.

Here‚Äôs how you help: https://t.co/ChKR4jQrbt https://t.co/GsCZJIM76I RT @AppropsDems: NEW this morning from President Trumps‚Äôs CHIEF ECONOMIST: If the #TrumpShutdown continues, we could end up with zero econo‚Ä¶ Just spoke w/ @kwqcnews about my efforts to open the govt, #EndTheShutdown and keep communities safe. There‚Äôs a real human cost to this crisis‚Äîhardworking men and women shouldn‚Äôt be missing paychecks while Congress has policy negotiations. https://t.co/SRWF8VDwDd Thanks, Phil, for showing me around the 28th annual Quad Cities farm equipment show yesterday. I had a great time speaking with farmers and vendors from across the region. Despite being faced with a tough agriculture economy, it‚Äôs amazing to see all the great work taking place! https://t.co/xvN1Bdh1oN Had lunch with the Carroll County Farm Bureau yesterday. Despite passing a #FarmBill that provides our farmers with the support they need, the shutdown has made implementation impossible. We must #EndTheShutdown so farmers can get the support during this tough farm economy. https://t.co/TotbPZmjCl This government shutdown is making our communities less safe as TSA &amp; border patrol work w/o pay. I've voted to #EndTheShutdown 9 times now, along with effective measures to secure our borders. Read more about my efforts in the @qctimesüëá https://t.co/knPC74zf52 Today I celebrated the life and legacy of #DrMartinLutherKingJr. with the Rockford community. I hope this celebration of his life reminds us that together we can overcome any challenges, because ‚Äúthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice‚Äù. https://t.co/H6mlqQAscx On #MartinLutherKingJrDay we honor a man who put his faith into action and organized with a message of hope, love &amp; brotherhood. Although we still have a lot of work ahead to realize his dream, he taught us that when we unite under a banner of peace, we can change the world. https://t.co/u7QmCLFeeU Nobody should have to work w/o pay‚Äîbut that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening for TSA workers at Rockford‚Äôs airport due to this shutdown. It‚Äôs wrong and it‚Äôs hurting families. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/P1qh1NgMqt Stopped at a supermarket in Rockford today. Folks are ready to #EndTheShutdown so we can make progress on the kitchen table issues they care about‚Äîbringing down the cost of health care and investing in our infrastructure. https://t.co/clPqUQpwjV RT @FLYPIA: Thank you @RepCheri for your support! https://t.co/dJKLnYl3j8 But because of the shutdown, the USDA program they planned to use to make this expansion has been put on hold. I‚Äôve voted 9 times to #EndTheShutdown ‚Äî time for Mitch McConnell to take up our bills and open the government. Today I visited Hammond-Henry Hospital in Geneseo to see how loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's rural development program will allow them to update their facilities to provide even better care for their patients. https://t.co/moZOfmo9Fo This week, I received a note from Ray in Knoxville, IL that truly shines a light on how the shutdown is hurting brave men and women who‚Äôve put their life on the line for our country. POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr McConnell can take up our bills to #EndTheShutdown now! https://t.co/5tZkQQORWI üëáüèª that‚Äôs absolutely right. This assignment to the Appropriations Committee is a win for our region and a win for Illinois. Ready to get to work! https://t.co/x9O3Tlw9HI I‚Äôll work tirelessly to make sure our region gets its fair share and that communities across our region have a strong voice at the table. https://t.co/XtPwfNFRJU After being appointed to @AppropsDems‚Äô subcommittees on Defense; Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, &amp; Education; &amp;  Mil. Con. and Vets Affairs, I'm better positioned to fight for our regions defense priorities, veterans who‚Äôve served &amp; Illinoisans trying to make ends meet. Since I was elected to office, I promised families across Central &amp; Northwest Illinois that I would be their voice in Washington. Thank you, Chairwoman @NitaLowey! Ready to hit the ground running and go to bat for NW &amp; Central Illinois as a member of the Appropriations Committee. https://t.co/cYO2xdMQtK This shutdown might be a stubborn game of chicken for the White House, but hardworking families across our region know that this is no way to govern ‚Äì we must put the shutdown to an end. #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown And by prolonging this shutdown and rejecting bill after bill to fund our government, the president is making us less safe by not paying our border patrol and TSA agents. This weekend, I spoke with a TSA agent who has no other choice but to dip into her wedding savings to make ends meet. She deserves better than this! People in Illinois are hurting because of the shutdown ‚Äì farmers are facing more uncertainty without the trade assistance they were promised by POTUS and too many Illinoisans aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks in the mail. #TrumpShutdown thread ‚Üí This month, @HouseDemocrats have voted for 7 different funding bills to keep folks safe, end the shutdown &amp; reopen our govt. Despite previous broad bipartisan support, Mitch McConnell &amp; the WH are holding these bills hostage to score political points. This unnecessary shutdown has created hardship for too many families, and we owe it to the American people to do everything we can to mitigate the damage and #EndTheShutdown. More than 7,000 federal workers across IL don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre going to pay rent or put food on the table, let alone make student loan payments. That's why I joined @RepBonamici &amp; called on @BetsyDeVos to help student loan borrowers hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/W7CkFe4Wwt With the passage of this bill, all American flags purchased with taxpayer money will be American-made to ensure that the symbol of our nation is preserved while supporting American jobs and manufacturing. Hopeful the Senate will move on this bill &amp; get it to POTUS' desk. He informed me that the American flag in the corner of the room could have been made overseas, and that he went into the service to fight for the USA, not China. Since that conversation, I have worked across the aisle to require the DOD to purchase American-made flags. Today, the House passed my bipartisan bill that requires all American flags purchased by the federal government to be made in the U.S. &amp; from materials grown or produced in our country. This idea came from a Vietnam veteran in Moline. https://t.co/YDq72X5IaW Edward wrote how hard the shutdown has been on agriculture. Our ag producers already face a tough farm economy ‚Äì and w/ POTUS‚Äô trade war it‚Äôs only gotten worse. This shutdown is causing even MORE uncertainty. Time to end the #TrumpShutdown. Last week, I reached out to the hardworking men and women across #IL17 to hear the impact of the govt. shutdown. Many of you wrote to me sharing the heartbreaking truth about what happens when you put politics over people. https://t.co/uvksUy9mpo Thanks to the @Dispatch_Argus for the kind words ‚Äì we've got to invest in our infrastructure, hospitals and rural communities. Looking forward to fighting for our region as a member of the @AppropsDems!

https://t.co/obiCiDcBbc I went to the Moline airport to hear directly from the TSA Airport Director &amp; Agents that have been working to keep us safe, despite working without pay since the President shutdown the government. It‚Äôs time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/s2n1sYN9RK The lives of far too many across our region have been impacted by the #TrumpShutdown ‚Äì time to open the govt. so the Ag Lab can continue advancing research that drives American agriculture and our economy. This morning I took to the House floor to the recognize ground-breaking research at the Peoria Ag Lab, which has been brought to a grinding halt as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/0pkVFJsykx POTUS promised Mexico would pay for his wall.

Tune in! https://t.co/VJDRaleclW RT @ilcorn: .@RepCheri : ‚ÄúThis appointment...will allow me to better advocate for Illinois families...ensuring the needs of our region are‚Ä¶ With this committee assignment, I plan to help cut through red tape, rein in wasteful spending and make government work for the people of our region again. Read more below: 
https://t.co/fKMIH1vgsF To renew the promise of our region, one of my top priorities will be major investments in our infrastructure. We also need to work harder to meet the needs of rural hospitals that provide critical care while funding ag. priorities like the research at the Peoria Agriculture Lab. Today, I am pleased to announce that I was appointed to serve on the House Appropriations Committee, which will allow me to better advocate for Illinois families‚Äì ensuring the needs of our region are being met and properly funded by the federal government. It looks like I‚Äôll be seeing another friendly face when I‚Äôm in Washington. Congratulations¬† to Rock Island native, Chasson Randle, for signing with the Washington Wizards! üèÄ https://t.co/4jGHCWF5Co Whether it‚Äôs a mother that survived cancer or a child that has asthma ‚Äì they shouldn‚Äôt be discriminated against or priced out of the insurance market.

https://t.co/2TdcLZ8CcA Folks from every corner of the district have reached out to share their deep concerns over partisan attacks on affordable health care, which is why I helped pass legislation today to protect Illinoisans with pre-existing conditions. I will continue putting our families first and work with anyone, and everyone, willing to put this shutdown to an end. https://t.co/mqLNGlKrAq Today I voted to fund the Department of Treasury and the IRS to ensure that Illinoisans receive their tax returns on time, so that small businesses can get the support they need to grow our local economy and to ensure consumer protections can be carried out. Illinois families sent me to Washington to fight for them, and it is my job to ensure that their financial security does not fall victim to President Trump‚Äôs reckless shutdown. On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I want to recognize the brave men and women who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe. A very special thank you to my husband, Gerry, who has served the Quad-Cities for more than 3 decades. You make me so proud. https://t.co/zTggUf6ghT I had such a fun time this afternoon speaking with over 60 college women interested in pursuing careers in public service- including 4 from our very own @Augustana_IL! It is inspiring to meet so many young people looking to make a difference in their communities. https://t.co/c1Ls7FI0MV While the White House has threatened to keep the government shut down for ‚Äòyears,‚Äô I‚Äôll work with anyone to end this reckless shutdown and honor our commitment to keep communities safe. #TrumpShutdown This is just plain wrong. For 18 days, the president has refused to sign bipartisan legislation to open the government and fund effective, fiscally responsible measures to secure our borders. #TrumpShutdown Hardworking families are hurting because of President Trump‚Äôs impulsive decision to shut down the government ‚Äì farmers, airport security officials and workers at the Peoria Agriculture Lab are being used as pawns in a partisan fight they had nothing to do with. #TrumpShutdown Farmers can‚Äôt be used as bargaining chips in the #TrumpShutdown. They already face a tough farm economy &amp; damage from POTUS‚Äô trade war. Time to end the partisan games and open the government. #ForThePeople 
https://t.co/XdHX0G81lq I made some new friends today at Shaheen‚Äôs Village Market in Erie. Thanks to Mayor Marcia Smith for showing me around. It‚Äôs always great to hear what‚Äôs on your mind before I head back to Washington. https://t.co/pr122LaVgo Today I sat down with the Galena Gazette, Mount Carroll Mirror Democrat, Erie Review and Freeport‚Äôs WKEZ to discuss how I‚Äôll continue working across the aisle in the new Congress to deliver results and overcome the current gridlock in Washington. https://t.co/gP2mZaZ3Ym From making sure small towns get fair relief from FEMA to passing a Farm Bill that ensures rural communities have the resources they need to combat the opioid epidemic, I am proud of the progress we have made across our region to better the lives of Illinoisans. Illinoisans sent me to Congress to fight for them, not to play partisan games. My top priorities remain the issues I hear about from folks in the supermarket ‚Äì making health care affordable, investing in our infrastructure &amp; stomping out corruption in DC. https://t.co/KqGCE4F114 From being named the Army Center of Excellence for Advanced and Additive Manufacturing to supporting our troops, it‚Äôs been an amazing year for the @Arsenal_Island! I had a great time celebrating its success and I‚Äôll fight to make sure it remains strong for generations to come. https://t.co/lvX2hSCcQs It‚Äôs time to make sure our government is working #ForThePeople. It‚Äôs my job to ensure your concerns are heard in Washington, which is why our first votes in the new House majority were to end the shutdown and for a new set of rules that will make the House advance common sense bipartisan solutions and govern more effectively. While walking the aisles of Aldi in Moline today, I continued to hear frustrations over why Congress can't seem to get anything done. https://t.co/Vzpt6H6yAk With 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working w/o pay -- incl. at our airports &amp; the Peoria Ag Lab -- the Trump Admin. is preparing to dole out raises for senior officials that are 1/4 of what the average person makes in our region. This is absurd!
https://t.co/7sIc5BVRDl So proud to be serving w/ @janschakowsky &amp; @RepRobinKelly again ‚Äì and we‚Äôre excited to welcome @RepUnderwood to the House! With @SenDuckworth in the Senate, Illinois women have strong leaders fighting for them in Congress. #GirlPower https://t.co/swdqx9voOI Today I stood with all the House Democratic women of the 116th Congress to celebrate the historic progress we‚Äôve made so far. But let‚Äôs keep building ‚Äì we can‚Äôt be satisfied until Congress truly reflects the people we serve. #GirlPower https://t.co/YWnoUcM0Aj Finally, it‚Äôs time for Congress to live within its means ‚Äì just like Illinoisans do every single day. Any new spending must be offset with cuts or new revenue. Time to govern responsibly and #ForThePeople. No more taxpayer funded settlements for Members of Congress who‚Äôve sexually harassed or discriminated against staff. Those days are over. #ForThePeople We‚Äôre also going to deliver results for American families by ensuring commonsense bipartisan bills w/ 290 cosponsors have the chance to be voted on while looking at how we can modernize Congress to work more effectively. .@HouseDemocrats 1st order of business was making the House more effective &amp; accountable. This package ensures we govern with integrity by making Members of Congress &amp; staff attend ethics training &amp; preventing them from serving on corporate boards. #ForThePeople I‚Äôm proud to announce a $1.3 million grant that will allow Eagle View to continue providing quality care across our region. I‚Äôll continue working with our outstanding community health centers to ensure Illinois families have access to the care they need. https://t.co/Ejzhg4Gho0 This is false-We already have fencing &amp; barriers along parts of the border. I support common sense and effective means to secure the border. We must negotiate to end the #TrumpShutdown but not by giving the President a costly &amp; ineffective taxpayer-funded wall for political cover https://t.co/q8kkFuINHp Up next on @NewDay CNN ‚Äî tune in! As experts have long said, we ought to invest in 21st century solutions to secure the border ‚Äì not an outdated, ineffective and fiscally irresponsible wall as the President has proposed. As the wife of a Sheriff, I know we must keep our communities safe ‚Äì I‚Äôve always supported both comprehensive immigration reform &amp; effective strategies to secure our borders. But w/ the #TrumpShutdown, border patrol agents aren‚Äôt being paid for their work ‚Äì that‚Äôs just wrong! Two weeks ago, there was a bipartisan consensus to fund the government that *every single Senator* agreed to ‚Äì nearly identical to the legislation we passed today ‚Äì and I hope they will work with us in good faith to end the shutdown. The President cannot tweet his way out of the shutdown ‚Äì he needs to work w/ both parties to find solutions. And while he continues to sow chaos at the expense of ordinary Americans, we are committed to governing responsibly #ForThePeople &amp; leading our country out of this mess. FBI agents, border patrol officers and airport security officials shouldn‚Äôt have to go to work and wonder if they can make next month‚Äôs rent. They deserve better! Right now, there are 800K hardworking men &amp; women either furloughed or working w/o pay because POTUS &amp; Washington Republicans chose to play political games rather than fulfill their basic responsibility to keep the govt. functioning. Families are hurting because of this. BREAKING: The new House Democratic majority just took immediate action to end the #TrumpShutdown and bring this needless stunt to an end. Today was a special day as Democrats were sworn in and took the majority. What makes it even better is getting to serve alongside so many great friends. Ready to get to work #ForThePeople! https://t.co/zbQHb3Bhse Today I was sworn in to my 4th term serving Illinois‚Äô 17th District.

Serving the people of Illinois‚Äô 17th District is my highest honor and I was so happy to share this special day with family and good friends. https://t.co/WWml47Vnjy Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/W4rP3BKvWY Heading on CNN w/ @AnaCabrera to discuss the #TrumpShutdown and how @HouseDemocrats will govern effectively #ForThePeople. Tune in! Such exciting news! Our community has such a special, unique history with the NFL. It‚Äôs going to be a big day for the Quad Cities and fellow football fans ‚Äì share the news with your friends! üëáüèªüèà https://t.co/9rHGXMMkTF It‚Äôs been touching to see the outpouring of kindness across our region this holiday season. Kids like Nathan make me especially proud to serve Illinois‚Äô 17th Congressional District ‚Äì we can all learn from his selflessness. 
https://t.co/ngM1ZO8NIk REMINDER: The hardworking men and women at the Peoria Ag Lab are just some of the federal workers who are furloughed or working w/o pay due to the #TrumpShutdown. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll vote for legislation to open the government, fund the Ag Lab and end this manufactured crisis. Decades after discovering how to mass produce penicillin, the Ag Lab continues to help Americans all across the country. That's why I fought tirelessly against Pres. Trump's previous budgets, which recklessly proposed closing the lab in its entirety.
https://t.co/J0rrV4uVs5 Tomorrow, @HouseDemocrats will vote to end the #TrumpShutdown and open the government. While the White House &amp; Mitch McConnell continue to sow chaos, we will work #ForThePeople and govern with integrity, transparency and accountability. Happy New Year, everyone! I feel privileged to have served you this past year and look forward to another year of fighting for the hardworking people across our region. https://t.co/tMDCjGqNLU From delivering my 2,000th donated book to the Williamsfield Library to honoring the life of Sgt. Riney with the Fairview community, my proudest moments of #2018 have come from serving you. As I share some of my proudest moments, I would also love to hear some of yours! https://t.co/Hzq4HVw1g3 God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason ‚Äî we should use them proportionally. Read more in the @rrstar about how I‚Äôve been able to get results by listening to hardworking families in our region and taking their concerns to Congress. https://t.co/5aFxlo5cST I am sad to see that our family farmers, already caught in @realDonaldTrump's trade war, could become the latest casualty of the #TrumpShutdown. It is time to end this shutdown and put the needs of working families above partisan politics. #ForThePeople 
https://t.co/a3pAoejWlU The holiday season truly is about giving, and it‚Äôs an honor to serve so many amazing families that have never lost sight of that. https://t.co/EwjYAKVFuM I would like to thank &amp; wish a very #MerryChrismas to all the doctors, nurses, policemen, firefighters, service-members, care givers and everyone else working through the holidays to keep our families safe. May you all have a joyous &amp; blessed holidays season. From my family to yours, have a Merry Christmas &amp; a happy holiday season! This is a wonderful time of year that allows us to reflect on what‚Äôs most important ‚Äì family, community and goodwill to our friends &amp; neighbors. I wish you and your loved ones a joyful ending to your year. https://t.co/Mlp4Q9qnLr To help veterans, seniors and hardworking families navigate this shutdown, our Congressional office is maintaining operations during this shutdown. We will also continue to inform the public about the shutdown and its impact at https://t.co/byGSMRbvEq. Americans deserve better than relentless dysfunction &amp; politicians who are more interested in scoring political points than executing the basic functions of government. I'll continue working to bring both sides together to bring the shutdown to an end as quickly as possible. Let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äì this government shutdown, driven by House Republicans and the president, was completely avoidable. Washington‚Äôs constant culture of failure and ineffectiveness was on full display this week ‚Äì and families across the Heartland are understandably frustrated. I was excited to hear that the International Women‚Äôs Baseball Center is planning memorialize Penny Marshall, the late director who put our amazing Rockford Peaches on the map! Her work cemented the legacy of these trailblazing women and I can't think of a better way to honor her. https://t.co/JgH9FOeUBH The families of our fallen heroes have already sacrificed so much &amp; we should ensure grieving spouses receive the support they need. That‚Äôs why I'm proud my bill, extending protections to Gold Star Families, is heading to POTUS‚Äô desk. https://t.co/xVnjsLPosb https://t.co/6Jdxf84VmY Extremely disappointed @HouseGOP &amp; POTUS refused to support the bipartisan funding bill. Rather than working w/ both parties to keep the govt. open, they're playing partisan politics w/ the well-being of Illinois families &amp; pushing us closer to a shutdown. This was avoidable. RT @RepMarciaFudge: Today, the House passed the bipartisan Water Infrastructure Improvement Act. Thank you @repbobgibbs @gracenapolitano @b‚Ä¶ RT @FarmWeekNow: @RepCheri serves as #farmbill conferee, says outcome good for rural development. Learn why: https://t.co/GtOFMaGIWD https:‚Ä¶ Yesterday the House passed my bipartisan Water Infrastructure Improvement Act. This commonsense legislation would allow our communities to modernize their water infrastructure while creating food-paying green jobs. https://t.co/Z6wPBj7mjr I‚Äôm proud to announce $6 million in federal funding to help ensure we are raising our children in a safe &amp; lead-free home. I encourage all concerned families to click the link the below and see how you can apply. https://t.co/nHgbZGLw7G I met so many kind people getting ready for the holidays at the Jewel Osco in Silvis this weekend. It‚Äôs conversations like these that remind me why we must never stop fighting for a government that works #ForThePeople. https://t.co/nf5dppWNWs RT @HouseDemocrats: Tomorrow is the last day to sign up for a new healthcare plan. #GetCovered for the new year at https://t.co/KeLeEkeGDU!‚Ä¶ RT @RepAnnieKuster: Wonderful to connect with my fellow 2012 classmates to celebrate the holidays and our many members moving into leadersh‚Ä¶ The #FarmBill provides our farmers with the support they need to put food on our plates. Although this process was far from perfect, I'm glad we were able to pass a bipartisan Farm Bill that provides our growers and producers with some certainty during these turbulent times. On this wear red Wednesday my colleagues and I joined @RepWilson as we continue the fight to #BringBackOurGirls who were taken by Boko Haram. We must never forget them and ensure they are safely reunited with their families. https://t.co/X8yzm1Rmmn RT @marthamaccallum: Great interview today w/Dems in new leadership roles. They wear red on Wednesday to #BringBackOurGirls ‚Å¶@KatherineClar‚Ä¶ RT @RepMarciaFudge: https://t.co/g8XSBMccOO I am proud to have my bill included in the 2018 #FarmBill that helps rural communities combat the opioid epidemic by providing them the tools and resources they need to fight back. https://t.co/dpoH5el0ji Yesterday, I introduced legislation to honor the women who served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during WWII. It is only right that we recognize their actions and sacrifices, both at home and abroad, and grant them honorary veteran status. Our country is grateful for your service! https://t.co/HtNEY9tn5n I would like to thank @TIME for recognizing journalists that have sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of the truth. As a former journalist, I understand the vital role that the #FreePress plays in holding governments accountable and I am thankful for their work every day. https://t.co/4c0RUbkcgP I‚Äôm proud we were able to come together and deliver a bipartisan #FarmBill18 Conference Committee Report that supports the hardworking Illinois farmers that put food on our plates every day. Next stop, the House floor! https://t.co/9TbdF35Hwa RT @ASLRRA: Congresswoman Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) toured ASLRRA member Koppers‚Äô railroad tie facility in Galesburg, Ill. on Dec. 3. Bustos is‚Ä¶ RT @HouseDemocrats: Compare all the health care options available for 2019 at https://t.co/9L5xb5NOcS.

We are forever indebted. #PearlHarborRemembranceDay https://t.co/FHDMu8j2GE Thank you to one of our many outstanding interns, Miro, for all of your hard work this semester. It was great to hear about your experiences on Capitol Hill and I appreciate all you‚Äôve done to serve the people of Illinois' 17th district! https://t.co/2Te8VJOGZO I am proud to announce that the USDA is investing more than $3 million in the water infrastructure of Elizabeth and Woodhull. These job-creating Rural Development dollars will go a long way in giving our towns an opportunity to grow and succeed.
https://t.co/soowCE2wo5 It had a great meeting with leaders from Pacific Ethanol today. I had a blast on my "Cheri on Shift" at your Pekin location this summer. Thanks for stopping by my DC office to continue the conversation about the importance of renewable fuels in our region! https://t.co/5itEGAnDsY Thanks for having me! https://t.co/QqSicMWruI Happy 32nd wedding anniversary to my amazing husband, Gerry. It feels like it was just yesterday that we met at the Cow Bell in East Moline, how time flies! https://t.co/bDwhsCPw3a Thank you to all of our first responders, local officials &amp; volunteers who have already come out to help. Lewistown is an amazing community that has gotten through adversity before, &amp; I know we‚Äôll come together once again to rebuild. https://t.co/OXDm2nO3MP I will never forget the devastation I saw in Canton following the explosion that took the life of Arturo Silva Jr. &amp; injured 12 others. I hope the conclusion of this investigation will bring closure to the community and help them move past this tragedy. https://t.co/g7w0RrdWep Happy 200th Birthday, Illinois! As we celebrate the rich history of our state today, I am reminded how lucky I am to call it home. Illinois has played a pivotal role in our nation‚Äôs history and I look forward to all the great things ahead. #Illinois200 https://t.co/en7Ffy16hX Today, I delivered my 2,000th book to Williamsfield Public Library on my 40th Library of Congress Book drop! I‚Äôve had a blast delivering so many books and hope they help kids develop a lifelong passion for reading. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/M1ug5YcgYs Happy Hanukkah! Wishing you and your family a wonderful 8 days. üïé Open enrollment closes in less than 2 weeks! Go to https://t.co/8HydY2mLQ4 to get #GetCovered today! https://t.co/pumcnud9x8 I‚Äôm deeply saddened to learn of the passing of President George H.W. Bush. He was a war hero who went on to serve our nation with character, dignity and a belief that America is at its best when we address our challenges with decency. RIP President Bush and prayers to his family. The House passed my bipartisan bill that requires all American flags purchased by the federal government to be made in the U.S. By purchasing flags made on American soil, we can ensure the symbol of our nation is preserved while supporting American jobs and manufacturing. https://t.co/zG6saWMYFa I‚Äôm just about to be on @hardball with @HardballChris to talk about @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs ridiculous day and how @HouseDemocrats are going to bring accountability back to Washington. This afternoon I got to welcome the newest member of the House, Congresswoman-Elect Susan Wild, and her adorable dog Zoey. I can‚Äôt wait to start working with you! https://t.co/uEeUczXDFo RT @FedAmerHospital: 60 million Americans rely on services provided by rural hospitals. Last week a bipartisan group of lawmakers stood up‚Ä¶ A #GivingTuesday shout out to Avery and Kennedy of Prophetstown, who have gone out of their way to brighten up the holidays for others! I never cease to be amazed by the kind and remarkable individuals I get to serve. https://t.co/og3UTfSAoq Open enrollment at https://t.co/8HydY2mLQ4 is underway! You have until December 15th to #GetCovered. Help us spread the word! https://t.co/dGOQUsBoxp My heart breaks for the 14,700 hardworking @GM employees that woke up to find their jobs shipped overseas as a result of the @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs reckless trade war. It‚Äôs time we have responsible government fighting #ForThePeople. https://t.co/VFNg96sOrV Giving tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy with no way to pay for it ushered in a new era of trillion-dollar deficits. When @HouseDemocrats take back the gavels in January, we're going to fight #ForThePeople by lowering health care costs, raising wages and dealing with this debt! I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with friends, family and football- Go @ChicagoBears! https://t.co/nzD5Z4F6C1 I had a great time sitting down with Jim Niedelman for @Local4NewsWHBF‚Äòs 4 the Record. We discussed many important issues facing our region including the need to pass a strong Farm Bill. I hope you can tune in to watch! https://t.co/OffWLPZBdl Today I served up some turkey at    Rock Island Academy.
