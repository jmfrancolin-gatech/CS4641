Godspeed, Dean of the People’s House. To me, John Dingell represents the House itself, in all of its dignity and downhomeness. He mastered and enjoyed it all: the policy, the process, the relationships. As a two-time cancer survivor and father of sons with Crohn’s disease, I know well the financial threats to workers with pre-existing conditions. I’d like to thank Chad Riedy, a man living with #cysticfibrosis, for his testimony before the @EdLaborCmte. https://t.co/FZjsXuvD05 My primary concern is &amp; will continue to be that workers impacted by this transition, along with frontline &amp; vulnerable communities, are seated at the center of the table as we discuss the resources &amp; policies to effectuate change we need to save our species &amp; our planet. (8/8) Today we embark on a journey that will reveal once again the unbounded creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship of the American people as we develop the technology, grow millions of new jobs and meet this challenge. (7/8) Just as we responded to the Great Depression with the New Deal; just as we responded to Pearl Harbor by mobilizing our entire country and so many allies; and just as President Kennedy said we would go to the moon when we didn’t know how, but landed there a decade later... (6/8) However, in crisis I see overwhelming opportunity. (5/8) Unfortunately, we have waited until the 11th hour to take this seriously enough to have any hope of keeping global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius, which itself will inflict massive and problematic changes on the planet. (4/8) The future of humanity, the future of a multitude of other species and the future of our wondrous variety of ecosystems depend on bold and unprecedented action, which we’re starting right now. (3/8) For over 30 years, the scientific community has understood the need to fundamentally transition everything about how we live, work, play and move about our planet in order to protect life on Earth as we know it. (2/8) THREAD: There’s no way we can move fast enough or comprehensively enough to address climate change unless we unite all progressive forces. That’s why I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Green New Deal resolution.

@JohnDingell @RepDebDingell Excited to join @RepColinAllred &amp; @RepSpanberger for our first @HouseForeign hearing on U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. This discussion is long overdue. We must change course to save innocent lives in Yemen &amp; hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its human rights record. https://t.co/9DgbuqKQ5N Listen live now! 👇 https://t.co/OLAhRCfu2u SOTU = empty calories. I feel like I just ate a bunch of potato chips, Twinkies and pop tarts. @POTUS trotted out one tear-jerking &amp; patriotic story after another. They were touching, but where was the *policy* to help our kids, protect seniors or advance freedom &amp; justice? It’s all symbolism. Empty calories. Not to mention totally divorced from his track record. I can’t believe I’m here listening to the POTUS champion a new nuclear arms race, bragging that we will outspend all others. That’s a prescription for disaster. I hope I can contribute toward a more peaceful direction from the @HouseForeign Asia and Nonproliferation subcommittee. It feels sickening to sit here — as a two-time cancer survivor — and listen to a man who has repeatedly proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health budget use the story of a child cancer survivor for applause. What has he done to speed cancer research? Nothing! On Capitol Hill before the State of the Union with two superstars I admire so much: @AOC and Ghana Goodwin-Dye, the president of @UAW Local 909 and my guest for the #SOTU https://t.co/w27kTFsDWU The President’s agenda has been failing middle class families for two years. Tonight, he’ll try to pretend otherwise. We need an economy that works for everybody, not just the people who are already at the top. The President just doesn’t seem to understand that. #SOTU I love everything about this, @gretchenwhitmer: the name, the leader, the consolidating and lifting up of clean water and clean energy in one smart package—at once a hyper-urgent moral imperative and a tremendous economic opportunity. Let the EGLE take flight! https://t.co/rMvS7fYDOB Tomorrow, I will be joined at the SOTU by @UAW Local 909 President Ghana Goodwin-Dye. There's nothing more important to me as a person, as a Michigander and as a member of Congress than protecting the rights and dignity of hardworking people like Ghana and her fellow members. https://t.co/rW4wMlo92f RT @UAW: .@RepAndyLevin and @RepTimRyan have invited UAW Presidents Ghana Goodwin-Dye of Warren Local 909 and Dave Green of Youngstown Loca… The U.S. should be pushing hard for a multilateral effort to keep Russia moving in the right direction on arms control.

Let’s get this done – fast. https://t.co/pLSbW6v641 Fellow Michiganders in #MI09, PLEASE remember to turn down your thermostat if you can stand it so that everyone can have heat.

I hope I *never* stop loving 🛷.  But I decided to hightail it back to DC last night to beat the storm. This new congressman is not about to risk missing a vote on behalf of the citizens of #MI09! The CBO estimates that President Trump’s shutdown did $11 billion in damage to the economy. It’s wildly irresponsible of the President to threaten another shutdown after learning its impact on working families and the broader economy. https://t.co/vhaxtyA64B Even though this @BerkleySchools Bear had to throw a little shade on the surplus @Seaholmhs pride, the focus on public education today was tremendous, and @RepHaleyStevens and I will be your champions on the @EdLaborCmte.

https://t.co/bqKb0lGRIc It’s Day 34 of the senseless Trump-McConnell shutdown, and also the eve of another payless payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. As of today, the House has passed 10 bills to reopen the government. It’s time to end this. #ForThePeople https://t.co/LPbpnMYsPu This is not okay. The President and @senategop are putting Americans in danger while @housedemocrats have passed 10 bills to reopen the government. What will it take to end this tantrum? https://t.co/irdoqGHr5z I’m so looking forward to seeing you at my first Macomb coffee hour.

Today I voted for the 10th time to reopen the government. #Day33 https://t.co/Mq74Ttkt4d We must redouble our efforts to support equality for transgender Americans so they can serve, work and live with dignity. SCOTUS did NOT decide the merits of the case, so the cruel ban will go into effect while cases wend their way through lower courts. https://t.co/UaemGgo7dP I couldn’t imagine a more inspiring start to my congressional career than today’s coffee hour.

It seems the president’s belittling of Native Americans and others has had an impact on his followers, to the detriment of our kids and us all. https://t.co/BTBkTHyC0o Imagine negotiating with someone who steals your car and your TV set and then offers to return them to you as a “compromise." It was Donald Trump who ended DACA and TPS. Now he offers to “fix” those programs in exchange for getting his border wall. https://t.co/5QnXl2d7yn The President must re-open the government so we can move ahead with important policy discussions, including border security, and restore certainty to the hundreds of thousands of working families that are hurting because of his shutdown. The President can make bad-faith appeals on national television as many times as he likes, but Americans know the truth that he willingly and proudly shut down the government after not getting what he wanted. I saw so many friends from #MI09 and beyond as we all recommitted to the struggle to expand women’s rights and power. #WomensWave #WomensMarch2019 After another week of fighting to reopen the government, I got such an instant energy boost walking into the electric Women’s March Detroit. It was both an honor and great fun to introduce @SenStabenow, an outstanding leader among the most diverse Congress in history. https://t.co/nFTf2ES5di This is deeply troubling. If a president instructs his attorney to lie to Congress, he is committing a very serious crime—a crime that cuts to the quick of the very integrity of our democracy. That is not something Congress could let stand, regardless of party and politics. https://t.co/C3rRrxFGLX RT @HouseForeign: We are excited to welcome these 12 new Members to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs: @RepColinAllred @RepJimCosta @R… I’m so looking forward to seeing you at my first coffee hour.

(6/6) My primary focus as the congressman from Michigan’s 9th District is to help rebuild the middle class by making every policy decision about raising the standard of living for working people. (5/6) The skyrocketing cost of higher education is making it harder for parents to send their kids to college, and college graduates who have paid their way face immense burdens of debt. (4/6) Our students in K-12 schools are not getting the resources they need to be successful, and policymakers are not listening to the educators and specialists who work hands-on with students every day. (3/6) Despite a lifetime of hard work, most older Americans don’t have the savings to retire with dignity. Our economy isn’t working for all Americans as real wages are stagnant. (2/6) I came to Congress to tackle the big problems that are keeping working families from prospering. (1/6) This is great news, but the fight is not over. Proud to be a new member of the @ProChoiceCaucus &amp; ready to take on the Trump administration’s dangerous anti-women agenda. https://t.co/URKkS96HYr On Friday, I met with federal workers on their #paylesspayday caused by  the senseless #TrumpShutdown. I’ll be headed to the House Floor shortly to share what I learned about how it’s imperiling working families. You won’t find me driving a Volkswagen, Toyota or Kia until their workers have collective bargaining. I came to Congress to fight for workers’ rights and living standards, and I’m not going to be shy about it. I was also quite frank with leaders of German, Japanese and Korean companies about the need to allow their workers to unionize as freely here as they do at home. They were polite, but clearly surprised. I loved the new @Chrysler, @Ford and @GM products we saw at the @NAIASDetroit.

Watch live at https://t.co/Az69G0oFIT. 45 wants you to believe that our country is in crisis. It is, but not for the reason he claims. 

It’s in crisis because more than 5,000 federal workers in Michigan are furloughed or working without pay, their paychecks becoming political bargaining chips. https://t.co/NenqdredXm The President's lies tonight didn't change the fact that American families are hurting because of the #TrumpShutdown. Enough. 5. Trump's wall ≠ border security. 4. The crime rate among immigrants is significantly lower than among native-born Americans. 3. Kids are being brought into this country by their familes, not by coyotes. 2. A border wall won't stop drugs. 1. Mexico won't pay for his wall, directly or indirectly. Some simple but essential fact-checking following President Trump's speech: What an honor to join Mother of the Movement Rep. @lucymcbath_ and other freshman to meet @AMarch4OurLives organizers @davidhogg111 @JaclynCorin @charlie_mirsky and @mattlpost. Our youth finally have a Congress that is ready to listen and to fight for common sense gun laws. https://t.co/zBFMlzVdmW On the 18th day of the #TrumpShutdown,  I’m thinking of the 1 in 2 babies born in Michigan who receive vital nutritional assistance, a program which could lose funding if the  shutdown continues.
