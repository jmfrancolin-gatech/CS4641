I‚Äôll work to end voter suppression &amp; create real voting rights reform so everyone can cast a ballot and not be stuck in long lines. https://t.co/su6wb50wzo Instead of taking any responsibility, the White House and DHS casts blame on the terrified parents who are  solely trying to protect their children. https://t.co/JM4enIW4KS Here's how:
1. Trump has cut legal asylum programs from Central America to the US, limiting the ability of migrant families to come through legal channels.

2. For families that cross through legal ports of entry, this Administration is failing to provide adequate care &amp; counsel. Spoke to @AnaCabrera about Trump's inability to handle an already chaotic situation at our border. In fact, he is making it worse. https://t.co/qUZDOQpEqC Make sure to tune in tonight @ 7pm CT / 8pm ET as I discuss this on @CNN w/ @AnaCabrera. I‚Äôll also share an update on the letter from myself, @JoaquinCastrotx, @MartinHeinrich, @tomudall, @RepLujanGrisham, &amp; @repbenraylujan sent to DHS Sec. Nielsen to demand a full investigation. The question we must ask ourselves: Are we a country that turns away victims of violence, drug trafficking &amp; rape? Or are we a country that ensures families are kept together, treated with dignity, and at their most vulnerable, provided safe refuge. Many immigrants are coming through legal ports of entry and are getting denied. This Administration continues to pour gas on a chaotic situation, including teargassing migrants trying to come through legal ports of entry. But, they continue to cast blame on anyone but themselves. The White House and DHS blame the death of a 7-year-old girl on immigrants seeking asylum. They claim if they came through ports of entry legally, we wouldn‚Äôt be faced with an escalating border crisis. Let‚Äôs factcheck this.
https://t.co/JbRUSb0p5Q Reminder: If you leave your information tonight with an ACA enrollment agent, you are still qualified for enrollment after the deadline. An enrollment specialist will reach back out to help you get a plan setup. We will appeal yesterday‚Äôs ruling. We will fight for every person‚Äôs right to care and to protect people with preexisting conditions. Tonight at midnight is the deadline to sign up. If you‚Äôre in North Texas, there are resources to help you pick your plan. https://t.co/PeaP6uZ5pj RT @NancyPelosi: Tonight‚Äôs absurd ruling exposes the monstrous endgame of the GOP‚Äôs all-out assault on people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp;‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt let this ruling discourage you from selecting a healthcare plan. Please still sign up for healthcare coverage for 2019 at https://t.co/qf21eHuyDY The ACA is still intact. Today‚Äôs ruling could jeopardize the healthcare of millions of Americans who rely on the ACA. While this is a setback, the ACA has endured 70 repeal attempts and we will continue to fight to protect every family who deserves access to affordable care. 1/2 The American public deserves answers. We're tired of the lack of transparency &amp; accountability in the Trump Administration. That‚Äôs why we are demanding a full investigation to prevent this tragedy from happening to anyone else‚Äôs family. https://t.co/8AEBVXQzgM Don‚Äôt put it off any longer. Sign up for affordable health coverage at https://t.co/xpUeI4yDpq before December 15. https://t.co/RgZ99h8uvt The innocent children and teachers we lost six years ago at #SandyHook still haunt this country. No more families can endure the pain of losing loved ones to senseless and preventable acts of gun violence when we have the ability to take action, and we must! https://t.co/sRJuFGKeLl A 7-year-old girl has died on this President‚Äôs watch.

The callous and inhumane treatment of migrant children &amp; families by this Administration has led us to the brink.

We must prevent future tragedies, but w/ 15,000 kids still at risk in detention centers, what‚Äôs @POTUS‚Äôs plan? https://t.co/PGdssXPP9y It‚Äôs about time this bill passed. Now it‚Äôs imperative it gets signed into law and Congress sets a good example of the kind of safe work environment women deserve in workplaces across the country. 
https://t.co/w2GVIgRdYm Reby Cary was a Black icon in Fort Worth. He was the first African American appointed to the @FortWorthISD school board and the first Black instructor at Tarrant County Junior College. He was a trailblazer and ensured Black pioneers in North Texas will never be forgotten. #RIP https://t.co/kqfTfb7Iwb Signing up for health coverage is cheaper than you might think. Most people qualify for financial assistance, and 8 in 10 people can get covered for less than $75 per month. You have three days to #GetCovered for 2019. https://t.co/ffwtJXck8Q Today, I‚Äôm proud to honor the life of a black icon in Fort Worth, Reby Cary.

https://t.co/Sw1fAp47Pw Excited to work with incoming CBC Chairwoman @RepKarenBass to reform and protect voting rights. In our democracy, it‚Äôs time for every American, especially our youth, to be active participants and provide opportunities to include them in our process. We‚Äôre ready to walk the talk. https://t.co/0awnAAELDx The effects of air pollution are especially harmful to the most vulnerable among us: children, seniors, and low-income communities. Yet, Republicans sit back as Trump repeals critical protections at the cost of American lives. #ParisAgreement https://t.co/NFekLhaKwi We are saying goodbye to Longworth and moving to a new office. Come visit us at our new DC location at Rayburn Office House Building 2348. https://t.co/qX7utnS8Ba .@realDonaldTrump:"Proud to shutdown the government!" How utterly stupid and unpresidential. https://t.co/ilzdywNrrm Thank you to the @RedCross for hosting a thoughtful expression of gratitude for our service members at their #HolidayforHeroes card signing event. I shared how grateful my family and I are, especially over the holiday season, for our men and women overseas. https://t.co/CQVoj3fSL0 RT @RepSarbanes: Some meaningful and well-deserved recognition for @capgaznews and our entire Annapolis community. https://t.co/ozRTECAYzR No one should have to choose between accessing food &amp; medication and advancing their immigration status. I‚Äôm proud to stand w/ my colleagues against Trump's #PublicCharge &amp; will join over 100k comments submitted against the detrimental effect of this policy on our communities. Today Medicaid patients who depend on @PPFA for quality preventive and reproductive healthcare services can breathe a sigh of relief. It won't be the last @GOP attack on women's healthcare but we are ready to fight back. 
https://t.co/Invk3ixo8T Trump's ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù regulation is an attack on millions of families, threatening to drive up poverty, health care disparities &amp; unmet housing needs. We need to fight to #ProtectFamilies. Make your voice heard and submit a comment TODAY! https://t.co/Xuye0qoNfJ RT @BarackObama: No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time.

They brought Texas character and wit and our entire office is extremely thankful for their hard work this semester. We will miss you and hope to see you back in DC soon! https://t.co/ZqKvc8qPb1 Times of crisis show our nation‚Äôs strength and resolve. Today, we remember the 2,400 Americans who lost their lives at #PearlHarbor. They fought to defend and uphold our values. Let's honor their memories by continuing to highlight their bravery and courage today. https://t.co/F31sNKlRJf The 13th amendment abolished the institution of slavery, guaranteeing freedom for millions of Americans. Today it‚Äôs a reminder of the progress we can accomplish when we work together, unified against the evils of racism and bigotry. https://t.co/RcD3kJZdZG Congrats to Lauren, Elihu, Memphis and Juliann, students at Sunset HS in Dallas for winning Texas‚Äô 33rd Congressional App Challenge with their Scape gaming app. Can‚Äôt wait to see you next spring at the #HouseOfCode winner‚Äôs reception in the U.S. Capitol! https://t.co/Z0fzQne3dX Today we say our final goodbye to our fellow Texan, George H.W.

I‚Äôm proud of your hard work and leadership on and off the field. Go Rams! 
https://t.co/L4FKVj2QC9 If we want to see growth in the business sector, we need to remove the financial barriers minority, women and veteran-owned small businesses face.

Wishing all those celebrating a peaceful and joyous holiday filled with family and friends. https://t.co/QTYsk1A1AE Real voting rights reforms are long overdue.
