1. Reopen the government 
2. Keep these unjust raises from happening and 
3. Instate a 1.9% COLA to all other federal employees (who've more than earned it)

#mepolitics The Vice President &amp; political appointees stand to get generous raises as 800k fed employees suffer w/o a paycheck (for how long, only President Trump can say). Simply Outrageous! #mepolitics

https://t.co/TlDmJMJ227 The funding bills are the product of months of bipartisan work on the Appropriations Committee. They will provide much-needed certainty for federal employees and restore their critical functions, while making room for a meaningful debate on homeland security. #mepolitics https://t.co/HU5IrcvDc6 It‚Äôs official! üá∫üá∏ #mepolitics https://t.co/3b8LA3eU6d Proud to be among the 102 women sworn into the #116thCongress alongside @AyannaPressley.

The swearing in of @JanetMillsforME as Governor is the start of good things to come for the people of #Maine. With decades of her career devoted to public service, Janet is ready to immediately begin restoring the functions &amp; responsibilities of state government. #mepolitics Grateful to TSA agents who are working w/o pay b/c of #TrumpShutdown. One agent specifically told me single mothers on staff are struggling to make ends meet. Unacceptable! Tomorrow Democrats will take back the House &amp; respect fed workers by funding their jobs, reopening gov‚Äôt.

Americans are counting on us to provide stability and reassurance in the face of the Trump administration‚Äôs chaos. 5/5 #mepolitics We‚Äôve seen two of his cabinet secretaries abruptly resign; he‚Äôs changed our foreign policy course in Syria via tweet; he‚Äôs considered an AG who‚Äôs openly admitted that he‚Äôd undermine the Mueller Investigation; and he‚Äôs welcomed a #shutdown days before Christmas. 4/ #mepolitics In the past week, our nation has been rocked by President Trump‚Äôs chaotic Administration... 3/ #mepolitics In his final act as Speaker, Paul Ryan has shown complete disregard for federal workers, many of whom must work over the holidays without a guaranteed paycheck, and is allowing the government to teeter on the verge of a #shutdown to appease President Trump. 2/ #mepolitics Since June, seven bills that were deliberated and approved by Republicans and Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee to fund the government have been waiting for a vote. Inexplicably, Republican leadership has refused to pass these bipartisan measures. 1/ #mepolitics Memo to Republicans who control EVERY lever of the federal government: Trump promised that Mexico would pay for his $5 billion boondoggle. 

The GOP never holds him accountable and the American people always pay the price. #mepolitics The Republicans‚Äô ChristmasüéÑ present to the American people is chaos:

Our government is on the verge of a Trump shutdown. 

AG designee said he‚Äôd undermine Mueller. 

Interior Sec left in disgrace. 

Defense Sec #Mattis has quit.

As they've been unsuccessful in ripping health care from millions through the legislative process, they‚Äôve turned to the courts to accomplish their goal. #mepolitics 3/ If #TexasvUS is allowed to stand, it would eliminate fundamental consumer protections for tens of thousands of Mainers, including for those with preexisting conditions, threaten Medicaid expansion, and eliminate many cost saving initiatives that benefit seniors. #mepolitics 2/ In one fell swoop, days before Christmas, a single partisan judge‚Äôs decision could strip health care access from millions of Americans. #mepolitics 1/ https://t.co/7JdaAU2sLS Though I‚Äôm sure Tonto is a very nice horse. üê¥ Good riddance to Ryan Zinke and the horse he literally rode in on. https://t.co/triFovIXPZ USDA just announced $600 million available to improve rural broadband.

https://t.co/YLoUjhSna7 https://t.co/527UWRViwd Absolutely infuriating to see Administration help Big Oil fleece consumers in such a way‚Äîespecially in a rural state like Maine where people depend on their vehicles to work &amp; get around and have tight budgets to fuel them #mepolitics https://t.co/9xQiLdBz1m The oil industry wanted weaker vehicle efficiency standards so it could extract more $$ from people‚Äôs wallets

The Trump Administration was more than happy to support their secret campaign, even though it will cost consumers billions

Here are some of the highlights for our communities #mepolitics ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/zyWV9O6TTT The #FarmBill contains provisions that I fought to include on behalf of #Maine‚Äôs farmers &amp; rural economy.

But I‚Äôm relieved partisan provisions have been stripped (SNAP work reqs, King Amend) &amp; think it will serve families and rural communities well while helping farmers take advantage of the opportunities before them #mepolitics A few provisions I introduced included in final #FarmBill
1. Produce prescription pilot program
2. Creation &amp; permanent funding for LAMP (1-stop shop for federal local food programs) 
3. More than doubling funding for organic research
4. Food waste initiatives
#mepolitics https://t.co/6kTjCLVwrR I plan to vote in support of the #FarmBill released today.
