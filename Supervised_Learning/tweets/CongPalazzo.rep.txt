Our border security plan is a system of defenses to keep people from entering our country illegally. #SecureTheBorder #BorderNegotiations https://t.co/rHJGJYApAk As a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Committee, I will continue to advocate for increased border security and ensure that we are doing everything in our power to address the humanitarian and security crisis that we are currently facing. https://t.co/qtfDULRFiR Investing in smart, high tech resources will only improve the long-term oversight of who and what are coming through the border. We need to provide more technology to be used along the border. We know that most of the drugs streaming into our country are coming through our ports of entry. It's time that we provide those checkpoints with innovative technology to decrease illegal flows of drugs &amp; weapons. With additional migrant caravans heading our way, we need more boots on the ground actively monitoring all suspicious activity. While at the border, I was taken aback by the professionalism &amp; commitment of those already working to secure the border. Our goal should be to improve the existing barriers, and implement new physical barriers where they are needed. https://t.co/kKIvVx6s2x Where we already have walls, we've seen dramatic decreases in illegal border crossings. In both Yuma and San Diego, where walls have been built, illegal border crossings have dropped 95%, helping our CBP agents to focus their efforts on other parts of their enforcement strategy. https://t.co/XXu3QsZFcG I returned to DC this week after taking a trip to the border to inspect existing walls, meet with @CBP &amp; @ICEgov experts, and learn about our ports of entry. 

I walked away w/3 major takeaways.
1) we need a wall
2) we need more personnel
3) we need more tech https://t.co/APJEpaIa6o I joined @Varneyco to provide an update on where we are in border security negotiations. 

I believe, we need to look at securing our borders as a multifaceted approach. It‚Äôs up to the conference committee to produce a bipartisan bill the President can sign. #SecureTheBorder https://t.co/p7bOGx0AHb Our bill is a step in the right direction to provide relief for the employers that sometimes must choose between their own bottom line and patriotic duty to hire service member.

Today, I joined my House colleagues in writing Secretary Azar of HHS, urging the agency to issue an moratorium on funding any research that uses aborted fetal tissue. Fetal tissue research hasn't produced any clinical treatments, and should not be performed at taxpayer expense. I applaud HHS for ending this contract, and am urging them to continue protecting innocent babies. Recently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cancelled a contract for "fresh" human fetal tissue, meaning that aborted babies are treated like test subjects while promoting the sale of their body parts.

We are taking necessary steps to defend our border against those attempting to enter the United States illegally.  #BorderSecurity Republicans understand the importance of securing our border and ensuring those who wish to enter our country do so legally, unlike Democrats who have advocated to abolish ICE and weaken border security.
