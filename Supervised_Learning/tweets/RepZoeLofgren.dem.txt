This bill is supported by the Trump Administration, and nothing would stop the communications collected, stored, and accessed by law-enforcement agencies from being used as a weapon against #immigrant families for investigation, detention, and deportation. The House will vote on reauthorizing #section702 surveillance tomorrow. This program collects communications - including emails, phone calls, text messages, photos, and more - of individuals inside in the United States who communicate with individuals outside the United States.

You can read that analysis here: https://t.co/TKuhcn0RNA https://t.co/b9tISe4gDj This will not just affect Salvadorans, but also their U.S. citizen spouses and children, the American employers and employees who depend on them, and the countless communities across the Unites States they helped build and live in today. https://t.co/0hoOz7ngW7 It forces Salvadoran #TPS holders to reconcile the danger that will face their families and loved ones upon return to El Salvador, with the prospect of tearing their families apart, and the uncertainty of undocumented status in the United States. https://t.co/E33yg7RCnf Yet in one stroke, today‚Äôs decision from President Trump rips legal #TPS status from nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, many of whom have spent decades legally in the United States, starting families, working, studying, and contributing to their communities. https://t.co/T7ETpnXLY4 El Salvador has among the highest murder rates in the world, including one of the highest rates of femicide. In 2015, a woman was murdered every 16 hours in El Salvador. And from 2010 to 2013, 95 percent of murders in the region were unsolved or unprosecuted. https://t.co/hmOIYOqz6P President Trump‚Äôs decision to strip TPS from Salvadorans, many of whom have legally lived and worked in this country for decades, is shameful and wrong.
