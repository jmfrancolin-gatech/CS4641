Several other FBI and DOJ officials have denounced @realDonaldTrump's characterization of the #MuellerInvestigation as a "witch hunt".

https://t.co/sP4TEn45Na In the 8 years the @HouseGOP held the House majority, our country saw historic hurricanes, raging wildfires, long droughts &amp; major floods. Yet Republicans held ZERO hearings on climate change. We can’t ignore our 🌎 any longer. Time to #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/g03BT9jmFT This week the people’s House is holding hearings on
✅ climate change
✅ gun violence
✅ minimum wage
for the first time in EIGHT years. 

That's what an agenda #ForThePeople looks like. We should be able to find bipartisan agreement on several issues including infrastructure, workforce development &amp; lowering the costs of healthcare. I know @HouseDemocrats are ready to roll up their sleeves and tackle these issues. Let’s get to work. #SOTU Job #1 is to fully fund the government &amp; prevent another needless, harmful government shutdown. Congress is working right now to agree on a bipartisan funding package to provide certainty for federal agencies &amp; make smart, bipartisan investments in border security. #SOTU In the coming months, @RepGallagher and I will re-introduce our bill to require all medical providers to publicly disclose costs for all products, services and procedures. We must improve transparency and accountability in the healthcare market. #bipartisanship #SOTU RT @JECDems: The #economy has added jobs for 100 consecutive months; the first 76 of those months came during the Obama administration.  #S… Our economy is strong but no thanks to @realDonaldTrump.

https://t.co/WOo3WoocfB Exactly the question I've been asking since day one: why? #WhatAreYouHiding #WhatAreYouAfraidOf #FollowTheFacts
https://t.co/r74cuWi5Qn Federal workers are not political pawns. That's why I'm cosponsoring @RepBrendanBoyle's HR 809 which provides for an automatic 90-day continuing resolution if there's a lapse in gov't funding. The jobs and livelihoods of federal workers should never be held hostage again. Are you a federal worker wondering how to repay the unemployment benefits now that you've returned to work or what happens if there's a future shutdown? Check the @ColoradoLabor website to help answer your questions &amp; find important information.

Reopening the full gov't is the right thing to do. I look forward to having a serious debate about effective solutions to strengthen our borders, create jobs, allow Dreamers to stay in the US &amp; provide earned pathway to citizenship for those paying taxes &amp; not committing crimes. Obstruction, witness tampering &amp; false statements from a guy who is a longtime ally of both Paul Manafort &amp; @realDonaldTrump.

https://t.co/HqXHr9XBOE Starting today, Enroll Jeffco will allow @JeffcoSchoolsCo parents the ability to shop online for schools and enroll online starting in January. Check it out here: https://t.co/G0XYDLQ1Db.
https://t.co/p25PascSxZ RT @elizacollins1: Two reports submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee found that Russians used millions of posts to boost Trump, ca… Zinke's time in office was the epitome of the #CultureOfCorruption seen in the Trump Administration and his polices were disastrous for our public lands, environment, and clean air &amp; water. Glad to see him go. https://t.co/OBlBBqC2El This ruling will be appealed and has no immediate consequences for the hardworking families who depend on affordable and accessible healthcare. I will continue to fight to make sure the ACA is upheld and remains a civil right for everyone. https://t.co/u5X8Bsu3G9 ICYMI - Michael Cohen is not the only person in @realDonaldTrump's orbit to go to jail. #FollowTheFacts #WhatAreYouHiding #LetMuellerWork
https://t.co/ZuHHWQfM2o This is unacceptable. We need to make sure all Coloradans feel the benefits of a strong economy, starting with a good-paying job that allows hardworking families to afford their mortgage, pay for college, and save for retirement. https://t.co/CjrNwI3d9r Congrats to these young men, and keep up the good work!
https://t.co/rRewWgcSGX Don't forget! Today is the LAST DAY to sign up for health insurance. Make sure you and your family are covered starting January 1, 2019! https://t.co/gdCB8Gtnnp Today marks the 6th anniversary of the unspeakable tragedy of the Sandy Hook shooting. I stand with my Democratic colleagues to continue to fight for gun violence prevention measures to keep our kids, our constituents and our communities safe. #HonorWithAction #NeverForget In case you're up at 2am tonight...
https://t.co/74iOz1X4Sc Congrats to @virgingalactic on a successful flight! https://t.co/iwOQ6FsRJC Turns out @realDonaldTrump was actually part of the cover up and conspiracy. #FollowTheFacts #WhatAreYouHiding 
https://t.co/oA7lCQFYho The A-Line and G-Line are important modes of transportation for many of my constituents. We are counting on all parties to live up to their obligations and provide the service agreed to. https://t.co/w2icYL34JY I've heard from constituents who are frustrated by delays &amp; loss of service-and I share their frustrations. This is a critical form of transportation for my district &amp; across the region. All parties must work together to ensure safety &amp; continued progress. https://t.co/s93Vt0fM2W I have pushed for new leadership because I want to see generational change in the Democratic Caucus. I am now convinced that generational change has started and will continue to accelerate. Therefore, I will support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. https://t.co/1NEbgMIPVn Today is the 3rd anniversary of the adoption of the groundbreaking #ParisAgreement. By abandoning the agreement, @realDonaldTrump has jeopardized our economy &amp; threatened the health and safety of our communities. We have to stop these reckless actions and #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/cs69Po9d6I Cohen is one of several people in @realDonaldTrump's orbit that will serve jail time. #FollowTheFacts #WhatAreYouHiding 
https://t.co/VSdQTtT6zC The statement that "Mexico will pay for the wall" is just one of many false claims made by @realDonaldTrump. In fact, Trump has made so many false claims, he's in a category all by himself.
https://t.co/9UzDZ5t8Rc The last major #GOPShutdown in 2013 cost the economy 120,000 jobs and $24 billion. But @realDonaldTrump continues to sabotage any opportunity to reach a bipartisan consensus on immigration, instead choosing to keep pushing an immoral, expensive and ineffective border wall. https://t.co/m550VYngFE This is one of the toughest jobs at the White House, even tougher for a President like @realDonaldTrump. It was only a matter of time before Kelly left &amp; I'm not surprised folks aren't lining up to replace him. This could lead to even more chaos at WH... https://t.co/TrjdIdxLiu Did you miss my e-news this weekend? Click here to see what you need to do by December 15th and other important reminders and information.
https://t.co/855wCTXgns Last November, I called for an investigation into reports of the Air Force's mishandling of this case. We need to do everything we can to prevent deadly weapons from getting into the hands of criminals &amp; other dangerous individuals. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/zd77RiAA3C The @CFPB Director has a responsibility to hold big banks &amp; fin. institutions accountable &amp; protect hardworking families from predatory practices. I look forward to working w/Ms. Kraninger &amp; continuing to advocate for consumers &amp; their financial security.
https://t.co/n16OXD7IiM ONE WEEK LEFT to #GetCovered. Deadline is December 15th! https://t.co/Mc1ro8a0uG I will continue to learn more about Mr. Barr's record and positions but I expect any Attorney General to ensure the #MuellerInvestigation can #FollowtheFacts and be allowed to reach its natural and appropriate conclusion. 
https://t.co/fPbSfrcizG RT @NBCNews: "Hello, NBC ... It is no joke. It is a real war."

Listen to the live radio breaking news broadcast to NBC during the attack o… Remembering #PearlHarborDay 77 years later and the 2,403 U.S. citizens who were killed during the attack. https://t.co/VTjKMtAHA1 Important information for both individuals and businesses during tax season and all year long. #TaxSecurity https://t.co/pxKWLDXo78 There's a lot that has been uncovered by the #MuellerInvestigation but many more questions need to be answered. We need to #FollowTheFacts and #LetMuellerWork. 
https://t.co/9QXBdhB6eB The SAFE Banking Act would ensure the #marijuana industry can access our banking system and reduce the public safety risk of having cash on our streets &amp; in our communities. @RepDennyHeck and I plan to continue pushing our legislation in the next Congress. https://t.co/A2EConhYw9 Today's service honors the life of a true statesman whose patriotism, integrity and service to country will always be remembered. #Remembering41
https://t.co/04M70IFFdP Don't let your guard down this holiday season. Learn to recognize and avoid phishing scams that pose as trusted sources, like financial institutions or the #IRS. https://t.co/XlSPr68r17 Are you covered yet? Don't forget, the deadline to enroll for 2019 is December 15th! #GetCovered https://t.co/FGxHyvFm8f I've long argued that @realDonaldTrump should make his tax returns available and they should be released publicly, just as other Presidents have. RT if you agree. 
https://t.co/k3eCCLcYa1 RT @NASAInSight: I landed on #Mars a week ago today. Here’s what I’ve been up to so far:
✅ Snap first images
✅ Open solar panels
✅ Check he… Machine guns and fully automatic weapons have been banned for decades and any device that makes a semi-automatic weapon into a military-grade weapon should be outlawed. I hope this final rule makes that clear once and for all.
https://t.co/wb5GzhGYo3 @KToltz Thank you, Ken. I couldn't agree more. Yet @realDonaldTrump continues to
make unrealistic demands for border wall funding and use the threat of a government shutdown to sabotage bipartisan consensus on immigration. We need to protect #Dreamers.
https://t.co/JhWtg1tpzF From my family to yours, wishing you joy and peace during this year's Festival of Lights. Happy Hanukkah! #Hanukkah2018 Being able to gather with close friends and family is what makes any holiday complete yet the Pittsburgh community finds itself incomplete this Hanukkah. Let's help them ensure that light can be the message; let's #HonorWithAction.
https://t.co/cYlV0pKtPT More exciting news from a great Colorado company! Lockheed Martin's Osiris-Rex will spend a year studying Bennu and gathering asteroid samples for the first time in U.S. history. 
https://t.co/zVt6PRRYNG Trump, his family &amp; his campaign have been nothing but dishonest about their relationships w/ Russia. @HouseDemocrats will make sure the #MuellerInvestigation continues to its natural conclusion so Americans can find out the truth about the 2016 election. https://t.co/kO5REe2jAt #Bush41 had a remarkable career in public service and his contributions to this country were significant. Condolences to the entire Bush family. https://t.co/zdZzS6eESr RT @RepMaloney: 25 yrs ago today, President Clinton signed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act into law. We've passed #guncontrol leg… Great news for Colorado with the selection of Deep Space Systems and Lockheed Martin Space! This mission is another important step toward sending our astronauts to Mars by 2033. #Mars2033 https://t.co/oZbWglNW5Z The DOJ needs the stability of a qualified, Senate-confirmed Attorney General so that it can effectively carry out all of its responsibilities. And the #MuellerInvestigation needs an unbiased AG who will ensure it can reach its natural conclusion.
https://t.co/xHLIhtnax9 This guilty plea shows once again that many of Trump's closest allies were willing to lie to Congress about Trump's business ties and other dealings during the 2016 campaign. We must allow the #MuellerInvestigation to continue to #FollowTheFacts. 
https://t.co/PKhjb07xhY .@realDonaldTrump ran on a promise of having Mexico pay for a wall on our southern border. Like so many of his promises, he is now backtracking and instead threatening to shut down the government if Congress doesn’t stick taxpayers with a $5 billion bill. https://t.co/qlfrdpFki4 #DidYouKnow: #NFIP makes flood insurance easily accessible &amp; helps communities prepare for the financial impact of flooding. If Congress cannot come together to reauthorize this program, Americans will not have access to federal flood insurance. #ReauthorizeNFIP Climate change will be expensive, wreak havoc on our communities and threaten public health. This is one of multiple reports warning of these dire consequences. It's time for immediate action. #ActOnClimate
https://t.co/nghVcS9ufW Today’s news of coordination between Manafort’s legal team &amp; the President’s legal team further illustrates the need for legislation to protect the #MuellerInvestigation. @HouseDemocrats will ensure it is allowed to continue &amp; reach its natural conclusion.
https://t.co/ueE0QupNgD RT @NASAInSight: There’s a quiet beauty here. Looking forward to exploring my new home. #MarsLanding https://t.co/mfClzsfJJr So proud of Colorado's role in the successful landing of @NASAInSight. Congrats to the entire team who made this a success. The mission will provide critical information &amp; is an important step in the long-term goal of getting astronauts to Mars. #Mars2033 https://t.co/ZeFG3nUmjQ The Trump Admin continues to act in a disgraceful manner when it comes to immigration. These terrible policies &amp; actions continue to make the case for comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security &amp; an earned pathway to citizenship. https://t.co/QB6XkJZJGE DYK - Today some form of marijuana is legal in the majority of states in the U.S.? It's past time we align state and federal law on this issue. This will be one of my many priorities in the new Congress.
