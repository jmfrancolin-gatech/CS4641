Secure the border. 

Compromise. 

Put partisanship aside and get things done. 

Reopen the government. 

And build a wall securing the most vulnerable parts of the southern border. https://t.co/NoFGnOdpqE Two weeks after the start of the #116thCongress, House Democratic leadership continues to refuse to come to the table, negotiate a compromise, secure our borders and put an end to the shutdown. https://t.co/5WiVIzWbKf Last year @CBP seized
