It‚Äôs past time to start fixing our country‚Äôs immigration system. https://t.co/vQJsW5x8KG Learn more about our meeting here: https://t.co/4VrhaPMNiJ The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act will receive a vote in the House this week, and will help facilitate fire prevention activities on public lands and the adjacent private property around Crooked River Ranch to reduce the risk of wildfire for residents who live there. With over 120,000 acres already burned in central Oregon alone, fire season is well underway in Oregon and across the West. On Friday I was at Crooked River Ranch to discuss legislation I crafted with fire officials and local leaders to help protect the community from wildfire. The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act will allow much-needed management of the excess fire fuels that surround Crooked River Ranch, reducing the danger of wildfire for the community who lives there. Learn more about this plan here: https://t.co/DcqHpOmL9d Today at Crooked River Ranch, I announced that my legislation to protect the local community from wildfire will receive a vote in the House next week. https://t.co/IiJmVn4e0M What an honor to meet with the veterans of American Legion Post 63 in Harney County yesterday. Thank you so much for welcoming me to your post and for your service to our country. https://t.co/oxEpicZj9I It is always a pleasure to meet with the Hammond family in Harney County. Today, I was proud to tell them that @realDonaldTrump is seriously considering pardoning Dwight &amp; Steven. Their sentence was unfair, &amp; it‚Äôs time to bring them back together with their families in Oregon. https://t.co/L2hg1ARFNl Happy Fourth of July! Please join me in remembering the men and women who have served our country in uniform, allowing us to celebrate the freedom, liberty, and way of life we cherish as Americans today. Beautiful day in Sherman County as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and I tour Martin Farms to learn more about their operation, and the issues impacting those who grow our food in Oregon. https://t.co/DMy0wWC3pv Thanks to the team at Barreto Manufacturing for letting me visit with you today. The growth you are seeing and reinvestment you are making in your business and Union County as a result of tax reform is great news! https://t.co/uEEf7EYS0S It is my top priority in Congress to put forth concrete solutions to end this scourge, and the House recently passed my legislation to address the opioid crisis from all angles. Learn more about our work at https://t.co/oEctDoXzCN. Great discussion at Saint Alphonsus Hospital in Ontario today on combating the opioid crisis. The team at Saint Alphonsus is on the front lines of this crisis in our community, and these meetings are crucial to understand what is working on the ground in this fight. https://t.co/jrzMNWT3NU Thanks to the farmers, ranchers and community leaders who joined me for a conversation on trade, the farm bill &amp; other issues impacting those who grow our food. Thanks to Steve Baker &amp; Grant Kitamura for the tour of your new onion packing facility, &amp; for hosting today‚Äôs meeting. https://t.co/CO7Olneuwp Check out my latest newsletter to learn about my legislation to combat the #opioidcrisis, funding support for rural communities in OR, and a bill that passed the House that will help improve care for Vietnam veterans: https://t.co/ejo94zooWV President Trump can right this wrong. I again strongly urged the President to administer the justice that is long overdue for these eastern Oregon ranchers by granting them a pardon so that they can get back to Harney County and their families. Prosecutorial overzealousness by the federal government under the Obama Administration ignored Judge Hogan‚Äôs judicial discretion, and doubled down, forcing them to serve a mandatory minimum sentence established for terrorists. Multiple editorial boards across Oregon have concurred. https://t.co/58EuDHAhwV Federal Judge Michael Hogan agreed, when he used his discretion to apply more appropriate sentences, calling the mandatory minimum sentence for this case something that would ‚Äòshock the conscious.' The sentencing of Dwight and Steve Hammond to five years in federal prison is unjust. Period. Late Saturday afternoon, President Trump called me to say he is 'seriously considering' pardoning Dwight and Steven Hammond. RT @KTVZ: Rep. Greg Walden says he helped pass legislation to help Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange in the waters off Vietnam and Iraq‚Ä¶ It is time for the President to grant a pardon to Steven and Dwight Hammond. They have served long enough. This is an issue that shocks the conscience. It‚Äôs time for real justice, and @POTUS can administer that. https://t.co/SFkGX3hrno It was great to meet Phoenix High School sophomore and winner of the 2018 Congressional Art Competition, Noor Akil. Noor‚Äôs impressive watercolor, Bluberries, will be showcased in the U.S. Capitol among the best student artwork in the nation. https://t.co/pPjdTHqtCX Good luck to @BeaverBaseball as they take on the Razorbacks in game one of the College World Series Finals tonight. #GoBeavs!: https://t.co/bX5cmJtn5r #ICYMI: Check out my guest column in @thebulletin about our historic efforts to strike back against the #opioidcrisis &gt;&gt; https://t.co/CmOctt1BxI The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act passed the House by a strong bipartisan vote of 396-14, sending the clear signal that striking back against the #opioidcrisis is something that transcends politics &gt;&gt;https://t.co/JfRydjnEOd Today, we have an opportunity to continue our work in combating the #opioidcrisis, an opportunity to save lives, and we cannot let it pass. We owe it to our families, friends, communities, and our country to lift people out of addiction and, together, win this fight. https://t.co/Ivoe2myfwv Across our district, I‚Äôve heard heartbreaking stories from victims and families who are impacted by the #opioidcrisis.

Looking forward to continuing to work toward our shared goal of ending the #CrisisNextDoor &gt;&gt; https://t.co/NmpDqlY9ed Mike's story about how the #opioidcrisis has impacted his family is all too similar &amp; all too familiar. Mike, today we are acting on your behalf &amp; on behalf of countless American families who are dealing with this tragedy. https://t.co/sAcRcECeS3 RT @HouseCommerce: ‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to save lives.

As part of the Honor Flight of Central Oregon, these heroes from WWII &amp; the Korean War traveled across the country to see the memorials established in their honor on the National Mall. https://t.co/AbQpPHxpoY I applaud President Trump for signing this commonsense plan into law, and look forward to working alongside the Administration to ensure the successful implementation of this program on the ground in Oregon and across the country. Learn more here: https://t.co/axmBFwrodl Research in the private sector has shown that allowing scribes to handle electronic health records allows the doctor to see more patients in a timely manner, and this bill will help bring that success to our veterans at the VA. GOOD NEWS: My plan to improve the care Oregon veterans receive at the VA was signed into law today. The VA Medical Scribe Pilot Act will help free up doctors to do what they do best: take care of patients. On June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 Allied troops embarked on the ‚Äògreat crusade‚Äô in defense of freedom during WWII. As we honor the bravery of these men 74 years later, please join me in thanking all of those who have worn our nation‚Äôs uniform, and those who wear it today. https://t.co/arMldoBNu8
