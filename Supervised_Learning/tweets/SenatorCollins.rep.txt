I joined @Gillibrandny &amp; @SenJackReed in introducing a bill to protect current &amp; future transgender troops. https://t.co/BUdVOu9NMP I strongly believe that anyone who is qualified and wants to serve should continue to be allowed to do so, including our transgender troops. We should be expressing our gratitude to those who serve our country in uniform, not trying to kick them out of the military.

I wonder why my colleagues are always the most excited when it‚Äôs my turn to host Thursday lunch? ü¶û https://t.co/Q4ucfwaT6E Well said, @SenatorShaheen.  From Acadia to Denali, and everywhere in between, our bipartisan legislation would allow disabled veterans to more easily access our country‚Äôs national treasures for outdoor recreation, which can help heal both the visible and invisible wounds of war. https://t.co/IAdkdeNLQr LWCF, our most important conservation program, has created outdoor recreation opportunities across the country. To ensure LWCF continues to benefit present &amp; future generations, I joined a bipartisan group in intro'ing a bill to permanently reauthorize it. https://t.co/htbV3vk829 What a fantastic tradition. Enjoy this year‚Äôs game and Go Pats! https://t.co/wvuSAshbSX As a state w/ one of the most veterans per capita &amp; thousands of skilled shipyard workers, ME has long been pivotal to our national security. It‚Äôs fitting that @USNAVY will name a new ship after our capital to honor the citizens who have answered the call to serve our country. https://t.co/8XxsifppRj No individuals should be barred from serving on a jury because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. A bill I have introduced with @SenatorShaheen, who is always a leader in the fight against discrimination, would ensure this right. https://t.co/y2nQ2qOrEA This legislation will have a direct impact on improving care for Alzheimer‚Äôs patients. Thank you for your continued support and advocacy to address this public health crisis. https://t.co/c8qruzFv50 Thank you for being such strong advocates for agriculture! @sustainableag members like @mainefarms, @mofga, &amp; @CEIMaine were invaluable resources throughout the Farm Bill process, helping to identify pressing needs of Maine farmers and providing critical expertise and data. https://t.co/nM5a2kWrbh I am so proud of the key role the men and women of BIW have played in ensuring our service members have the most advanced technology, equipment, &amp; ships. BIW workers‚Äô skill and dedication go into every ship they build, and the USS Carl M. Levin will be no exception. https://t.co/3DbX6nlPmJ At a keel laying ceremony for the USS Carl M. Levin at BIW today, I joined @secnav76 and the rest of the Maine delegation in honoring my friend @SenCarlLevin.  Sen. Levin‚Äôs extraordinary record of public service was defined by his unwavering support of our armed forces. https://t.co/RksEStBtjX Rebates should lower the costs that consumers pay at the pharmacy counter, not pad the pockets of middle men. I look forward to working with @SecAzar to fix this broken system &amp; ensure that Americans can afford the medicines they need. 
https://t.co/Ck0NSWVI1P In ME, we have only 40 geriatricians for more than 260,000 people over 65
 
We're facing a nationwide shortage of these professionals. There are fewer than 7,300 today, &amp; we'll need 30,000 by 2030

My &amp; @SenBobCasey's Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would help close this gap https://t.co/9fPk2Pu77k Americans lost $1.7 billion in 2016 to criminals who assumed their identity and filed false tax returns. To protect Americans from fraudsters who seek to steal their tax refunds, I introduced the Taxpayer Identity Protection Act with @SenDougJones. https://t.co/pInP6gaylN This shutdown must come to an end. Today I voted twice to reopen government because it is my top priority. 
 
Compromise is a sign of strength, not weakness. We must come together to end this harmful impasse. https://t.co/37RIBEqj6H WATCH Live: Senator Collins speaks on the Senate floor about her ongoing efforts to reopen government. It's long overdue for all sides to come together to end this shutdown.
https://t.co/HwhqAr8xAd Senator Collins‚Äô statement on the President‚Äôs proposal to reopen government: https://t.co/5JdONCOlfF I‚Äôm very sorry to learn from @SenAngusKing that he has started to undergo treatment for residual prostate cancer.  His attitude is upbeat and the prognosis is excellent.  Knowing Angus, this won‚Äôt slow him down a bit!  I look forward to our continued work together. 4/4 Jon, who died defending our nation, and Jason, who dedicated his life to improving the lives of others, enriched our state and had a positive impact on countless individuals. I extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends. 3/4 Jason Spindler‚Äîa graduate of @HebronAcademy‚Äîwas killed by members of the terrorist organization al-Shabab while working in Kenya to lift African communities out of poverty. 2/4 Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan Farmer‚Äîan alumnus of @BowdoinCollege and a Green Beret who earned numerous medals, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart‚Äîwas killed by ISIS, alongside another American service member and two civilians. 1/4 This week, two separate terrorist attacks took from us two individuals with ties to Maine. The signing of this bill I authored with @SenatorCardin is a good first step in providing relief for federal workers. While guaranteeing back pay will help give some peace of mind, a compromise must be reached to bring this shutdown to an end. https://t.co/RefRPmJksr I‚Äôll vote to disapprove Treasury‚Äôs easing of sanctions on Russian businesses involving oligarch &amp; Putin ally Oleg Deripaska.  He still would maintain significant control given his ties to Putin.  Easing the sanctions sends the wrong message to Russia &amp; to Deripaska. I talked to a waitress in Bangor this morning whose husband works for TSA. They literally had to get a loan to pay their mortgage for this month. That's just wrong. I continue to believe that a compromise is possible because this is a problem that we have to solve. The Senate unanimously passed a bill @SenatorCardin &amp; I authored that ensures federal workers affected by the partial government shutdown will receive retroactive pay. While this will help provide some peace of mind, we must bring this impasse to an end. Having visited more than 200 schools in ME, I know a great school is like a winning team where everyone does their best. Dr. Levesque Elementary in Frenchville should be proud to be named a Blue Ribbon School‚Äì 1 of 3 in ME this year &amp; among only 349 nationwide to win this honor. https://t.co/bThRasybRK The need to end the partial government shutdown is urgent. Lives are being affected by this impasse. Congress should reopen much of the government immediately while negotiations continue. It is not a sign of weakness to try to figure out a middle ground. It is a sign of strength. Both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen &amp; to compromise. https://t.co/iHv7zkVXJE Shutdowns represent a failure to govern &amp; harm those who interact with the closed agencies as well as federal employees &amp; their families. As we work to end this shutdown, @SenatorCardin &amp; I introduced a bill to ensure these civil servants are paid. Congratulations to my colleague @SenAngusKing who was sworn into a second term today. I was honored to join the tradition of accompanying him as he took the oath and look forward to our continued work together on behalf of the people of Maine. https://t.co/1OmXlePmPx RT @jacksonlab: ‚ÄúAt JAX we are committed to finding #Alzheimers treatments and even stopping it before it starts," said JAX Pres &amp; CEO @liu‚Ä¶ For the 28,000 Mainers &amp; millions of Americans living w/ Alzheimer‚Äôs, help is on the way. The BOLD Act‚Äîlegislation I wrote w/ @SenCortezMasto‚Äîwas signed into law. It provides $100M over 5 years &amp; takes a public health approach to improve Alzheimer‚Äôs prevention, treatment, &amp; care. Good news for the Coast Guard! White House staff called to tell me CG members will receive their paychecks as did other federal employees. I continue to work to end the shutdown, but this will provide immediate relief to CG members &amp; their families. https://t.co/lcH63g1U3U Military members are paid under a different schedule than civilian employees. The most recent pay period for the military started on Dec. 16 and runs through Dec. 31. Though the partial shutdown largely doesn‚Äôt impact the Defense Department and members of the military in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, the same isn‚Äôt true for the U.S. Coast Guard, a Department of Homeland Security subcomponent that lacks full-year 2019 appropriations. Most federal employees will receive their scheduled paychecks today, but that is not the case for 42,000 Coast Guard members, who will not be paid for pre-shutdown work because they are under a different pay system.  This is not fair. I called the WH to urge an immediate fix. Great news for BIW! The Navy has awarded an additional destroyer to the shipyard, proving once again that ‚ÄúBath built is best built.‚Äù  This additional ship will help keep the workload stable in the years ahead for the hardworking men &amp; women of BIW https://t.co/KWSks50pet Defense Secretary Mattis has served our country with honor and distinction for many years. His departure is a real loss for our nation, our troops, and this Administration. In a transformative step in the fight against Alzheimer‚Äôs, the bipartisan BOLD Act will be signed into law. This new law will turn decades of research into practice &amp; help improve the lives of the 5.5 million Americans and their families who are living with this disease. Almost half of federal inmates released from prison are rearrested, &amp; nearly a fourth end up back behind bars. The #FirstStepAct will help to end the recidivism epidemic by creating programs to rehabilitate low-risk offenders, making our communities safer &amp; saving taxpayer money. Following a letter I sent to @Energy, funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program was announced with more than $3.5 million for Maine. This helps low-income seniors &amp; families reduce the cost of heating &amp; cooling their homes through energy efficiency improvements. There‚Äôs no justification for bump stocks that transform semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. That‚Äôs why I cosponsored a bill to ban them. I‚Äôm pleased the Justice Dept. has announced they will ban these dangerous devices. https://t.co/cKJ0jR0mtN 2/ He is my chairman on the HELP committee, where I have worked w/ him on health care, the opioid crisis, &amp; education issues, &amp; my colleague on the Appropriations Committee.

Our bill, which passed the Senate unanimously, creates a public health infrastructure to improve prevention and care. https://t.co/hjniIvsWmP To my friend @SenatorHeitkamp, it has been an honor to serve alongside you. Your state, the country, and the Senate are better because of your contributions. https://t.co/bKUgkc1jD7 I joined Mainers in placing a Wreaths Across America wreath made in Columbia Falls at the U.S. Capitol with flags of the Armed Forces branches and the POW/MIA flag. https://t.co/j3KKgBqdMS I so appreciate the advocacy of @ALZIMPACT &amp; 182 other organizations &amp; the unanimous support of my Senate colleagues for my bipartisan BOLD Act. This bill will help families facing Alzheimer‚Äôs‚Äîone of our greatest public health threats‚Äîby improving prevention, treatment, &amp; care. https://t.co/RHcd9uSN5C 6/ This Farm Bill provides many other great benefits for our state and country. Maine farmers work tirelessly every day to meet the growing demand for locally grown and raised products, and this legislation will provide them with the support they need to succeed. 5/ The Farm Bill also includes a bill I authored with @SenBobCasey to strengthen organic research. I recently discussed this bill with Sarah Alexander, @MOFGA's new executive director, whose organization has been an invaluable resource throughout the Farm Bill negotiations. https://t.co/51frfZTFps 4/ The Dairy Innovation Act, a provision I authored with @SenatorBaldwin, establishes regional initiatives to spur innovation in dairy businesses, modernize existing dairy plants, &amp; support new entrepreneurs. https://t.co/e60EW4ukdP 3/ I also joined my northeastern colleagues in securing improvements to the Northern Border Regional Commission, which funds grants for rural Maine projects that create jobs.

Guardianship is a legal relationship created to protect seniors and adults with diminished or lost capacity. In so many cases, guardians help these protected individuals maintain their financial assets and independence; however, our report shows that abuse is far too prevalent. A report released today by @SenateAging finds that the guardianship system often lacks basic protections &amp; leaves vulnerable Americans at risk of exploitation. We must close the gaps in the system, which is why @SenBobCasey &amp; I authored the Guardianship Accountability Act.

Family caregivers dedicate significant time and attention to care for their loved ones, and as this study reveals, they make countless personal and financial sacrifices to fulfill this essential role. https://t.co/MJtO7h4jZ6 The murder of Jamal Khashoggi as described by the Turkish press is an atrocity.  We must get to the bottom of this, and if the Saudis killed Mr. Khashoggi, those responsible must be held accountable. Statement from Senator Collins and her husband, Tom Daffron, on threatening letter received at their Bangor residence: https://t.co/xBLErGSRwX The opening of @NMCCMaine's Simulation Center marks another great advancement in providing the highest quality clinical experience for students and health care professionals. Truly a landmark moment for health care in our state. https://t.co/2yddeSEujh There really is no place like home, and the commitment, energy, and passion shown by the Aroostook Agency on Aging helps Maine‚Äôs seniors stay in the communities they love. As @SenateAging Chairman, I was delighted to speak at the Agency‚Äôs annual meeting in Caribou. The forest products industry helps drive our local economies and sustain rural communities. I greatly enjoyed meeting with Maine loggers this afternoon. https://t.co/1fjKVXuCcW I voted to block a rule that expands the duration of certain health insurance plans that do not have to cover pre-existing conditions.  We must work together to lower premiums while retaining consumer protections. https://t.co/TZAZiqnvmJ Thank you, @SenAlexander, for your strong support. This new law will help reduce the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/BskXwWoYHU Today the president signed into law a bill I authored with my friend @clairecmc to ban pharmacy ‚Äúgag clauses‚Äù that concealed the lowest price from patients, causing them to overpay. https://t.co/u97SsSjBHD Who would think that using your debit card to buy your Rx drugs could be less expensive than using your insurance card?  It‚Äôs counterintuitive. Americans have the right to know which payment method provides the most savings when purchasing their prescription drugs. Great news that the Old Town mill has been purchased by ND Paper and hopes to have it up and running in a few months, creating more than 100 jobs. https://t.co/zZdkhkk5of My full statement on my decision to support Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to be an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court: https://t.co/FVDdlvYkWG WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins speaks on her decision on how she will vote on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. https://t.co/S0pi1dQ4Zv WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins leads Senate Aging Committee hearing on innovative efforts to lower health care costs and improve health outcomes. https://t.co/NwZrMUJe43 Don and Cindy Roy of Gorham have been playing Franco-American music together for 38 years. Congratulations to both of them on receiving a well-deserved National Heritage Fellowship for their dedication to Maine‚Äôs Quebecois &amp; Acadian musical heritage! https://t.co/aeXlMdIEZK I am pleased to hear Mark Judge has indicated he would cooperate with investigators. I support this sensible agreement. https://t.co/5QtenWGGqb I‚Äôm delighted that my bill to ban gag clauses that prevent pharmacists from telling patients how to pay the lowest possible price for medication is headed to the President‚Äôs desk for signature. This new law will help lower the cost of prescription drugs and save consumers money. The AG made the correct decision to recuse himself from the DOJ investigation into Russia‚Äôs attempts to interfere in our elections. The Deputy AG plays a critical role in overseeing the investigation headed by special counsel Mueller. I‚Äôm very concerned by reports that Deputy AG Rosenstein will either be fired or forced to resign. I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable. Read my full letter to the Chairman &amp; Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee here: https://t.co/WzOXlyPrAA https://t.co/eALSEmPygN Such an approach would provide more continuity, elicit the most information &amp; allow an in-depth examination of the allegations. I'm writing to the Chairman &amp; RM of Judiciary Cmte respectfully recommending that at Monday‚Äôs hearing, counsel for Prof. Ford be allocated time to question Judge Kavanaugh &amp; counsel for the Judge be granted equal time to question Prof. Ford, followed by questions from Senators. WATCH LIVE: Ahead of today‚Äôs vote, Senator Collins speaks from the Senate floor to urge her colleagues to support her bill to prohibit the use of ‚Äúgag clauses,‚Äù an egregious practice that can conceal lower prescription drug prices from patients. https://t.co/0ZOZpPBqKl Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee. What an honor to spend an evening with 38 of America‚Äôs heroes, recipients of the Medal of Honor, and their families &amp; guests. Sec. Mattis, @JayLeno and Chris Wallace were recognized, and I was honored to receive the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Medal of Honor Society. https://t.co/N0zrEJfupx 17 years ago, I joined my colleagues on the Capitol steps where we sang ‚ÄúGod Bless America‚Äù in the wake of the terrorist attacks on our country. We gathered together in a demonstration of resolve &amp; patriotism, not as Republicans &amp; Democrats but as Americans. In what seemed like a moment, September 11th was transformed from a day like any other into one that, forever, will stand alone. The loss we relive reminds us of the value of all that we must protect. The heroism reminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people. https://t.co/N99uByQ5Wl Spent a wonderful hour with President George H.W. Bush at his home in Kennebunkport yesterday. President Bush served his country faithfully and well. And how he loves the State of Maine! ‚ÄúWe simply haven‚Äôt done enough‚Äù - @Jack agrees Twitter must do more to let you know if you‚Äôve been targeted in a foreign influence operation. Much more must be done to protect users &amp; our democracy. https://t.co/AhkTLy7dAl WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins questions executives from Facebook and Twitter regarding their responses to foreign influence operations. https://t.co/KzS7JbGugd I look forward to welcoming back to the Senate my friend Jon Kyl, who served Arizona so ably in the past and will do so once again now that Governor Ducey has appointed him to fill John McCain‚Äôs seat. On this Labor Day, I take special pride that the USS JOHN McCAIN was built by the world‚Äôs best shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works. Here‚Äôs BIW‚Äôs tribute to John &amp; his family, which I shared w/ Cindy McCain who so appreciated it.  https://t.co/j6eiWGtrwq Tom &amp; I are on our way to the memorial service for John McCain at the National Cathedral. Yesterday‚Äôs ceremony in the Rotunda was a moving tribute to John. Victory today for local newspapers! The ITC announced it will reverse the high import taxes it had levied on Canadian newsprint. Decision will help save jobs &amp; ensure our newspapers can continue to have a strong voice in our communities. https://t.co/tW8wFxTkF2 Each year, 200,000 children born in the U.S. are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury, which can lead to serious health issues. @SenatorCarper &amp; I introduced a bill to help protect our nation‚Äôs health &amp; environment by tracking mercury pollution. https://t.co/hhe9fDkUcv WATCH: From the Senate floor, Senator Collins pays tribute to Senator John McCain. https://t.co/CWkOBVdILe TUNE IN: I‚Äôll be speaking with @MatthewGagnon and Joe Regan on @WGANMorningNews at 8:08 a.m.  Click here to listen live: https://t.co/4UyvRuqTDu Senator John McCain is irreplaceable. He will be greatly missed by all of us in the Senate. I spoke with @jaketapper on @CNNSotu this morning to discuss John‚Äôs life and legacy. https://t.co/zjF02EI5q0 John McCain was a great patriot and a close friend.

My husband Tom &amp; I are praying for John McCain, Cindy, and their family. He is a great friend and a true American hero. WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins speaks from the floor about the urgent need to keep increasing funding for Alzheimer‚Äôs research. Robust funding for Alzheimer‚Äôs research will help us usher in a new era in our battle against this devastating disease. https://t.co/3QEFWbPdW4 But Maine is also located at the end of our nation‚Äôs air pollution ‚Äútailpipe,‚Äù receiving pollution generated by power plants in other states. The Administration‚Äôs proposal to rewrite the national standards established by the Clean Power Plan is a step in the wrong direction. In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. And our state has made substantial progress in reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, adopting clean energy technologies, &amp; improving air quality &amp; public health. WATCH LIVE: Senator Collins speaks from the Senate floor in support of the defense funding bill, which is vitally important to ensure our men &amp; women in uniform, as well as DOD civilians, have the training &amp; equipment they need to defend our nation. https://t.co/85HM2j2Da3 In a more than two-hour meeting in my office today, Judge Kavanaugh &amp; I had a productive, informative discussion about a wide range of issues, including: his judicial philosophy, his respect for precedent, &amp; the importance of an independent judiciary.  Read my statement here: https://t.co/BSIRUlpfTv Employees of community banks &amp; credit unions know their customers &amp; are well-positioned to spot scams. That‚Äôs why I authored the Senior $afe Act to help improve training &amp; encourage these workers to report financial exploitation, which costs seniors nearly $3 billion each year. When a local bank manager noticed unusual withdrawals on an account owned by Dawn Shaw, a retired legal secretary in Maine, she notified Dawn‚Äôs family &amp; stopped this fraudulent activity. https://t.co/AJqVDZHRbN RT @Ready_Nation: .@SenatorCollins provided remarks via video for today's event at @ThomasCollege. She discussed the college's EDGE program‚Ä¶ My dear friends, Senators Bob and Elizabeth Dole, are tremendous advocates for all our military caregivers.

Congrats, Chief! https://t.co/vpXp97KaDB Auburn Police Chief Phil Crowell is an extraordinary leader. I was so glad to be in Auburn today to celebrate his retirement &amp; thank him for his 25 years of exceptional service.  I also gave him a special present: an American flag I had flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor. https://t.co/ZQIl5sjTLy Aretha Franklin was not only one of the world's greatest singers, she was an icon &amp; the undisputed ‚ÄúQueen of Soul.‚Äù I once had the privilege of watching Aretha perform ‚ÄúRespect,‚Äù an anthem for countless women. RIP, Aretha. Your music leaves behind a lasting legacy. When Maine native Jason Maxwell saw a man drowning in the Port of Seattle, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to dive into the freezing water to rescue him.  Jason is a shining example of the willingness of Maine people to help those in need, and we are so proud of his heroic actions. https://t.co/rJ2Yplp0ba The loss of Chris Cousins leaves a hole that will be felt by his family and friends, by his colleagues, and by his readers who relied on Chris‚Äô insightful reporting. This touching tribute encapsulates the wonderful man he was. https://t.co/iO4OCFcEPv .@PewTrusts is an amazing partner in our effort to combat rising drug costs.

I wrote to these girls to let them know how proud I am of their hard work to help others. https://t.co/iVeKjwTX1j Who would think that using your debit card to pay for Rx drugs would be less expensive than using your insurance card?  You have a right to know when you can get your medications cheaper.  Read my @bangordailynews column on an egregious practice that could be costing you money. https://t.co/NmPhesEEtj The movie Hidden Figures tells the stories of the brilliant African-American women who played a pivotal role at @NASA during the Space Race.
