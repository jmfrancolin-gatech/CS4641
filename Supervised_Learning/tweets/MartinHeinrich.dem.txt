I’m proud to work with key stakeholders to find common ground on pragmatic, responsible solutions to address the needs along our southern border. The Trump administration’s cruel and reckless immigration policies are endangering the lives of asylum seekers and straining resources and capacity at remote CBP locations. https://t.co/ZksBjAhtW0 We need the @EPA to take the issue of PFAS contamination seriously.

https://t.co/JxBA1EOlOZ BLM needs to take a step back and let New Mexicans and tribal communities have a say before they move forward. Chaco Canyon is a sacred site that is revered by New Mexicans and deserves to be protected from any harmful development that would damage its precious historical and cultural resources. It is shameful that the Trump Administration is moving ahead with this sale and has left the public out of the process that was fast-tracked during the shutdown. https://t.co/cOzTvO1UDN This is unacceptable. @DHSgov needs to take the appropriate steps to reunite the families that they ordered to be separated. They must be held accountable. https://t.co/ZfVl3eL7pu He clearly doesn’t believe in science and has no faith in American innovation. https://t.co/4jd6feX2rX Not only did the administration prove why we don’t need a wall, the president himself can’t distinguish Border Patrol Agents from CBP Officers at ports of entry. Hard to take them seriously on their demands for a wall when they don’t understand the basics. https://t.co/kJWB3qWl0l Today marks the start of #BlackHistoryMonth, a time to recognize &amp; honor the Black men &amp; women who've fought for a more equal &amp; just society. It's also a time to reflect on the racism &amp; bigotry that still exists today &amp; continue working to make our communities &amp; country stronger. Couldn’t agree more. That’s why I cosponsored legislation to ensure the thousands of federal contractors in New Mexico impacted by Trump's reckless shutdown get the back pay they deserve.

For over a month, he thrust our country into the longest government shutdown in history, using federal workers and contractors as bargaining chips, and leaving long lasting damage to our communities. I am pleased that President Trump has taken this important step to end his prolonged, costly, and unnecessary shutdown. Inaction is a moral failure to the children who are literally our future. The time to stop talking and start doing is right now. This session is the opportunity many of us have been fighting for all our lives.

To do this would be an extraordinary and unprecedented breach of trust by our government. These are some of our brightest students and veterans who came forward based on the promise that our government would not deport them and provided personal information about themselves and their families. Nearly a million Dreamers across the country have come out of the shadows because of the promise that DACA represented, including more than 7,000 from New Mexico.

I’ll continue fighting to advance policies that ensure the integrity of our justice system and make our communities safer. What we've been doing in federal prisons hasn't been working. The bipartisan #FirstStepAct, backed by civil liberties groups &amp; law enforcement agencies, is a great step forward in building safer communities &amp; improving our criminal justice system. https://t.co/S9JwauXQdW And this obstruction yet again prevented the reauthorization of LWCF, a successful program that enjoys support from both sides of the aisle Mike Lee sunk the Sportsmen’s Act tonight We're demanding oversight hearings on the death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin. This tragedy, and the circumstances that led to it, shows the urgent need for effective Congressional oversight over DHS and CBP leadership. https://t.co/iTG7p1RtXM If the recent ACA ruling is upheld, 17 million Americans could lose their health insurance, pre-existing conditions wouldn't be covered &amp; rural hospitals could be at risk of closing. We MUST protect the #ACA We need to pass a permanent ban now. Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan bill with @JeffFlake and @SenCortezMasto to ban bump stocks. 
https://t.co/TDOBwu37cc This is long overdue, but it is not a substitute for a legislative solution.
https://t.co/QIiRvQIUlD My office has been closely monitoring the gasoline spill near Anthony, N.M. We'll continue to work with Kinder Morgan &amp; federal, state &amp; local agencies to ensure residents are informed, a remediation plan is in place &amp; the environmental impact is assessed. https://t.co/gflYzlXIVz RT @JECDems: What would happen if the #ACA was struck down? https://t.co/vO5DpDQUr7 I just voted to pass the #FirstStepAct, a bipartisan bill that will make long overdue reforms to our criminal justice system. A much needed step in #cjreform. RT @Newsweek: Bill Nye The Science Guy breaks down his issue with climate change deniers. https://t.co/E1oE4vjx0t Alzheimer's affects thousands of New Mexicans &amp; their families. Right now, we don't have the infrastructure in place to best address the issue, but that could change. Proud to cosponsor the #BOLDAlzheimersAct which unanimously passed the Senate last week. #ENDALZ https://t.co/2vF73sw3oW The president may think climate change is a hoax, but in the West this “hoax” has serious economic ramifications. The time is now to invest in a cleaner future. https://t.co/LAaV6BkbgS Proud to see the UNM community come together and push for 100% renewable energy by 2050. This generation is stepping up to lead the way in creating a more sustainable future for all of us. https://t.co/r8NsmQdywl From Farmington, N.M. to the #VoiceFinale. Outstanding job @OfficialChevel – your community and fans across the nation are cheering for you. Water is already a scarce resource —especially in New Mexico. This move is reckless and puts our drinking water at risk. https://t.co/3AVriPDMYX These reports reaffirm what we already know: Russia weaponized social media to divide our country and undermine our democracy. What’s clear is that their efforts have not stopped and we must act with urgency to counter this very real threat.
