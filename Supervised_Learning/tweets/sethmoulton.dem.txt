Mr. President, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúpride‚Äù is the word you‚Äôre looking for. A 14 year old girl‚Äôs death could have been prevented if the President did his job and kept our government running. Instead, our National Parks have remained open and unstaffed and three people are dead. https://t.co/jiHAbARxgn Common sense gun reforms like universal background checks are supported by 90% of Americans.

Bottom line: The President of the United States just shut down our government in a political stunt to get American taxpayers to foot the bill for his ineffective border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. And he can‚Äôt even get enough votes in his own party to support him. Dictators advising military operations while our own Secretary of Defense is kept in the dark. Utterly shameful.

Wishing those celebrating in #MA06 and around the country a Happy #Hanukkah! Chag Sameach! Old enough to remember when American Presidents didn‚Äôt let Russian strongmen dictate their schedules. https://t.co/5tcQdBYEJG If anyone in the President‚Äôs Cabinet had ever had to work hard for a living maybe they wouldn‚Äôt play with taxpayer money like it‚Äôs their personal bank account. https://t.co/jIBdDXVioN As I wrote to VA Secretary Wilkie, the fact that the VA is indecisive in doing the right thing for veterans because it is hard is simply disgraceful. https://t.co/roFuOCjc2d Our country has become an asterisk to global leadership. https://t.co/mUDAekEgiV .@nikiinthehouse has been a friend and mentor to me since my first term in Congress. Our state was lucky to have her in Washington and I know she will continue to be an advocate for Massachusetts families in whatever she does in the future. https://t.co/WOGtLUXR9s For years I‚Äôve kept a photo in my office of me as a young Marine with @GeorgeHWBush because, for whatever political differences we have, he was an American hero more than once in his life, and his patriotism should inspire Americans for generations. https://t.co/mMeQ1jbX0A Congrats to my friend and colleague @RepClark! @HouseDems and our state are lucky to have your voice at the leadership table in the next Congress. https://t.co/ng02dVDllY Kompromat: information or reports that could damage someone's reputation. https://t.co/GmjNlIQyfa 10 gigatons of CO2 are emitted each YEAR. A rate unseen in the last 50 million years. Congress must #ActOnClimateChange before it's too late! #ClimateFriday Subpoena power - very legal &amp; very cool https://t.co/bGhyLKzm2Z It turns out the founding fathers had a back up plan in case of moral abdication by the President. https://t.co/lsy5Hb8UbL If weakening black voters‚Äô rights is literally what you‚Äôre ‚Äúknown for‚Äù I don‚Äôt think federal judge is the occupation for you. https://t.co/Bolain0cft Thoughts &amp; prayers https://t.co/Lsx0bk6w9W Donald Trump should not meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss Ukraine. We can‚Äôt afford his concessions. Anyone remember Helsinki? https://t.co/7rKaTJCBGz My statement on SFC Eric Emond: https://t.co/kcCiVqr3Sb The FCC under the Trump administration is yet again giving handouts to corporations at the expense of taxpayers. Rural workers will come to depend on high speed broadband in the coming years, which is why we need to prioritize their connectivity. https://t.co/J9gKFyGWss We can only stop Putin if we work with our allies. Trump has no plan to do so while the Russian military escalates against Ukrainian forces. https://t.co/n2OM99G5e4 I applaud my good friend, Salem @MayorDriscoll, for her leadership in advocating for the commuter rail and workers who depend on it for their livelihoods. We need these voices at the table. https://t.co/InAQ5Wlq1p Silencing the intelligence community... sounds like someone is afraid of the truth. https://t.co/90eYlchiYK This is outrageous. https://t.co/zXPuQqFgTq My heart goes out to the family and friends of the three US service members killed in #Afghanistan today. The White House must explain their regional goal so we can bring our troops home. https://t.co/ue4adKgZeK One more time for the people in the back: right wing extremists commit THE MOST violence of any domestic extremist group. https://t.co/qhxZCDhLWI I look forward to serving with this year‚Äôs historic class of freshmen come January. I‚Äôm especially proud that our Congress is gaining at least 19 members who have served in the military: six in the Army, 11 in the Navy, and two in the Air Force. https://t.co/wUCecfhV7d
