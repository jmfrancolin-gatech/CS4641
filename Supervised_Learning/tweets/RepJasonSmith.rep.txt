Today I joined @VarneyCo on @FoxBusiness and discussed how eliminating the wasteful electric vehicle tax credit will save taxpayers billions and help fund new infrastructure projects. Watch below üì∫‚¨áÔ∏è

https://t.co/GKWyB4jJK1 About to join @VarneyCo on @FoxBusiness to talk about my bill to end the wasteful electric vehicle subsidy. Hope you can tune in! https://t.co/IKKKpUsifp The ‚ÄòGreen New Deal‚Äô would skyrocket energy bills for millions of Americans and lower income families would be the hardest hit. More like a #GreenRawDeal
https://t.co/w63lwD2iLc This week @SenJohnBarrasso and I introduced legislation to end the wasteful electric vehicle tax credit, which benefits the wealthy at everyday Americans‚Äô expense. Learn more how this will save taxpayers $20B and support new infrastructure projects ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/rE9Y8u6NuK https://t.co/3fglCGU8Ih Blessed to spend this morning with people of faith from all over the world at the #NationalPrayerBreakfast. 

‚ÄúThis is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.‚Äù John 5:14 https://t.co/jK5OGjmrze Fact check - the female unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows under this presidency. As we saw last night, Democrats in Congress refuse to celebrate YOUR jobs and can only clap for THEIR jobs. https://t.co/JpqzT63lz8 Coming up! I‚Äôm joining Faune Riggin on @960KZIM in Cape Girardeau to discuss the President‚Äôs stellar speech last night. Listen in here! https://t.co/NPhBGEFRCs #SOTU The State of our Union is STRONG. Unemployment is low, wages are growing and Americans are keeping more of what is theirs. But more work lies ahead. We must lower health care costs, help American workers and farmers and support our President to solve the crisis at our border. https://t.co/DClqGkwYzk Every life is a blessing with dignity and purpose. We have to protect innocent life #SOTU https://t.co/tdzfeiwLAn You can count on my support, Mr. President. Border security is national security. #SOTU https://t.co/xuRWQ0fvuy It‚Äôs ridiculous that Democrats are refusing to stand for keeping our country safe and putting cartels out of business #AmericanSecurityOverPolitics #SOTU The economy is BOOMING under President Trump‚Äôs leadership and I‚Äôm honored that I was able to write the historic tax cuts that along with regulatory relief helped make it possible. #SOTU https://t.co/0qJNvZAOwn I couldn‚Äôt agree more with the President - repealing the death tax is one of the best things we can do for family farmers. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve authored the bill to end the death tax once and for all. #SOTU President Trump is laying out an inspiring vision of American greatness. Couldn‚Äôt be more proud to work with him #SOTU https://t.co/i1KOqtF8Qh Honored to be escorting @realDonaldTrump into the House Chamber for the #SOTU! https://t.co/iL4nh9z0bj President Trump will be delivering the State of the Union address in one hour.

This week is Thank a Farmer week in MO - Remember, if you eat, #ThankAFarmer! https://t.co/Tn2wH6z4Rr The largest illegal fentanyl shipment in history was just seized trying to cross into the US at our southern border. We are clearly at a crisis point and need to act now to secure our borders and keep our country safe. https://t.co/1TM157AihN The CBO‚Äôs most recent report confirms what every American knows - President Trump‚Äôs policies have boosted the economy. From creating jobs to lifting wages, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working. The CBO Director confirmed that reversing course would slow the economy. Watch now ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/YbnT5QmKjT Absolutely disgusting to hear @GovernorVA defend murdering a child minutes before or after birth. Every life is a gift. This is infanticide.

https://t.co/hrzv79vuI5 Where I come from you don't get a pay raise just for showing up to work. Today Dem leaders pushed a $5B pay raise for federal workers who are paid well above the HOUSEHOLD income in southern Missouri. Retweet if you think that money would be better spent to #SecureOurBorder Today I shared the story of MaryAnn and Greg from Missouri who have a pre-existing condition and have struggled to find options with Obamacare. We need more competition and options,not a complete government takeover that forces people to buy plans they can‚Äôt afford. Watch above‚§¥Ô∏è The left tries to say that Republicans don't support protecting pre-existing conditions because we disagree with Obamacare and plans for a government takeover of the healthcare system. In reality it can't provide adequate coverage to those who need it. https://t.co/olLwFozA94 Be safe this week - some places in Missouri may see a wind chill as low as -40 degrees! When it's this cold, frostbite can set in within 10 minutes. Make sure you have everything you need to stay warm and safe during the bitter cold.

https://t.co/kqkjyM5BpL After no one was expected to attend Air Force Veteran Joseph Walker‚Äôs funeral, hundreds traveled to Killeen, Texas to honor his life. Thank you to everyone who made sure he wasn‚Äôt alone. https://t.co/oQDcqEKWjl On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we remember the nearly six million Jewish people senselessly murdered for their beliefs and renew our promise that the world will #NeverAgain experience the horrors of the holocaust. If there is one thing Washington knows how to do best, it‚Äôs kicking the can down the road and punting on solving the problems of today until tomorrow. 5/5 I'm glad that those currently protecting our airports and borders are finally getting paid, but I have no confidence that in 21 days the Democrat leadership will suddenly want to negotiate and we will find ourselves in a better place with plans for a more secure border. 4/5 The Speaker claimed she wouldn‚Äôt negotiate securing the border until the government was reopened, and now she has her shot. 3/5 In response, Speaker Pelosi refused to allow her Caucus to meet with the President, offered no more than $1 to secure our borders, and even went as far as canceling the State of the Union. 2/5 Over the last 35 days of this partial government shutdown, President Trump has been more than reasonable, making offer after offer in good faith to Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer to reach a long term deal to secure the border and reopen the government. 1/5 Make that a THIRD time that House Democrats have prevented agents and members of the Coast Guard from receiving pay. #EndTheGames https://t.co/b6vgBXtMBr Do you support a stronger physical barrier on the southern border?

https://t.co/UiojHkxZN6 https://t.co/j6Agoztbx8 Our border patrol and TSA agents will miss a second paycheck this week, and today for the SECOND time House Democrats stopped an effort to make sure they get paid. #EndTheGames For 100 years, @TheSalemNews has kept my hometown and Dent County informed. It was a pleasure to celebrate their centennial in the U.S. House of Representatives and share my remarks in the Congressional Record with the newspaper staff. https://t.co/aScw01ts3A On December 1st they capped off their perfect 15-0 season where they outscored their opponents 838-80. Having 8 all-state players is a testament to the team's hard work and preparation, and we are all incredibly proud of them! https://t.co/lxg72c4shu I had a blast helping Hayti High School celebrate their football team's historic state championship! https://t.co/YvHjLAYVTx Enhancing rural infrastructure creates jobs and builds a better quality of life for our communities. I met with Semo Port officials and discussed how the $20m grant I helped secure for our region will help farmers and workers move more products to market and boost our economy. https://t.co/G5ybUIprWv Today on Martin Luther King Jr. Day I donated books about his life from the Library of Congress to the Bollinger County Library. I hope they will help people learn about Dr. King‚Äôs courageous life and his fight for civil rights. #MLKDay https://t.co/Kf9cjXNeh8 I am deeply saddened to hear that Scott A.

Working together we can change minds and open hearts to choose life. https://t.co/Lt23yvnc7j As if offering only $1 for border security wasn't bad enough, now Nancy Pelosi is uninviting President Trump to deliver the State of the Union address.

She isn't interested in working with the President at all, only obstructing him.
https://t.co/5je7mdQDtX .@POTUS is ready to make a deal, but he can't even get a call back from House Democrats who have given away their voting cards to Nancy Pelosi. How can you say you serve the American people if you won't even meet with the President of the United States?
https://t.co/7AIsupCYKJ ICYMI: I caught up with Varney &amp; Company to break down how the new Democrat leadership is pushing tax breaks for the wealthiest at the cost of rural America.

https://t.co/Fa7C6wmd7m She says building a wall is "immoral," but that's not what Democrat Leaders were saying just a few years ago. What's really immoral is letting drugs, convicted criminals, gang members, and even terrorists expose our weak borders without taking action. The border security debate has been marked with insanity for years, but especially now with Speaker Pelosi in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives. 

https://t.co/f7MRs9dbSa Calling all high school artists! The 2019 Congressional Art Competition is now accepting entries from high school students in southern Missouri. Local high schools have already been notified how to submit artwork, and you can find more details here ‚¨áÔ∏è

There is a winter storm warning in effect for much of southern Missouri and up to a foot of snow is expected in some areas. If you must leave the house you can check the current road conditions here.
https://t.co/wEOzen35b0 Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity. This week Speaker Pelosi will pass the same appropriations bills as last week, knowing they're DOA in the Senate and @POTUS won't sign them.

End the games. Make a deal. And #SecureOurBorder To the brave officers who put their lives on the line in our communities every day to keep America safe - Thank you. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/mFVTU9Vpty "Some have suggested a barrier is immoral, then why do wealthy politicians build walls around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside." - @POTUS @realDonaldTrump An average of 60k people attempt to cross our border illegally now every month. It's time to end the political games and support the men and women on the front lines dealing with the humanitarian and national security crisis on the southern border #TrumpAddress #SecureOurBorder Nancy Pelosi said building a border wall is "immoral." I think letting criminals and drugs flow into our country uninhibited is immoral. #TrumpAddress #SecureOurBorder In tonight's #TrumpAddress the President is laying out all of the facts that Nancy Pelosi refuses to hear. #SecureOurBorder 

https://t.co/zd254BNPfW .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump will be giving his FIRST address from the Oval Office tonight at 8pm CT on the humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border. You can watch it here or on all the major networks üëâhttps://t.co/VRhKMFik1a I'm working to end this and take another step in the right direction to defend innocent life. For more than 40 years it's been illegal for federal tax dollars to be used to fund abortion services, but a loophole remains where abortion clinics can be subsidized with YOUR tax dollars. 
https://t.co/5AkaWCt0L5 This is absurd. Nancy Pelosi can't come to the table on national security but she can fund abortions overseas with OUR tax dollars. Despicable.

https://t.co/vC3AW60fo6 The #JobsReport is in and good news: Last month the economy created an astonishing 312,000 jobs and real wages for American workers rose at their fastest pace in nine years.

https://t.co/NgKjDFNHEj Wish I was making this up - @HouseDemocrats have been in power for just a few hours and their first act was making it easier to raise taxes and explode the debt while hiding it from the American people. 

Buckle up for a long two years. 

https://t.co/DsjRb6TIa0 In 2018 dozens of Democrats running for office told the American people they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House.

Today they broke that promise. Today is the first day of the #116thCongress. I caught up with @MarkReardonKMOX to talk about what we can expect and how the government shutdown can end. Listen here ‚¨áÔ∏è

Join me at Jen's Diner tomorrow in Poplar Bluff so I can provide an update and relay your thoughts and ideas directly to the White House. https://t.co/8joghPEq4E Let this sink in: The U.S. will spend TWENTY billion in the next ten years to help already wealthy people buy electric vehicles, but the left is shutting down the government over commonsense investments in border security. https://t.co/8ZGZXFgixV Merry Christmas to you and your family! May the joys of life, family, and God‚Äôs blessings fill your heart on this wonderful day. Every day that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put partisan politics above national security I will be giving up pay. It‚Äôs ridiculous that politicians can fund themselves but not fund border security. The Student Empowerment Act will expand 529 accounts to help families save for K-12 expenses while offering this benefit to homeschool families for the first time. I‚Äôm proud to work with @SenTedCruz to help families afford everyday education expenses and uphold individual liberty.

https://t.co/cfWeyeshCV The president and the people‚Äôs House have spoken - It‚Äôs time to responsibly fund border security. 

We can spend $700 billion to bail out Wall Street but Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi can‚Äôt come to the table on national security? With small business optimism at historic highs and more jobs available than people looking for work, America is open for business. üá∫üá∏ One year ago today Congress sent the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to President Trump‚Äôs desk. This week unemployment in Missouri reached the lowest level ever recorded, and we‚Äôve seen similar headlines all over the country. 1/2

https://t.co/4cdUN5PDSR This week I introduced the Fairness for Every Driver Act to end this wasteful tax subsidy and to make sure rural America isn't footing the bill for the electric vehicles the wealthy can already afford without a government handout.

https://t.co/peFD7je5Gd With grit, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, American workers do what it takes to get the job done. To everyone who helps keep America thriving by feeding the world and manufacturing the most innovative products - Happy #LaborDay! Last year I brought Chairman Pai to rural Missouri and hosted a roundtable on expanding broadband to rural America. He just announced Missouri will receive $255 million in broadband investments, more than any other state. Big news for rural Missouri homes and businesses: @AjitPaiFCC just announced 95,000 houses and farms in Missouri stand to gain access to high-speed internet for the first time.

https://t.co/tv7IQloQK2 It may be in hot in Poplar Bluff today, but fall is just around the corner. At Dunlap Pumpkin Farm right off of Highway AA families can visit the petting zoo, hay maze, unique games, and of course lots of pumpkins and squash! https://t.co/YJwj3RWsiK I was thrilled to help welcome Palindromes Inc. to Missouri. They're establishing a soybean crushing and processing facility in Pemiscot County and opening a new corporate headquarters in Columbia. It's a $62 million investment in the Show-Me State offering 93 new jobs. https://t.co/dUKqJ2VsPj Three generations of Moore family farmers showed me every step of their operation and talked to me about how we can strengthen the workforce in the agriculture industry. Commonsense work requirements for government aid would be a great step. https://t.co/LDLllPS79j Southern Missouri's farmers grow it all, even watermelons! https://t.co/CwtwjVqxw1 I want to know what priorities you want Congress to focus on. Do you have a second to share with me what is most important to you? 
üëâ https://t.co/iUbMu9Bwz6 https://t.co/eWolXYmWOk Thanks for the great discussion on the 2018 Farm Bill and how to best support family farmers in Missouri. 90% of farms in Missouri are family-owned, like the Pyles family farm in Centerville. Farming is a full time job for Joyce, who runs the farm and also works at the University of Missouri Extension, helping local farmers make the most of their land. https://t.co/TcSGUUYAWq Keep up with my work by signing up here: 

https://t.co/4U9388EWsj In my latest newsletter: I speak with local family farmers who grow and drive Missouri's economy, and books from the Library of Congress find new homes in Crawford County libraries.

https://t.co/L2D0vQq4cj The agriculture industry is Missouri's top employer, and local farmers and ranchers here know better than career bureaucrats who have never stepped foot on a farm in Missouri. Had a great discussion with Elizabeth Cureton at the Cureton Livestock Market on how to get Washington out of Missouri's way. 

https://t.co/g6Xtsm9ysy Josh Morris, who taught at Army Ranger School, now teaches environmental science at Drury University and raises registered Boer goats. He believes an understanding of agriculture helps children grow into responsible adults, and I couldn't agree more!

https://t.co/SdcuVK8Dd5 I was thrilled to speak to Valley High's new FFA chapter, an organization that did so much for me growing up. The district partnered with community leaders to create an amazing opportunity - an FFA farm next to the school where any student can learn about agriculture firsthand. https://t.co/5DVtso1QZs The Burke family in Mississippi County showed me how the latest technology used on family farms today saves precious time and resources. Farming is tough work with volatile markets, every little bit makes a big difference! https://t.co/JrYOWhJ5H8 During our stop to these young farmers' corn and soybean fields, a pretty large storm rolled in. We were drenched but didn't mind - we know how many farmers in southern Missouri were praying for rain! https://t.co/fArahoAy0J Right next to the Woodland School in Marble Hill is an artesian well where community members can get a fresh drink of water, courtesy of the Upchurch family. https://t.co/z3MDMIg4yn @Nuts__Baseball Sign up here to keep up to date with my work for Missouri's families ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/4U9388nlAL In my newsletter this week: Information about the Congressional Award, Charleston @Nuts__Baseball wins the Senior Babe Ruth World Series Title, and I speak to Valley High School's new FFA chapter ‚¨áÔ∏è

https://t.co/jsXQZXTrwQ It was great to see so many people come out for the @MoStateFair - the place was packed! https://t.co/Bnfy4GvjIo Thanks to #TaxReform they're investing in new training and facilities while increasing production substantially. If your food from the store has a smoky taste, there's a good chance it has the flavor of southern Missouri. The good folks at Kerry in Greenville use Missouri sawdust to create the smoky flavor in lunch meats, BBQ sauces, hot dogs, and even pet food. https://t.co/1iFWTYOsIW Three generations of Cluck family farmers shared with us their thoughts on the agriculture industry past and present and how they've adapted to the land in Missouri. https://t.co/QaDzkdaOaq I'm glad Shannon County Presiding Commissioner Jeff Cowan could join me at our agriculture summit at Cluck Ranch in Mountain View. ‚¨áÔ∏è

https://t.co/ewSdBkYSGY But in reality, it causes uncertainty and headaches for businesses trying to keep up. I appreciate the employees of Ozark Meats Butcher Shop showing me around the business and discussing ways the government can make it easier to do business in America, not harder. https://t.co/2VPRdg2e8F "It seems like they keep adding and changing rules as they go along, which makes everything more difficult. It's a lot to keep up with."

I see it every day in Washington - unelected bureaucrats think they're changing the world by constantly writing new regulations. https://t.co/9LBWI0bxHQ Sign up here: https://t.co/BOQdwPJNuV In my newsletter this week: Missouri celebrates 197 years of statehood, the tax cuts help a company in West Plains expand, and your chance to tell me what issues you think Congress should focus on. 

https://t.co/71fYwTG3Nu Today in 1821 Missouri joined the union and became the 24th state. Happy 197th birthday to the Show Me State! https://t.co/D0SFg2Y2uh @realDonaldTrump I appreciate Jeff Barber of Ozark Machinery Company showing me the new investments they're making in West Plains because of #TaxReform. https://t.co/zsRD5v6dq9 The economy is roaring because #TaxReform allows small businesses to fully expense the investments they make. It's what @realDonaldTrump and I knew would happen when hardworking Americans' money grows their communities and local businesses, not costly Washington programs. It was great to meet Wilbur and his family at Spreutels Red Angus and discuss the global beef markets together. https://t.co/OPyZraPw2z Wilbur Spreutels has three decades of experience raising cattle, and his family farm in Oregon County has won a dozen Grid Master Awards from the Red Angus Association of America for excellence in commercial cattle. https://t.co/Dd8QxhgUMU 236 years ago General Washington established the Badge of Military Merit, now called the Purple Heart Medal. On #PurpleHeartDay we recognize all who have been wounded or killed defending our country. To every person who has sacrificed for the United States of America - Thank you. https://t.co/OKRwcRpoLt Sign up here ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/BOQdwPJNuV In my newsletter this week: my thoughts on freedom of faith, I speak with local young farmers in Jackson, and Dale Moreland takes me for a ride on his Missouri State Fair champion mule ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/kU8r4lI8R1 These feral hogs are nothing but pests to local farmers and make farming more difficult than it already is. They serve no good purpose and I support total eradication.

Many thanks to Larry Campbell for showing me the damage these hogs cause and how hard it on farm equipment. https://t.co/eGuJbYla2h I appreciate Paul and Linda Klossner taking the time to host us and allowing me to inspect the erosion firsthand. https://t.co/MMehHx4WV5 Local farmers and public officials joined me at Rolling Thunder Ranch to survey erosion on the Big River bank. It's robbing Jefferson County farmers acres of land and causing floods to be more severe. https://t.co/keJCoYM7Jb This year they sent 11 riders and 10 horses to a national competition in Oklahoma. They're learning from the best - Kristi was the first woman to win the Missouri State Horse Proficiency Award. https://t.co/yan8E7luWC Kristi and Denny Herbst really do have a little piece of heaven in St. Francois County. Herbst Farms is home to beautiful Arabian horses and a 101 year old Avery tractor - that still runs! https://t.co/jbJTtMKiyX It's not every day you get to drive a mule, let alone a Missouri State Fair Champion! I appreciate Dale and Carol Moreland sharing with me what sets Moreland's Mules apart and taking me for a ride on their mules Tom and Jerry. https://t.co/i1Y3D8ilPf No wonder they were the winners of the 2017 @BEEFMagazine Stocker Award! 

https://t.co/u0zw67ooDI Steinbecker Livestock has quite the operation in Perryville. They were kind enough to show me around their cattle farm to see how they're making the most of the land with cover crops and using the latest technology to keep the family farm as efficient as possible. https://t.co/GgstxHJ5Cq
