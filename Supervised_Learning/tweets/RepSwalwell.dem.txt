https://t.co/h7TbVvXl5J As horrifying as so much of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs words were at the #SOTU, imagine if @SpeakerPelosi wasn‚Äôt sitting behind him. I‚Äôm not going to let hateful rhetoric get me down. America gave us a new Congress and a chance to save America. Onward! We want smart, effective border security: better staffing/tech at ports of entry &amp; elsewhere, more immigration judges, better monitoring of mail &amp; cargo, and humanitarian treatment of migrants &amp; refugees. NOT a costly, ineffective, ego-project wall. #SOTU FACTS:
Border crossings are far below historic highs.
Most undocumented immigrants overstay their visas.
Experts see no security crisis at the border.
Most drugs come via ports of entry.
Immigrants are less likely to commit crime than native-born Americans.
#NoWall #SOTU Once again, I‚Äôm disgusted by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs demonization of immigrants. When will this infantile stereotyping, scapegoating, and gaslighting end? #SOTU What a miss. With a gallery of many gun violence survivors @realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt say a single word about stopping the most dangerous people from getting the most dangerous weapons. Well @HouseDemocrats will. In less than 12 hours we have a hearing on background checks. #SOTU And @realDonaldTrump could improve #healthcare by halting his constant efforts to sabotage a law that insured more Americans than ever before. No American should go broke due to illness or injury. We need #MedicareForAll. #SOTU But @realDonaldTrump could improve #healthcare by halting his court battle to strike down protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. #SOTU I support bringing down prescription drug prices. I support going all-in to put an end to AIDS, cancer, and other diseases. We can work together on this. #SOTU About 40% of U.S. adults can‚Äôt cover a $400 unexpected expense with cash. 25% have no retirement savings; of those who do, less than 40% think they‚Äôre on track to have enough in their golden years. We need an economy that lifts them. #SOTU Now, on to what he did say: If @realDonaldTrump thinks we‚Äôll make investigations of his potential misdeeds &amp; betrayals into a bargaining chip to trade for legislation, he‚Äôs sadly mistaken. We‚Äôll walk and chew gun at the same time to protect our nation. #SOTU Also no mention of #climatechange's clear and present danger to our national security and economy . #SOTU #WellAlwaysHaveParis First, what we *didn‚Äôt* hear: Lots of #gunviolence survivors &amp; families present, incl. my guest @cameron_kasky, but @realDonaldTrump was mute on background checks, assault weapons, etc. He won‚Äôt be able to ignore us much longer. #SOTU2EndGunViolence #SOTU Lots of thoughts on today‚Äôs #SOTU.

Just posted my views on @Facebook Live: https://t.co/Ozu1AJ9m5O The #StateOfTheUnion is 3 wks away. I‚Äôd like to hear the President tell us how he‚Äôs going to give every kid, on every block, a shot at the American dream. What will the President do to invest in schools, provide skills for meaningful jobs, &amp; deliver a health care guarantee? You? Perhaps he‚Äôs just that awful.

My favorite part of the conservative outrage responses to this tweet is the ‚Äúbut the Berlin Wall was to keep people in‚Äù argument. Missing ENTIRELY that a wall is a wall no matter what side of it you are on. It‚Äôs medieval. It‚Äôs a symbol of ‚Äúus and not us.‚Äù And that is not U.S. Independent redistricting worked in CA.
