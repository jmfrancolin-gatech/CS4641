These types of grants have historically gone to higher population areas of the country. I am glad that the Trump Administration is working to fund these important projects in more rural areas, such as Wyoming. Thank you @SecElaineChao. The WYDOT project will add about 5.5 miles of passing lanes and 2 truck parking areas, along with dedicated short-range communication roadside radios. Good news! Wyoming will be receiving a $20 million grant from the Dept. of Transportation to help fund a project along I-80 between Walcott Junction and Quealy Dome Road. It has been 77 years since that #DayOfInfamy. Today we take time to honor the heroes who fought and died at #PearlHarbor along with all those who served in WWII. https://t.co/GwIqOPwarz The Natural Resources Conservation Service said that if funding was not provided now, it would likely cost significantly more, at least $2.6 million, to fix additional damage that would occur later. The area was initially deemed ineligible for funding, but the Wyoming delegation sent a letter last month urging the funding request to be reviewed.

I am troubled that after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, FEMA reportedly provided $3 billion in housing assistance, but more than 60 percent was used to pay contractors’ overhead and markups rather than actual home repairs.

I applaud @realDonaldTrump for signing an executive order today to strengthen retirement security options for small businesses and employers. https://t.co/Tx8NdejLMC It is unfortunate that activist litigation has once again delayed the process of allowing states to properly manage their own wildlife. https://t.co/krfpbHATyB Federal judge should not halt grizzly bear hunts in Wyoming. https://t.co/krfpbHATyB Today we gathered in the U.S. Capitol to honor Senator John McCain. He served his country. He served it well. America will never forget that service. Full statement here - https://t.co/QNMCzBPhMw Our local papers play a vital role in the state and shouldn’t have to struggle to survive because of these tariffs that were being pushed by one company. It is a relief that the U.S. International Trade Commission has ended tariffs on imports from Canada that were hurting our newspapers in Wyoming and the communities they serve. https://t.co/VSyJtUqV10 His dedication to his country and its defense was unmatched. He was passionate throughout his long years of service to the people of Arizona. Diana and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife Cindy and the entire McCain family as we mourn the passing of an American hero. Senator John McCain was a true patriot who dedicated his life to serving his country, his constituents and his family with honor. He rightfully earned his maverick moniker with his iron strength of will to stand up and fight for what he believed was right. Joined @SenTedCruz this week in urging @USTreasury to cut the Iranian regime off from the global banking system. https://t.co/3MKWKgE52E Financial literacy can be the key to help Americans save for retirement. Held a roundtable on the issue today with expertise witnesses, including U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza. More here: https://t.co/fzA7UwB1xh https://t.co/2UQmKhOP1y The lack of retirement planning by Americans at all stages of life illustrates the need to explore the financial literacy resources already available to help them. Learn more here: https://t.co/fzA7UwB1xh According to one employee survey nearly half of baby boomers had $100,000 or less set aside for retirement. That would likely mean only $4,000 in annual cash flow per year for retirement. I held a roundtable today with expert witnesses to explore what efforts are being made by the government and private sector to ensure people have the financial literacy they need to save for retirement. https://t.co/hmPHAWX8Ne RT @SenAlexander: Thanks to @SenatorEnzi for holding an important HELP subcommittee hearing at 2:30 PM EDT on financial literacy and saving… Chairing a hearing today at 2:30 p.m. EST on the state of financial literacy &amp; retirement security. Will have great witnesses to talk about best practices for promoting financial literacy that might help those Americans looking to save for their future. https://t.co/jPnefiepOW The Trump Administration’s efforts to replace the Clean Power Plan would help provide flexibility to the coal industry in Wyoming that suffered under severe restrictions. https://t.co/8dgmcGVed4 The Clean Power Plan clearly overstepped the EPA’s legal bounds and directly attacked America’s coal industry. I look forward to reviewing the proposed American Clean Energy (ACE) rule and discussing its impact with folks in Wyoming. I am glad the Trump Administration is working to provide flexibility for states, the energy industry and the entire nation by replacing the overly burdensome Clean Power Plan. https://t.co/8dgmcGDDlw This is about our states’ right to manage one of their most precious resources. I will continue to fight to finally end this disastrous rule. The Obama-era Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule was a massive regulatory overreach by the EPA that should have never been allowed in the first place. It is disappointing that a federal judge reinstated WOTUS in some states. https://t.co/89i4cPl7at RT @FoxBusiness: .@SenatorEnzi on new bill that will hold IRS employees accountable: "We had people that were rehired after misconduct or p… It was great to be on @AfterTheBell this afternoon to discuss the need for more accountability at the IRS and my op-ed published  w/ @SenatorBurr discussing our legislation that would do just that. -&gt; https://t.co/ESnKHEYpWp https://t.co/YzTT6E54iw My statement applauding Wyoming leaders for opposing the Bank of the West’s anti-fossil fuel policies. https://t.co/4PfoJznejS “Let's set some real consequences for bad behavior at the IRS” - My op-ed today with @SenatorBurr. https://t.co/R9VW8LyY0G I have an op-ed out today with @SenatorBurr about why and how Congress can bring accountability to an agency that has a history of serious misconduct. https://t.co/R9VW8LyY0G The IRS keeps rehiring employees with a history of misconduct and performance issues. If kids can learn that bad behavior has consequences, why can’t the IRS? Congratulations to Wind River’s Quincie Somervold for being named Wyoming’s champion in a Microsoft Office competition! What a great example of Wind River Job Corps students preparing for successful careers and futures. https://t.co/DVqfHov0sL It also includes my legislation w/ @SenatorCardin that would speed up payments to small contractors doing business with the Department of Defense. Congress passed a unified defense policy bill yesterday that would strengthen the military and authorize funding for programs and activities vital to Wyoming’s National Guard and F.E. Warren Air Force Base. Looking to travel abroad?

I'm glad I was able to participate last weekend. https://t.co/bDCKlW0Tip Great to be with @realDonaldTrump and others today for the signing of the bipartisan #PerkinsCTE reauthorization bill. This is the product of years of work and will help students obtain the skills they need to get good jobs in the future. https://t.co/RH9XAK5566 RT @SenateGOP: Today, @POTUS signed #PerkinsCTE into law. This legislation, which was championed by @SenatorEnzi, @SenAlexander, @IvankaTru… Very excited that @POTUS signed our bipartisan legislation into law today that will help students gain skills through career and technical education so they can find high-paying and in-demand jobs. https://t.co/Jsh15da4Oh Today the president signed a bill into law that I have been working on for years that will help students and workers get the skills they need to find high-skill, high-wage or in-demand jobs. #PerkinsCTE https://t.co/Jsh15drGcR I am proud of this bill and the bipartisan, and almost unanimous, support it has received. That does not happen without a tremendous amount of work to get it to that point. Proud to be at the White House for the signing of the #PerkinsCTE reauthorization into law by @RealDonaldTrump. Thanks to @SenBobCasey, @SenAlexander, @PattyMurray &amp; @IvankaTrump for their help in getting this bill across the finish line. https://t.co/Jsh15drGcR When a court ruled that a WWI memorial should be torn down, I believe it misinterpreted the Constitution. I joined @SenTedCruz and 107 other members of Congress in asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision.  https://t.co/YBbg2VzAfK I signed onto an amicus brief with 108 other members of Congress to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a court decision to tear down a World War I memorial. Tearing down the Bladensburg Peace Cross could imperil war memorials all across the country.  https://t.co/YBbg2VzAfK As the resolution states, the cowboy archetype embodies honesty, integrity, courage, compassion, respect, a strong work ethic and patriotism while transcending ethnicity, gender, geographic boundaries and political affiliations. Happy National Day of the American Cowboy! I am proud to be a sponsor of this Senate resolution. Started in 2005 by Wyoming’s own U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, this day traditionally coincides each year with Cheyenne Frontier Days. https://t.co/RNLuF9dnZq
