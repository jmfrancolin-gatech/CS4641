This bipartisan bill is just one of many steps I‚Äôm taking to protect our communities. (4/4) We must close loopholes in our background check system so that people cannot purchase a firearm unless they clear a background check. This will not restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens, it will prevent those seeking to harm others from accessing firearms. (3/4) Since I took office in 2017, our state and nation have experienced many tragedies involving firearms. I‚Äôve spoken with countless people in our community and we all agree - it‚Äôs time to act. (2/4) It‚Äôs time for common sense laws to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and those who are a danger to themselves and others. Today I joined Parkland survivors and my colleagues who are committed to keeping our communities safe.
