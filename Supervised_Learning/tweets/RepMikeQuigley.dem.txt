We must prevent another #TrumpShutdown. Fewer #IRS employees impacts taxpayers &amp; tax professionals preparing for the 2019 filing season, resulting in delayed returns, difficulty obtaining loans, paused audits/exams, &amp; unanswered questions for families. That's why I intro'd leg to reopen the IRS during #TrumpShutdown.

This will help in the cultivation of learning gardens, farm-to-table education, farmers markets at schools &amp; gardening jobs for high school students. #BeASeedOfChange Since 2015, the International Basic #Education Caucus has encouraged our Members and our colleagues throughout Congress to invest in education in the developing world, improving the quality of life and economic security of the most vulnerable.

The President of the United States is willing to put thousands of lives at risk in the face of REAL natural disasters in order to support a border wall for an imagined, manufactured crisis. https://t.co/2Vt2ndcHF2 Tune in tonight at 7pm ET... https://t.co/Gfdl26TSpv A grave, disheartening reminder that homophobia &amp; transphobia still run rampant, incl. in our schools. Students should feel safe &amp; supported, not demonized &amp; ostracized. It's on all of us to continue stepping up as #LGBTQ allies &amp; examples of acceptance. https://t.co/DuFPuKHX9h Did you know: #TrumpShutdown unconscionably forces air traffic controllers, along with #TSA agents &amp; other crucial safety officials, to work long hours without pay? Time to stop treating these workers like pawns in a political chess match and pass today's bill to reopen @USDOT. https://t.co/YLfKEIsmWj RT @AppropsDems: .@RepMikeQuigley: This #TrumpShutdown is endangering the well-being of the American public.

See how security &amp; efficiency in our airports are gravely compromised due to the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/vbtfMPyF20 The preventable #TrumpShutdown poses a direct threat to our physical safety. After the extreme weather we've seen in recent years, we must heed the advice of @NWSNHC experts, who say they cannot properly prepare for #hurricane season. The clock is ticking. https://t.co/brQboxp0N1 RT @lynnsweet: Democrats move a heading w piecemeal bills to reopen government- @RepMikeQuigley Chairman-Designate the Financial Services a… 19 days of uncertainty &amp; counting, this bill reopens a number of vital agencies that the American people rely upon every single day. Proud of my Democratic colleagues, and the 8 Republican Members who joined us, for voting to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/qRlbQ6UeE1 We can &amp; must put a stop to this chaos that is rattling our communities and disrupting our economy. By passing my Financial Services #Appropriations bill, we will be able to get more than 130,000 workers back to work and receiving a paycheck! #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/pU3EtUTi7Q My bill—which is virtually identical to the Senate-passed legislation—rejects cuts to @SBAgov, blocks Trump from doling out lavish raises to the VP, &amp; includes back pay for federal employees furloughed during #TrumpShutdown. Learn more via @AppropsDems: https://t.co/0qlJ6lbOie Consumer Protection Watchdog Shuttered: Most services provided by the FTC are suspended under #TrumpShutdown, including the National Do Not Call Registry, consumer complaint systems &amp; identity theft reporting—as well as law enforcement access to FTC’s consumer complaints. Securities Industry Regulator Closed: Nearly all SEC employees are furloughed, limiting the agency’s activities to process and approve filings. A prolonged #TrumpShutdown will require companies to delay mergers, IPOs, and other actions, hindering economic activity. Support for Small Businesses Stopped: During the #TrumpShutdown, @SBAgov has completely halted its role in the federal contracting process, interfering with projects government wide, and has stopped approving loan assistance. IRS Customer Service Halted: All taxpayer customer service, including walk-in taxpayer assistance centers, which together serve approximately 2.5 million citizens monthly, is unavailable during the #TrumpShutdown. Because of the #TrumpShutdown, some of the most important activities funded in the Financial Services and General Government bill have ground to a halt. In addition to tax return processing, the shutdown has also led to other serious impacts... THREAD—As the Chairman-designate of the Financial Services Subcommittee on @AppropsDems, I’ve seen how the #TrumpShutdown is creating chaos in our communities &amp; economy. 

That’s why I introduced legislation to reopen key agencies &amp; alleviate the impacts on families &amp; businesses. Out of touch &amp; out of his mind. What a cruel thing to say to the hundreds of thousands of families his temper tantrum has impacted. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/qLBAKf3Wbg RT @AppropsDems: After 19 days of the #TrumpShutdown, the American people are ready for us to reopen the government, restore vital services… Proud to once again cosponsor the #BanToxicPesticides Act to prohibit the sale &amp; use of dangerous pesticide chlorpyrifos.

From creating jobs to launching innovative services, we appreciate the invaluable role #immigrants play in #IL communities. https://t.co/pI9ivMJDM1 Last night, my #IL05 staff attend the #LGBTQ storytelling session, OUTspoken! Learn more about this monthly event that fosters community &amp; helps individuals share their experiences: https://t.co/VmG8jbW1pz https://t.co/IvsoKBqMLX The only crisis here is the one the president himself created by shutting down our government. Absolutely despicable—but not surprising—that he used a prime time platform to spread even more lies, a continuation of what we’ve seen for the past four years. Check the facts ⬇️ https://t.co/bVv5r9tgyP Great to join @evachicago again for their monthly meeting! I always appreciate the opportunity to talk with #IL05 families about the community challenges &amp; national issues that impact them most. https://t.co/W8WFmKTODD 97% of Americans support commonsense #backgroundcheck laws, but these measures have been held up in Congress for years due to Republican obstruction.

Carson must address HUD's failure to extend these contracts that provide safe, affordable housing for many struggling to get by https://t.co/JGYedKVamb Completely dismayed &amp; alarmed by news that +1,000 #housing contracts were carelessly allowed to expire by HUD on January 1st—It's simply unconscionable that thousands of extremely low-income Americans now face possible eviction b/c of the incompetence of the Trump Administration. https://t.co/fNmodbVKFg .@realDonaldTrump, exactly what kind of “adjustments” do you expect these impacted workers to make?

Stop paying for child care? Miss their rent due date? Go hungry? 

Don’t ever tell these Americans, who rely on their paycheck, that you can “relate.” https://t.co/714teDkg3c The 800,000 federal workers hanging in limbo aren't enough to encourage @senatemajldr to govern responsibly, but I hope his Republican colleagues convince him to resolve the #TrumpShutdown immediately &amp; restore peace of mind to those we serve in Congress. https://t.co/AKTvylYSvS RT @BettyMcCollum04: Thousands of federal employees are going w/o pay during the #TrumpShutdown, and the president is doling out pay raises… #Chicago farmers markets don’t quit when winter rolls around! Great to join my friends from @GreenCityMarket this morning. https://t.co/ddVHH6vGIX It’s outrageous that those in the White House believe they can hold themselves to such a different standard. Their disconnect with the American people is truly staggering. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/2jcAQc2VcK With +800k federal employees left stranded w/o pay, it's shameful that the WH would even consider using the #TrumpShutdown as its own personal payday. An ego-driven failure to lead is not an opportunity to dole out raises for the VP &amp; POTUS' inner circle. https://t.co/4TzWR5HPtg As Chairman-designate of the Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing the Exec. Office of the President, I strongly urge the WH to back off its despicable attempt to line its own pockets as the American people suffer from—and are distracted by—a shutdown of Trump's own making. https://t.co/RHVsRN9Ye5 Once we give Americans a seat at the table, we'll be better suited to tackle our most pressing problems.

Funding the government is one of the most important duties of Congress, and I was pleased to vote with my colleagues to end #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/DKdc9QduaN My message to Republicans: Stop covering for the President as he doubles down on his reckless mistake, pass these Senate-supported bills, and provide Americans with the certainty they deserve. 

Catch my floor remarks on the #TrumpShutdown here: https://t.co/I7DaL8nrty https://t.co/2jnW6seexV What does the GOP have to show for the #TrumpShutdown? +800k federal employees left wondering when their next paycheck is going to arrive; financial markets rattled by a POTUS willing to throw the economy into chaos over pride; &amp; American families deprived of vital gov services.
