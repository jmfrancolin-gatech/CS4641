This nation has lost one of the great legislators of our time.  Rep. John Dingell was a man who did not hesitate to stand up, speak up and speak out for those who were left out and left behind. He will be deeply missed. https://t.co/CfpGqsVRvw Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was my hero, my mentor, my friend, and my brother. We honor his legacy by celebrating this holiday as a day on, not a day off. It is a day of action, a day of love, to give of ourselves to others and begin anew the building of the beloved community. Thank you, @Delta! https://t.co/ne7y8PdQlA Wishing everyone a happy and safe Christmas holiday. Every minute, every day, every week of delay is a disservice to American taxpayers.  This is good work -- necessary work -- and it puts the people before politics.

Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year—it is the struggle of a lifetime. Be persistent and consistent. We shall overcome. #GoodTrouble VOTE! Do your part. Honor the sacrifice of those who marched and protested, those who were beaten and left bloody, those who gave the last full measure of devotion so that each and every one of us can exercise our right to vote. You can change America. #goodtrouble Never give up, never give in, never give out. Keep the faith and keep your eyes on the prize. Each and every vote matters. Do your part and vote like you’ve never voted before. Believe in the power of love and together we will build the Beloved Community here in America. During another period people waited in immovable lines, faced billy clubs and cattle prods, in order to register and vote. Have courage, raw courage, and let nothing stop you from exercising your right to vote in this election. Do your part. Vote. #GoodTrouble Sometimes you have to let the spirit move you. https://t.co/4n4YMpOjVL Be bold. Be courageous. Vote like you’ve never voted before. Together we can redeem the soul of America. #GoodTrouble There is no room in our society for gun violence and especially not in a place of worship. Elected officials must stop fanning the flames of hatred, bitterness, and division. We must condemn these terrible acts in the strongest possible terms and work to heal these deep wounds. I am grateful to local, state, and federal law enforcement as well as the U. S. Postal Service for their efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the attempted mail bombings. Hate is too heavy a burden to bear. Love is the better way. The right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a democratic society. Let nothing stand in your way to use it so that together we may build a truly more perfect union here in America. #vote #GoodTrouble I fought too long and too hard to end discrimination based on race not to stand up and speak out against discrimination based on gender identity. We are all human beings blessed with the spark of the divine.  #WontBeErased https://t.co/xBSXxPLNBR I have been beaten, my skull fractured, and arrested more than forty times so that each and every person has the right to register and vote.

https://t.co/7MoXgOzDyP It's hard not to see parallels to the Civil Rights Movement when reporters were threatened, beaten, &amp; attacked for attempting to shine a light on injustices perpetrated in the Deep South. The administration’s weak &amp; feeble response demonstrates whose side they really fight for. Greed and power can never be allowed to conspire to extinguish a human life. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is a vicious attack on the press, on free speech, and basic human rights. I am sick and outraged over the murder of journalist and American permanent resident Jamal Khashoggi. The President and his administration have failed to uphold their duty to the Constitution and to the rule of law by turning a blind-eye to this demonic act. The right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a democratic society. 

Do your part. 

Get registered. Vote. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay I applaud Mayor Bottoms’ decision to end the City of Atlanta’s contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). https://t.co/k7TRY3LRjS 55 years ago today, we marched on Washington for jobs and freedom.

He will be deeply missed by people all around the world. We have lost one of the great artists of our time. Aretha Franklin was one of God’s precious gifts to the world—one of God’s shining jewels. She is deeply loved by millions of people as the Queen of Soul. Her voice is still a guiding light to vocalists today. 53 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson. I shed a little blood on that bridge in Selma and friends of mine gave their lives so that no person would be denied their right to vote. Now do your part—get registered, and vote. #goodtrouble https://t.co/wgKUs37JAG Happy Birthday, @BarackObama #goodtrouble https://t.co/yx7y5Y9bmd Congratulations @mitchellreports on 40 years of doing the hard, necessary work of keeping the American people informed.

As a nation and as a people we can do much better. We may have to turn America upside down to turn it right-side up. #KeepFamiliesTogether The right to vote is precious, almost sacred.

Find a way to get in the way and we will make a way out of no way. #goodtrouble There is no sound more powerful than the marching feet of a determined people. #goodtrouble Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble. #goodtrouble I never thought I would live to see a day when the Supreme Court of the United States would again make a decision as inhumane as Dred Scott v.

It is simply un-American. I will fight this action with every fiber of my being. https://t.co/jyrwTPOxHO As we face challenges and uncertainty around the globe, it makes no sense to turn your back to progress, to ignore the pleas of our allies, and to disregard wise counsel and hard core facts.  The price of peace is persistence, but the cost of war is always too high. To this very day, experts and allies agree that the agreement was working to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran cannot have nuclear weapons—but the United States must be a headlight and not a taillight, leading the world on the path to peace through the hard, necessary work of diplomacy. Nearly 3 years ago, I supported the agreement after constant study, briefings, and discussions. During the debate on the House Floor, I warned that we could not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in the quest for nonviolence, especially when the alternative is nonexistence. Never before has the credibility of the United States been so undermined by a gross failure to honor our commitments. It is a sad and dark hour for our nation and the global family.  This administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a major blow to all those working to bring peace to the world community. I believe we have a right to know what is in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. On this #EarthDay, we must resolve to do all that we can to leave this planet we call Earth a little cleaner and a little greener for generations yet unborn. #goodtrouble To the young people speaking up and speaking out today, my heart is with you. Keep walking and keep marching all the way to the polls in November. You will change America. #NationalSchoolWalkout I was saddened by the passing of Rev. F.D. Reese. I first met Rev.

The frantic, desperate release of this memo leads us down a dangerous path of political spin and accusations instead of thoughtful, responsible, congressional oversight. I never thought that I would witness the dismantling of the checks and balances of our country, and I never imagined that Republicans would cast aside the national security interests of our nation. This is a dark hour and a sad day in the history of our nation.  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to protect the goodwill of the United States and to serve as an inspiration to the global community for whom the dream of democracy is a beacon of hope and light.

Yesterday taxpayers stood up and spoke out against Republicans lining the pocket of their donors by any means necessary. Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain? You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. This bill is a shame and a disgrace. I’ve said on many occasions that you cannot get blood from a turnip, and you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire Paul. I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to vote against this bill. Working and middle class families, the sick, the elderly, and generations yet unborn will bear the burden of this reckless act. I oppose this conference report with every bone in my body. This tax bill is a $2.3 trillion holiday gift for Wall Street, the rich, and the wealthy. Conceived in darkness and birthed with the help of donors and funders. This bill is not for the people.
