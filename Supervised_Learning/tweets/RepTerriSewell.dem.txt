Alice Coachman Davis was the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal! Davis had to overcome many disadvantages growing up under discriminatory Jim Crow laws, but persevered and captured high jump gold in 1948. 

#BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/yQoMG0fJhb My prayers are with the Dingell family today. Former Congressman John Dingell was a giant in the House. From passing Medicare to helping lead the fight for the Civil Rights Act, his lifetime of contributions will be enjoyed for decades to come. May he Rest In Peace. https://t.co/H1AvUD3ycr The Trump administration is siding with predatory payday lenders instead of with the American people. Payday lenders charge interest rates as high as 400%, trapping Americans in seemingly inescapable cycles of debt. Just shameful. https://t.co/g5a7A9ywb3 Calling all artists! 

Our annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students is open, and the deadline for submissions is approaching! Submit your work soon!

Find more details here: https://t.co/KNOV3dOqa7 https://t.co/irsHB9M5nJ Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I’m recognizing Chief Judge U.W. Clemon. He was of the first two black lawmakers elected to AL Senate since Reconstruction and Alabama’s first black federal judge. I was also lucky enough to serve as his law clerk before coming to Congress! https://t.co/mcwZulhbgz I introduced a bill with @RepRonKind to help protect our auto industry from the Trump administration’s reckless trade policy. The admin’s proposed 25% tariff on autos threatens the jobs of nearly 40,000 workers in Alabama. It’s bad for business and it’s bad for Alabama! https://t.co/5Ke71OZT9s @maejemison When she was a little girl, Dr. Jemison remembers telling her kindergarten teacher she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up. She is just one of many examples of what little girls can achieve when they are given the support they need to reach for the stars. https://t.co/qfAIG3YxXT Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I'm recognizing another #shero fro Alabama, Dr. @maejemison, the first woman of color to go to space! https://t.co/daHxlEPTOH Loved seeing Senators @dougjones and @chriscoons tonight at the #SOTU! https://t.co/u2BHqzv6BP Ladies in white! We are wearing white tonight in honor of the record number of women serving in the 116th Congress. Not only are there 127 current female members of Congress, the members of the 116th make up the most diverse congressional class in history. https://t.co/bb1h6oM5pK I'm honored that Mrs. Tiphanie Carter is representing the 7th District at the #SOTU tonight. I hope the President focuses not on what divides us, but on what unites us as Americans! https://t.co/kAd2YpT8hy Honored to have Mrs. Tiphanie Carter to represent Alabama’s 7th District at the State of the Union! Her presence is a reminder of the dignity &amp; sacrifices of our law enforcement families and the need to end senseless gun violence. Thank you! #SOTU https://t.co/SLw60EAluY “Hammerin’ Hank” @HenryLouisAaron turns 85 today! Happy Birthday! The Mobile native is one of the most celebrated athletes in American history. He broke Babe Ruth’s longstanding home run record 45 years ago this year. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/H1t0EK6zh3 Sen. @JaboWaggoner is right! We need to expand Medicaid in Alabama. Premiums and health care costs are higher in states that have not expanded. And over 90% of rural hospital closures have been in states that did not expand Medicaid before the closure. https://t.co/ZF0SPhIPbC Sgt. Carter's service truly represents the best of Alabama’s 7th District. I’m honored his wife Mrs. Tiphanie Carter will join me tomorrow at the #SOTU. My congressional colleagues need to hear her story and act to prevent the senseless gun violence afflicting our communities. This #SOTU I am honored to pay tribute to the bravery and sacrifices of our law enforcement officers. Sgt. Wytasha Carter was the kind of man that we all hope our sons grow up to be – a devoted and passionate father, husband, co-worker and member of the Birmingham community. https://t.co/A60ouAqCOI Happy 106th Birthday, Rosa Parks! 

Parks’ legacy reminds us that one small, bold action can cause great change. May we always summon her strength and courage as we continue to fight for justice. 

#BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/nf1wHmQneJ He famously said, “I don't know what the future may hold, but I know who holds the future,” a reminder that we all have a role to play in advancing justice and equality. Ralph Abernathy was one of Dr. Martin Luther King’s closest friends and advisors whose work was central to the Montgomery bus boycott and the civil rights movement. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/V3zBqHNaxA Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice was the first female African-American Secretary of State and the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor to the President.

#BlackHistoryMonth2019 https://t.co/RrdvGpe7Y4 Wonderful being in Montgomery this morning speaking with civil rights icons Doris Crenshaw and Lisa McNair, whose sister Denise was a victim of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing, about how we can continue to advance Civil Rights in Alabama and our nation. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/vziJTgSxFm Tonight I saw the most talented Montgomery Public School students in an amazing performance of “Four Little Girls”  @AlabamaShakes!

I’m proud the House voted today to give them a hard-earned 2.6% cost of living adjustment. https://t.co/MTVRRc5cmg If women and men do the same job, they should get the same pay. That’s why I support the #PaycheckFairness Act! https://t.co/9Z3r06DMtc Not only do over 1.1 million Alabamians rely on Social Security, but the program also lifted 437,878 Alabamans out of poverty in 2016. Social Security is sound policy and makes economic sense. That's why I’m proud to support #Secure2100 https://t.co/ZDzbFrdsjx .@StaceyAbrams reflects our party’s shared values of equality and inclusion and is a brilliant choice to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union! https://t.co/qmDEd38Ni7 It is always a pleasure meeting with our Alabama United @MineWorkers!

AL women working full time lose more than $11B a year due to the wage gap. 

It's time to ensure women get equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/VCZmXsIszG At our first Ways &amp; Means Committee hearing this Congress, we are focused on the importance of protecting health insurance coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

We are all brothers and sisters and must stand united in the fight against bigotry and inequality today and every day. To be clear, it is never a good idea to shutdown govt over policy disputes. The American people deserve better. I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to pass funding bills that reflect our shared values, respect our workers and invest in effective border security. For 35 days, Pres. Trump’s govt shutdown has caused undue financial hardships on thousands of federal workers while inflicting needless pain on all Americans. While I’m glad POTUS finally re-opened govt today, it is never a good idea to shutdown govt over policy disagreements. This indictment brings new info to light, namely that at the same time the President asked Russians to publish Clinton’s emails, a Trump campaign official was “directed” to contact Mr. Stone about additional damaging info released by Wikileaks. We must get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/EeP2nuFTzt It is about time! I’m glad the President is finally coming to his senses to #EndTheShutdownNow! https://t.co/mYisZgpGHb It’s unconscionable that Senate Republicans are playing party politics while the well being and financial security of our federal employees hangs in the balance. It’s past time to #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/RFtouI28bM Birmingham Mayor @randallwoodfin visited with me today! Thanks Mayor for hanging with my interns! @cityofbhamal https://t.co/UxYUJ0Jujb Secretary Ross, will you pay the interest on the payday loans that the working class often must turn to? As a billionaire, Sec. Ross clearly does not understand what it means to work paycheck to paycheck and the urgency of now. We need to #EndTheShutdown!

These words are as true today as they were in 2016: “Every day, you confront danger so it does not find our families, carry burdens so they do not fall to us, and courageously meet test after test to keep us safe.” In 2016, President @BarackObama wrote a beautiful letter to our Nation’s police officers that I find relevant as we mourn the loss of Birmingham Police Sergeant Wytasha Carter. Find the letter here: https://t.co/WM7VVsfBsb https://t.co/4VboaMIfl4 I am heartbroken this morning over the news that we’ve lost a Birmingham Police Sergeant who was killed while protecting our fellow citizens.

Shame on Trump for putting politics before the American people! #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/pfvjZCuu7b Today I am voted to reopen the National Parks including the Selma Interpretative Center! The Trump shutdown must end! POTUS-Too many hardworking federal employees need their pay and taxpayers deserve to have our national treasures OPEN #EndtheTrumpShutdown https://t.co/tFO1XX5ujO This is shameful. For every worker who has to dip into savings, darken the doors of a payday lender, or apply for unemployment, this is a dark day in this country and political games in Washington are to blame. #TrumpShutdown END No wall, no matter how high or wide, will help that American worker get their finances back on track or help them run from the cycle of debt they've been trapped in. Thanks #TrumpShutdown! The payday loan industry is having a field day with the #TrumpShutdown, taking advantage of people desperate for an infusion of cash to pay bills. We all know how that ends-endless cycles of debt for some, repossessed cars, financial ruin for others. https://t.co/7GAAw80URx A wall will not pay them for the hours the #TrumpShutdown has taken from them or feed their families or buy their medicine in the meantime. On top of missed paychecks for federal workers, there are also 1000s of hourly workers who work in the cafeterias or on the custodial staff at these agencies who will not get backpay. The #TrumpShutdown is leaving them even less economically secure. What many in Washington don’t understand is that the average American can’t miss a paycheck without dipping in to savings. And for far too many, there are no savings to dip into or parent to ask for money from. THREAD: From men and women of the Coast Guard working in Mobile, to National Park Service rangers in Selma to NASA workers and contractors in Huntsville, thousands of Alabama workers will go without paychecks today because of the #TrumpShutdown! A National Championship Caucus wouldn't be much fun for anyone except @RepJeffDuncan and me. Clemson wins the championship this year, but they still have 14 more to win before they match our record!

#CollegeFootballPlayoffs https://t.co/Ny0GP2hevW Tonight I joined the Langford family as they waited for Mayor Langford’s return. My prayers are with the whole family as they reunite. https://t.co/7QXIQFZTYY The holiday season is a reminder of the importance of family, and the commutation of Mayor Langford’s sentence means that our former Mayor can spend his final days at home in Alabama with loved ones. My prayers are with the whole Langford family as they reunite. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama Jay Town, Senator Doug Jones, our federal partners, and all those who worked side-by-side with our office despite the government shutdown to secure Mayor Langford’s release. As I have said before, justice should be fair, but merciful. I am deeply grateful to all those who heeded our renewed call for the immediate compassionate release of Mayor Larry Langford. I am calling on the Trump Administration to act with compassion in the case of Mayor Langford and immediately reduce his sentence. Justice should be fair but also merciful. Mayor Langford should spend his final days surrounded by family in Alabama. https://t.co/UVbHZIRJ1N Merry Christmas from my family to yours! https://t.co/z39rxMbHB3 This is a one-two punch for American taxpayers. First, we have to pay for the expense of a government shutdown, on top of that we’re being asked to pay for the expense of Trump’s pet project. Time for Republicans to come to their senses and work with Dems to reopen the government It is unconscionable that Trump would shut down the federal government to secure $5 billion for a wall that the American public does not want. This Republican Congress could not find funding for teacher pay, for access to health care, or for infrastructure investments! Unbelievable! 12:04am Government is SHUTDOWN! Irresponsible and Unacceptable! Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House and they simply can NOT Govern!!! All over a wall!!  Shame on you for the Trump Shutdown!! Big win!! Today, in a bipartisan vote, the House passed legislation which paves the way for the release of records pertaining to civil rights era cold cases. Thanks @SenDougJones for leading the way on this! We should NEVER give up on justice. Trump’s new food assistance requirements destroy another ladder out of poverty. We cannot become a nation that allows families to go hungry, or denies a hand up to those in need. As a country, we are better than that. Special thanks to my awesome staff Asia Brown and Myeisha Hutchinson for representing us at the 2018 Ramsay HS MIlitary Ball!  Asia did a great job as the the keynote speaker! Thanks to a great staff!!! Congrats Asia!! https://t.co/G4OiUH8nYh Last week's ACA ruling by an extreme right-wing judge would throw tens of millions of Americans off their health care. We cannot allow Republicans to eliminate health care protections and access for American families, including people with pre-existing conditions. Ryan Zinke's tenure as Interior Secretary was marked by the extravagant, wasteful use of taxpayer dollars. Our taxpayers deserve better. In the new Congress, Dems are making ethics reforms a top priority as part of our work to build a government of, by, and for the people! The Alabama Department of Labor will also be hosting emergency meetings with Virginia College students and employees.

Shutting down the government over funding for a wall that the public doesn't want is disgraceful. Plain and simple. Our democracy is stronger when ALL Americans can vote.

We can’t let racism come between us &amp; the lifesaving care that so many rural immigrant doctors are providing to us, our family, &amp;our neighbors! Without immigrant doctors &amp; nurses, our doctor shortages in rural areas would be even worse. As many rural Alabamians are painfully aware, the amount of doctors in our communities isn’t just a measure of privilege, it’s a matter of life and death.

Getting a flu shot can reduce your chances of having to go to the doctor with the flu by 40 to 60 percent. Protect your family by getting vaccinated! Flu shots are free with most health insurance. #flushot #vaccines #FactsMatter https://t.co/8XkAfurTTx Tomorrow and Tuesday, take advantage of FREE workshops on wastewater management - all attendees receive a voucher for pumping and inspection of their septic tanks! Thanks to the University of Alabama, UWA, and the Alabama Onsite Wastewater Association for teaming up to host this! https://t.co/h21zKyhBi1 In the Navy, the CIA, and in the Oval Office, President George H.W. Bush dedicated his life to serving. He was a true patriot who put his country first. Today my prayers are with the whole Bush family. There are still outstanding questions on whether this trade deal will benefit Alabama's farmers, auto workers, and consumers. Looking forward to reviewing the deal when it comes before the Ways and Means Committee in the new Congress. https://t.co/7i7Hng9ox6 Cervical cancer deaths are preventable with new vaccines and screenings, yet 4,200 women in the US will die from cervical cancer this year. In Alabama, women are dying at a higher rate than any other state. A new report highlights the tragic reality: https://t.co/kKiSfXVxd3 https://t.co/jT9PDcyuNO Thank you for the kind words @RepRaskin https://t.co/rVMHjsyXID Congratulations to @RepRaskin our new Caucus Leadership Representative!! Great race! I look forward to working with you! We only have about two weeks of #OpenEnrollment left!! If you or anyone you know still needs health insurance, you can find a full list of plans at https://t.co/FMBw0GURPF. https://t.co/wtgZvjiC8w There are modern day efforts to make it harder for folks to vote, and we as elected officials should be concerned when eligible Americans don't have access to the ballot box. https://t.co/3DwtKi0o3r Congratulations Rep. James @Clyburn, I'm excited for all the great work ahead! https://t.co/cqcbepuzH2 Here in Congress, I'm fighting to increase awareness around cervical cancer, strengthen access to screenings, and find solutions that help us fight cancer in our communities! https://t.co/4FhlOPTJMO Cervical cancer is one of the most treatable cancers, yet it claims more lives in the Black Belt than perhaps anywhere else in the country. Increasing access to preventative health screenings could dramatically reduce cancer diagnoses and cervical cancer related mortality rates. Congratulation to @RepJeffries our newly elected Democratic Caucus Chair! https://t.co/MONKyN9bI4 There were 710 foster children adopted during the 2018 fiscal year. It brings my heart joy to see so many children find permanent loving homes! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾https://t.co/N1JBzKwwdl Don't forget that the last day of #openenrollment is Dec 15th!! https://t.co/0TelKwcqN1 Tragedies like this one erode the public trust. Through accountability and transparency, it is my hope we can get to the truth of the events that transpired that evening and get justice for the victims. My heartfelt prayers are with E.J.’s family and all those injured and impacted by this tragic event. As a community, we must insist that ALEA, the Hoover Police Department and all law enforcement involved, conduct this investigation with the utmost transparency to the public. I join with the community in calling for justice for E.J. and the other victims. The senseless tragedy that led to the death of Emantic “E.J.” Bradford, Jr. must be thoroughly investigated and all the facts brought into the light. Today, I'm #thankful for trailblazers like Shirley Chisholm who paved the way for generations of women to be leaders in our democracy. Thanks to all the women who've stood up to discrimination and harassment and who've demanded their seat at the table. Your voice matters. https://t.co/Jy7dPlV8UB Happy #Thanksgiving from my family to yours. Wishing you a holiday filled with love and warmth! https://t.co/7l4LSKcJK2 Packed town hall tonight in Selma! Thank you to everyone who turned out to talk about the issues!! We've got work to do in the new Congress! https://t.co/b0CpGjjBBi RT @AriBerman: Voter suppression was a “nightmare” in 2018 says @RepTerriSewell, chief sponsor of bill restoring Voting Rights Act. “Our re… Tariffs on auto imports will hurt our workforce here in Alabama, plain and simple. I'm calling on the Trump Administration to reconsider before they drive jobs out of our state. https://t.co/p135RKu1sE This weekend, my office honored Hank Sanders as he retires from over 35 years of service as a State Senator representing Alabama's Black Belt. Sen. Sanders truly set the gold standard of servant leadership in Alabama. His public service will live on in the many lives he impacted. https://t.co/doh68Ofa1o RT @FedAmerHospital: Thank you @RepTerriSewell for recognizing the millions of Americans who rely on rural hospitals during Rural Hospital… A huge thank you to Sens. Shelby and Jones, Rep. Aderholt, USDA's Chris Beeker, and all of the state and local stakeholders who helped to make this investment possible. No American family should have to live without access to safe wastewater treatment in the 21st Century. BIG victory today for Alabama!! USDA has announced a $23.4 million grant to address failing wastewater infrastructure in Uniontown.  This is going to have a real-life impact for thousands of Alabamians living in the rural Black Belt. A full 60 percent of Alabama high school seniors qualify for a Pell Grant. I'm #Thankful4Pell because this program gives students a shot at pursuing their dreams and strengthens our workforce in the years ahead! https://t.co/L2XLHKABAn "I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant." - MLK Congratulations to the #BirminghamCivilRightsInstitute, celebrating its 26th Anniversary today! Thank you for your tireless commitment to sharing Alabama's impact on the Civil Rights Movement, an impact which ultimately changed the future of our nation! https://t.co/imXIPTnrm9 Join me on Monday, Nov. 19, at 5:30PM CT for a town hall at the Selma Interpretive Center!! As Democrats take control in the House, we need to focus on the big issues facing working families in our district. I want to hear your top legislative priorities for the new year! https://t.co/QO4UE6vyHI The state and federal government have got to work together to stop the bleeding! Access to quality health care is a right not a privilege! #Standup4RuralHospitals Nearly 60 million Americans live in rural communities across the country and many depend on rural hospitals for their care. Since 2010, Alabama has lost 5 rural hospitals, one of the highest rates of closures in the country. https://t.co/EDQTXcv0f5 Special thanks to @UNCF for honoring me for supporting HBCUs! So proud to represent the HBCUs in my district! @StillmanCollege @ASUHornetNation @MilesHomecoming https://t.co/C7zaZfA8CP No family should have to live with a contaminated backyard, and no community should be left to clean up decades of industrial waste. We must continue fighting for a full cleanup of North Birmingham until our whole community is made safe. The charges brought against Trey Glenn provide additional evidence that the EPA’s initial review of the North Birmingham site was undermined by a misinformation campaign, and that North Birmingham should be reconsidered for the National Priority List. This week’s indictment in the EPA Superfund site case was a step forward for residents of North Birmingham who were the victim of corruption and hazardous pollution. But we still have work to do seeking justice for families whose homes and communities have been contaminated!! Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. In the new Congress, we're going to fight to lower healthcare costs and protect access for ALL Americans. https://t.co/bVB4NJkoRr This week, new Members of Congress from across the country are in the Capitol for orientation. I'm proud to see so many women among the new faces! Congrats to all our newly-elected lawmakers who broke glass ceilings this year!! https://t.co/FGRP14a8wG As a Southern Democrat who represents the urban and rural heartland, I know that our party needs to engage progressive, moderate, and conservative communities in order to build a winning coalition. https://t.co/UHMtBlJGYs Today my staff had the pleasure of attending the Eastern Area Mayor’s Association meeting, led by Center Point's Mayor, Tom Henderson. This group is a champion for regional cooperation in Eastern Jefferson County and we're happy to stand with them in this cause. https://t.co/kC2QigYn49 Join me today in honoring the courageous men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. Thank you to the millions of veterans, service members, and military families who have answered the call to serve and who work every day to make the world a safer place. #VeteransDay https://t.co/oHBeSx9d9O So proud of the voters, organizers, and advocates who passed democracy reforms this week in FL, MD, MI and across the country! Americans want a fair voice in our elections. With Dems in control of the House, restoring the vote is at the top of the agenda!! #RestoreTheVOTE I want to say thank you to the representatives from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation who stopped by my office this evening! Thank you for sharing your stories and for fighting to make insulin affordable for all Americans. Your work is important!! https://t.co/kdWMZ2cGei Our elections were attacked, and the American people deserve all of the facts on what happened. If Jeff Sessions was fired as a first step towards interfering in the Mueller investigation, then President Trump must be held accountable. Today’s firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions is an alarming reminder of the need for checks and balances. Here in Congress, we have a responsibility to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and the investigation into Russia’s interference in our democracy. 117 women headed to Congress and counting. Make no mistake, this was a historic election. I am so proud of all the women trailblazers who mobilized their community, ran for office, and cast their ballots. You made history. #ElectionResults2018 BREAKING: A record number of first-time congresswomen were elected to the House this year, making history!! We have fought so long to make the House of Representatives truly representative. Thank you to all the women who mobilized and voted to make this happen!! #ElectionNight Americans spoke up tonight when they put Democrats back in charge of the House. Voters want better healthcare, fair wages, and a stable future for Social Security and Medicare. Enough tax cuts for the wealthy, it's time to invest in our working families. #ElectionNight The polls are open!! Time to make your voice heard Alabama! Here's more info this #ElectionDay on when, where, and how to vote: https://t.co/pjsjdbqH5e Today I awoke with VOTING on my mind!

President Trump’s proposed Executive Order would not only be unjust, it would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to all people born in the United States. It is a constitutional right not subject to the whims of our president. I’ve never been more grateful an executive order can’t override the constitution…In case you missed this part of your civics class @RealDonaldTrump here’s a refresher! #14thAmendment
