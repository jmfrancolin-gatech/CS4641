Wise man. Happy Birthday President Reagan. https://t.co/v5EqfqIhUe .@realDonaldTrump's #SOTU was a positive, unifying message where he reminded us all why our nation—and our American values of freedom &amp; democracy are the envy of the rest of the world. 

Bottom line—our future is bright.

We've seen businesses expand, reinvest in the future and create over 25,000 jobs in Oklahoma. https://t.co/sIMzZOKpKf @realDonaldTrump Our NATO allies fully support this action, and continued consultation is critical. We cannot keep jeopardizing our partners, troops and infrastructure for a one-sided treaty. It’s been 60 days since @realDonaldTrump told Vladimir Putin to stop violating the INF treaty, but Russia hasn’t taken any meaningful steps to come into compliance. I’m pleased that the United States will begin the process to formally withdraw. https://t.co/jpCen1DlaN There is an old document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution. Too often today, students aren’t being taught about the Constitution, its history or its principles. 

@SenAngusKing, @ChrisCoons and I introduced the CIVICS Act today to change that. https://t.co/ownw1brYqu Counselor Sarah Kirk and Principal Cindy Stone of @MonroeCARES Elementary, part of @NormanSchools, stopped by my D.C. office today. @Counselor_Kirk is the 2018 Oklahoma Counselor of the Year and one of six finalists for the @ASCAtweets #SCOY19 Award. What an accomplishment! https://t.co/jxKj0hqlLo Glad to intro S. 249 w/ @SenatorMenendez, @marcorubio, @SenSherrodBrown @SenMarkey, @SenBillCassidy, @JohnBoozman &amp; @SenatorLankford. This bill calls for the Sec State to develop a strategy for Taiwan to regain observer status in the WHO. It's time Taiwan had a seat at the table Taiwan has long shown its commitment to world health and has earned a seat at the table in all international bodies, especially those where they have shown substantial positive leadership. Actively working to include Taiwan in the World Health Assembly will go a long way in checking China’s efforts to enact their expansionist agenda through international organizations. China continues to block Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Assembly through diplomatic bullying for the third consecutive year. Looking forward to the great things we'll get done under @realDonaldTrump and @EPAAWheeler in 2019. Bc of their leadership, Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, homebuilders and energy producers can now focus on their business instead of red tape. 

Look at all we did in 2018: https://t.co/RqvopFjydN RT @hughhewitt: Up next: @JimInhofe, Chair of @SASCMajority "For workforce innovation to occur, we need the private and public sectors working together and connecting different ideas in the pursuit of a common goal — more qualified workers."

☑️ Funds @realDonaldTrump's border wall 
☑️ Penalizes those who cross the border illegally
☑️ Closes loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits @SecPompeo We will no longer tolerate Russian deception at the expense of national security &amp;the security of our allies. While we’ve lived up to our commitments under the treaty, Russia has violated it for years w/o repercussions—putting our troops, allies and infrastructure at greater risk @SecPompeo has put Putin on the clock—60 days to change course and comply with the treaty, or else the United States will withdraw. A treaty with only one side complying is unsustainable. Can Putin be trusted to uphold Russia’s international commitments? I won’t hold my breath. https://t.co/cL6sI4WMEC BREAKING: @jctgov just made it official—they found that my bill, the #WALLAct will save more than enough money to fully fund President @realDonaldTrump's wall!

Under @POTUS, we're rebuilding the military, growing our economy &amp;are about to confirm the right man to #SCOTUS - Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/SCEJRM8NPI RT @okstatechamber: We were honored to hear from our Congressional delegation this morning. Thank you to @JimInhofe, @TomColeOK04, @RepFran… I enjoyed participating in @the_USO’s #MilSpouseSalute event today filling care packages for military spouses! To all of the spouses out their who have loved ones serving, your selflessness and sacrifice is greatly appreciated. https://t.co/Aa4buEeM3A I am deeply honored my colleagues selected me to lead the SASC. America is facing new and unprecedented threats different from anything we’ve seen before. I look forward to working with @SenJackReed and the entire committee to ensure our military is ready to defend America. https://t.co/Hf6Jfzejyf RT @SenateGOP: “He was passionate for the causes that he believed in, a strong advocate for human rights and democratic values, standing up… Our economy continues to grow at record levels. https://t.co/u3vWw0HNRh RT @SenateGOP: Senators remember American hero, @SenJohnMcCain. 🇺🇸 He will be missed. https://t.co/wG0wJPZr50 You always remember the people who help you when no one else would. John McCain was a fighter who was deeply loyal to his country, his family, his constituents &amp;the causes he cared about. He was a patriot &amp;always faithful. @SenJohnMcCain, thank you for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/KmTVpmHP7q RT @jason_donner: Senator Inhofe calls John McCain “my hero.” &amp; says McCain’s “part of this institution we call the Senate.” John was a fighter for the causes he cared about and for the American people. He will be missed. Read my full statement below. https://t.co/w2YOG0rcZz My prayers are with @SenJohnMcCain and his family today during this difficult time. In addition to the wall, We must close loopholes illegal aliens use to come into the US. If we reform the asylum process, we can minimize false claims, ease court backlog &amp;end 'catch and release'—improving the process for those who truly need it.

In his @nytimes oped ‘‘A Liberal’s Case for Brett Kavanaugh,’’ Yale Law professor Akhil Amar said ‘‘Good appellate judges faithfully follow the Supreme Court; great ones influence and help steer it.’’ He was referring to Kavanaugh. https://t.co/ra83jCFKV6 In 2017, without a one-sided international agreement &amp; the punishing Clean Power Plan, the United States led the world in CO2 reductions, while China &amp;India led the world in increasing CO2. The left wants you to believe we were endangering the environment. It's just not true. https://t.co/rfjzPEdJJT I am glad @realDonaldTrump is standing with the brave men and women who protect our borders. 

I visited the U.S.- Mexico border earlier this month and talked to @FoxNews about a bill I'm introducing to ease immigration court backlog.

The men and women who served aboard the USS Oklahoma are true heroes. Read more from the @DeptVetAffairs below ➡ https://t.co/gpvxUm7J43 Today, @POTUS signed the #FY19NDAA into law, yet again proving himself a great leader in our effort to rebuild the military &amp;restore our qualitative &amp;quantitative advantage. To each of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines–this is the help we have promised; it is on the way. https://t.co/TABlLSMeRK RT @SenateGOP: “[Judge Kavanaugh] is a superb choice for the Supreme Court” – @JimInhofe  #SCOTUS https://t.co/PIDF597jv5 The economy is booming w/ the leadership of @POTUS.

"The Trump bump continues, &amp;Main Street appears to be intact. U.S. small-business owners are more optimistic now than at any point in the 15-year history of the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index."

https://t.co/3oxESRXz8R Proud of the work we've done in the #FY19NDAA to ensure Oklahoma’s military installations &amp; service members have the support they need. Looking forward to @POTUS signing this into law.
 
I was at the @MWCChamber &amp;@138thFW last week talking to @NewsOn6, @NEWS9, @koconews &amp;@OKCFOX: https://t.co/UcZRftx3hM 3 months ago, @POTUS stood up against Iran’s malign behavior by pulling out of flawed Iran Deal. Today, he continues his leadership by reimposing sanctions that will show Iran their support for terrorism &amp;expansion of ICBM capabilities is unacceptable.

I'm pleased that the #FY19NDAA passed in record time, the earliest since 1996. I look forward to @realDonaldTrump signing this into law soon. https://t.co/J78MpGEZPE RT @SenJohnMcCain: I'm deeply proud the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to pass the #FY19NDAA. I thank my colleagues @SenJackReed @JimInh… Good news - @POTUS just signed the Perkins CTE Act that gives states the ability to put resources to students, not regulations, and allows them flexibility to support the needs of each state, not a one-size-fits-all policy. Hear why this is so important to Oklahoma: https://t.co/wPWtKRhU1o States hostile to fossil fuels have taken advantage of loopholes in the Clean Water Act to block projects they simply don’t like, circumventing the needs of other states &amp;communities. This must stop. Proud to introduce this bill w/ @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenCapito &amp;@SteveDaines https://t.co/hQcbwPhRJj Just another example of how @realDonaldTrump’s efforts are bringing about positive change. This man knows what he’s doing. 

https://t.co/NS4ELrVBWB The opportunity to meet with Judge #Kavanaugh solidified what I already knew—he is a superb choice for #SCOTUS. The future of my 20 kids and grandkids underscores the importance of confirming good, conservative judges who value &amp;uphold the Constitution. He will serve America well https://t.co/yajk0xGMLj Glad @realDonaldTrump is taking a tough stand against Turkey’s wrongful imprisonment of US citizens. We must continue this progress with the passage of the #FY19NDAA. https://t.co/LkwfljupDL Congrats to Liz and all of Oklahoma’s athletes who competed in the @SpecialOlympics @2018USAGames this month 🏅🏅 https://t.co/F8hEiPkU4R RT @SASCMajority: Senate and House Armed Services Committees Complete Conference on #FY19NDAA https://t.co/bqlPbk9ME2 Glad the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Robert Wilkie tonight.
