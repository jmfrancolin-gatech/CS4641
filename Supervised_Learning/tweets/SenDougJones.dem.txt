There is more to be said that just can‚Äôt be done in a few tweets, so I‚Äôd urge you to read my full statement here: https://t.co/DMdYhtTveM -- Doug After thorough consideration, I have concluded that Mr. Barr is qualified for the position &amp; his record strongly suggests he will exercise independent judgment &amp; uphold the best interests of the DoJ. I will vote to confirm Mr. Barr as AG of the United States. Finally, in my conversation w/ Mr. Barr, I stressed how important the DoJ‚Äôs civil rights functions are to me &amp; the people of Alabama. Mr. Barr assured me of his commitment to protecting civil rights, including the vigorous enforcement of voting rights protections. Some have expressed concerns about Mr. Barr‚Äôs views of executive power, which frankly are much more expansive than my own. In his hearing &amp; in my conversation w/him, he reiterated that he believes no one -- including the President of the United States -- is above the law. As a former US Attorney, I believe the most important responsibility of an AG l is to uphold the rule of law &amp; to do so w/a commitment to transparency &amp; independence. We live in deeply divided times, but it is in precisely this environment that these principles are critical. I have spent nearly two months examining Mr. Barr‚Äôs record, watching his hearings, and listening to &amp; considering the input of my constituents &amp; leaders in the justice community. I have spoken with Mr. Barr and asked him some tough questions of my own. RT @ALReporter: Jones bill would require Department of Defense to justify ‚Äúnational security tariffs‚Äù

Period. https://t.co/cC6vYOPG4k Started my day at the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast - needed that!

This covers 75% of the project‚Äôs cost and is a great step toward rebuilding the community. The Kavanaugh nomination process has been flawed from the beginning and incomplete at the end. Dr. Ford was credible and courageous and I am concerned about the message our vote will be sending to our sons and daughters, as well as victims of sexual assault. I will be voting no. Today we took an important step for families of civil rights cold case victims‚Äìmy bipartisan Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act earned committee approval &amp; is 1 step closer to becoming law. Let this be a reminder that justice delayed doesn't have to be justice denied. https://t.co/BEez48QWkf So many remarkable song writers have been born out of the south &amp; they deserve to have their hard work protected.

This legislation is another smart step to stop illicit fentanyl from being transported across our borders and into our communities.

Come on out if you‚Äôre interested in attending one! https://t.co/d0T37iR9bv I‚Äôve successfully prosecuted 38-year-old crimes. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was the right thing to do to get justice for the victims. 

All I‚Äòm asking for is a full, fair investigation. Let‚Äôs get to the truth, whatever it may be.

It is more important than ever to hit the pause button on Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation vote until we can fully investigate these serious and disturbing allegations. We cannot rush to move forward under this cloud. https://t.co/SIHzdnnOFJ Later this morning at the church, I'll be honoring their memory and talking about the need to come together as a community and as a country. We hear some of the same rhetoric today that was used in 1963. Words matter, folks. And we can never let something like this happen again. Addie Mae. Carole. Cynthia. Carol Denise. Today, we remember these four bright little girls who were killed at the 16th St Baptist Church 55 years ago in a bombing perpetrated by the KKK. This case and these families will always hold a special meaning for me. https://t.co/4eeSvqUx41 We're fortunate to have Dr. @mattmight leading the way at @UABNews on #PrecisionMedicine.
