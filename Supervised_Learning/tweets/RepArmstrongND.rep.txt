Check out my interview with @robport. We cover #SOTU, Committees, #2ndAmendment, border security and much more. Glad to join Rob weekly for this chat. #NorthDakota #NDpol #116thCongress https://t.co/q2jkrEHZUv The Democratic proposal on guns makes felons out of thousands of #NorthDakota ranchers and farmers. It outlaws borrowing your friend‚Äôs rifle for target practice on your own land. #2ndAmendment #NDpol https://t.co/3QPpCtEw8b The #GreenNewDeal is a raw deal for North Dakota and all of America. It‚Äôs a ridiculous proposal from beginning to end. 

ND grows the world‚Äôs food &amp; produces the world‚Äôs energy. This proposal ends North Dakota‚Äôs economy as we know it.

The bill ensures that any baby born alive after an abortion receives the same level of care as other newborns. #StandforLife https://t.co/y9Uz5KvIjV When I filled in today for the Ranking Member at the @GOPoversight hearing, I gave the witnesses a bit of #NorthDakota trivia. We are the only state without voter registration.

Local control of voting laws is best. We don't need a top-down approach from DC. #HR1 https://t.co/uujvKkKTp1 About to join @scotthennen live on @wzfgradio.

Tune in tonight! #NorthDakota #NDpol https://t.co/XwdhGd7Kb8 Today, 13 Democrats supported our motion. Yesterday, 10 supported our motion and last week, 6 supported it. 

We should pay federal workers while we continue to work on securing the border and fully reopen the government. (2/2) House Republicans have repeatedly tried to give federal workers their missed paychecks. 

As we work towards securing the border and reopening the government, our amendment would fund the past pay periods for federal workers, allowing them to be paid right away. (1/2) I'll be joining @scotthennen on @wzfgradio in a moment. Tune in to AM 1100 or listen live online here https://t.co/zt6Cm1ZxlV #NDpol #NorthDakota I'm happy to announce that I will serve on the House Oversight and Reform Committee (@GOPoversight), the main investigative committee in the House. #NorthDakota #NDPol #116thCongress https://t.co/YojYm36aIT https://t.co/WTH6j2r4Ez This is great news for #NorthDakota farmers and ranchers!

@USDA just announced that starting Thursday, Farm Service Agency staff will begin to process new loans and other services for ND's farmers and ranchers. All FSA offices in ND will reopen Jan 24 https://t.co/2rb4NJWkcT "The time is always right to do what is right.‚Äù -Martin Luther King, Jr.

Agri-businesses across N.D. need access to capital to manage their cashflows. The offices will be open Jan. 17, 18 &amp; 22. #NDpol https://t.co/QnobdrCSOS The selection of the Northern Plains Unmanned Aerial Systems Test Site as part of a pilot program in drone traffic management keeps #NorthDakota on the cutting edge of drone technology and development. https://t.co/gPz9X8RPlx I spoke to @robport about the shutdown, border security and my first couple weeks serving #NorthDakota in Congress. Our segment starts around the 11:35 mark. https://t.co/d9z7pBXwaL No #NorthDakota office is complete without @dotspretzels. Any North Dakotan in DC can come by my office to get a little taste of home. #NDpol #116thcongress https://t.co/xcRh0qCp6Y This bill ties in well to Gov. @DougBurgum's Main Street Initiative, which helps #NorthDakota communities capitalize on their unique strengths to compete and succeed in a global economy. #NDpol Small businesses throughout #NorthDakota need access to capital to hire more employees or expand into new products or locations. Tonight, I voted for the Investing in Main Street Act, which expands funding opportunities for small businesses. #116thCongress Semper Paratus (Always Ready) is the motto of the @USCG. Honored to meet with them today and receive the official Coast Guard seal to display in my office. #116thCongress #NorthDakota #NDpol https://t.co/bXrhBMKvw9 For those wondering, my DC office is OPEN today, despite the federal government being closed due to snow. A measly few inches of snow won't stop us from being in the office working on behalf of #NorthDakota. I spoke to @CNNPolitics about the shutdown, baseball, four-wheel-drive and one of my favorite songs, Brave Man's Death by @JRoddyBusiness #NDpol #NorthDakota #116thCongress  https://t.co/pqOiuW6H80 #Subscribe at https://t.co/qHs0P2k1pB to get the inside scoop on what's going on in Washington direct to your üì± or üíª and my work to make #NorthDakota a better place to live, work and raise a family. üá∫üá∏¬†#NDpol Last night, the president made it clear that we have a humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border. Democrats need to negotiate in good faith and work with this administration to end this government shutdown and secure our border. #NDpol #NorthDakota I'm just a non-celebrity new Member of Congress. Are you offering classes on hypocrisy? Is it a Dems only class? .@AOC, just watched your interview on @maddow . Yesterday @washingtonpost called you out for not having your facts straight during your interview on @60Minutes. Today you told @POTUS to get his facts straight... I'm confused. This is good news. I‚Äôm glad China is coming to the table on trade negotiations and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre coming to our markets for more American soybeans. https://t.co/LKaRk3rPEv Congratulations, @NDSUfootball! That's üèÜ #7 for the #Bison. Thanks for five incredible seasons, @CoachKli! #FCSChampionship #RaiseTheBar https://t.co/vmSxwjhdpO Let‚Äôs retake the momentum in the second half, #Bison! @NDSUfootball started strong, but we knew @EWUFootball wouldn‚Äôt be easy. Let‚Äôs play hard and bring home üèÜ #7! #RaiseTheBar #FCSChampionship https://t.co/NnOrKDwdHl We mourn the loss of a giant in the corn industry, a longtime champion of agriculture, Dale Ihry. Dale never stopped advocating for North Dakota. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/7igLAqZ4wD This behavior and language is abhorrent and unacceptable for a Member of Congress, especially in reference to the leader of our country. @RepRashida should apologize for her foul language. https://t.co/g6OjJcIVgp Let‚Äôs bring home the SEVENTH üèÜ,  @NDSUfootball! Go hard, play hard, we have great faith in you! #FCSChampionship #RaiseTheBar #FargoToFrisco https://t.co/GAzgVwj1rX These moves are a mistake. I‚Äôm hopeful common-sense members across the aisle will work with me in a bipartisan fashion to help grow jobs, raise wages, and expand opportunities for North Dakota farmers, ranchers and energy workers. #116thCongress .@SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats also made it easier to grow the #NationalDebt and avoid accountability. With procedural tricks, they can suspend the debt limit. This is wrong. The job of Congress is to take votes and answer for those votes to the people. https://t.co/RHC6iRNTco I‚Äôm disappointed that on the first day of the #116thCongress, @SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats made it easier to raise taxes on hard-working Americans. Their agenda is a #TaxIncrease Agenda. I‚Äôll fight to keep taxes low for all North Dakotans. https://t.co/DkKHipkYXM Glad to be here! Looking forward to working with both of you to move #NorthDakota forward. #116thCongress https://t.co/BSWCXxZT7C It‚Äôs an honor to represent the great people of North Dakota in the House of Representatives, and I‚Äôm ready to go to work to make sure North Dakota‚Äôs voice is heard in Washington. #116thCongress #ND #NDPol https://t.co/yPtJ53jcDq
