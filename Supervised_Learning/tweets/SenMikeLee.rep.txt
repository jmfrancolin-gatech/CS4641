https://t.co/GTazlUU2Rc I also agree with the President that Congress should pass legislation to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. (4/4) I have co-sponsored two bipartisan bills to lower drug prices, the CREATES Act and the Short on Competition Act, and I hope we can move these bipartisan efforts forward to lower drug prices for all Americans. (3/4) There should be a commonsense solution to the migration crisis on our southern border. One that involves more beds, more judges, and yes, more wall. There is also much we can do on drug prices. (2/4) It was great seeing Matthew Charles, the first person to benefit from #TheFirstStepAct, as a guest of President Trump tonight. Criminal justice reform is just the beginning of what we can accomplish together on a bipartisan basis.

Read the bill. Earning time credits does not grant an inmate release. Inmates must still undergo risk assessment and be deemed low-risk offenders. https://t.co/m8eWCyZnXa If @SenTomCotton has good faith problems with this bill then he should welcome a full and open debate on the Senate floor where he can offer amendments to provisions he finds objectionable. But first this bill needs to be brought to the Senate floor so debate can begin. /END Nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release. It only incentivizes participation in recidivism reduction programs. At all times the Bureau of Prisons retains all authority over who does and does not qualify for early release. 5/ What the First Step Act does do is encourage rehabilitation by incentivizing inmates to participate in recidivism reduction programs by giving them time credits that can help them qualify for prerelease custody. 4/ Second, and more importantly, the First Step Act does not “give early release” to anyone. Anyone claiming it does, does not understand how the bill works. 3/ First, the House Judiciary committee passed the First Step Act out of committee on May 9 of this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the highly similar Sentencing and Corrections Act out of committee on Feb 15 of this year.

RT @GlenMillsABC4: #Utah senators weigh in during heated hearing for #SCOTUS nominee. #utpol @abc4utah @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee https://t… Here’s a quick update on today’s #SCOTUS hearing so far: https://t.co/8rEnaUFsyr There’s a better way for the #Senate to approach its work. This process should be about a jurist’s qualifications, character, and approach to judging. It should not be about results in a select number of cases. This undermines the legitimacy of the courts. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle. Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle. Sure enough, last term in Ortiz v. United States, #SCOTUS considered a case implicating the scope of Marbury. Likewise, Justice Ginsburg created the so-called “Ginsburg standard”—no previews, forecasts, or hints. Nominees, for the most part, have resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises on how they’ll vote. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whether Marbury v. Madison was settled law, on the ground that it could come before him. This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created a norm in which members demand that nominees talk about specific cases in return for favorable treatment. Without getting into the gory details, suffice to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on constitutional law. Kennedy’s response was to savage – unfairly – the results he thought Bork would reach. Twenty-eight years later, the Senate considered Robert Bork’s nomination. This was another turning point, and in my view, remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate. Justice Stewart’s 1959 nomination was another turning point. Senators seeking to resist Brown v. Board of Education wanted to grill Stewart about his views on integration. Others wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security. But Senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, Senators wanted assurances Frankfurter would reach certain results. Frankfurter, however, declined to engage w/Senators &amp; insisted his public record spoke for itself The next important moment was in 1939, when Justice Frankfurter became the first #SCOTUS nominee to testify before the Senate. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas. They didn’t ask Brandeis to testify, but asked outside witnesses to talk about his nomination. But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use a seat on #SCOTUS to advocate for progressive causes he championed as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he would vote in particular cases. The first #SCOTUS confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, when Justice Brandeis was nominated. Brandeis was controversial for several reasons—including, it has to be said, because he was Jewish. When you look at the history, that is precisely why confirmation hearings developed—so that Senators could ask nominees how they would vote in particular cases. Some of these unfair questions will ask him to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases likely to come before the Court. Over the next few days, senators will ask Judge #Kavanaugh questions about #SCOTUS cases, his record, and his qualifications. Some of these questions will be fair. Many others will be unfair. What is the real context of today’s #SCOTUS hearing? Here are some facts: Getting ready to go live on @foxandfriends to discuss this week’s #Kavanaugh #SCOTUS hearings. Tune in!

Once the event begins, you can stream the event live and ask questions there as well as on my Facebook page #LeeTownhall #utpol RT @SenLeePressSec: HAPPENING NOW: @SenMikeLee joins @D2KSL on @kslnewsradio to discuss 3D printed guns and the 1st Amendment. Listen here:… Any legislation that comes from Congress that begins with, “It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally publish…” ought to be concerning to each and everyone one of us, Democrats and Republicans alike. https://t.co/yglmgvKcD2 If we aren’t willing to adopt even modest reforms to a minor program like NFIP, how will we ever address any of the far more vexing problems facing our government? We have a spending problem in DC, one created by politicians using middle class families to subsidize the rich. Taxpayers should not pay any amount of coverage for the top 1% that can afford a $2.5 million-dollar beach home. https://t.co/tL1t8Ch0ZS https://t.co/bGgAQK1Fgn A big thanks to @RepRobBishop, @RepChrisStewart, @RepJohnCurtis, @RepMiaLove, @senorrinhatch, the Utah Food Industry Association, and all the Utah companies that made this event possible. We’re already getting excited for next year! What started as a small event hosted out of our Washington D.C. office has grown into a widely attended event highlighting some great #Utah companies and products. With Utahns working together, #TasteOfUtahDC will continue to grow for years to come #utpol
https://t.co/Xoz2LazKO7 Brick and mortar businesses benefit when they partner with an online presence, which is why companies and constituents like these in Spanish Fork need a free and open internet. Thanks to the @internetAssn for hosting this business crawl. https://t.co/sskc7z415M Who wore it better? The @SkiUtah yeti or @RepRobBishop? #utpol #TasteOfUtahDC https://t.co/6dD5QSPEhG Thanks to all the vendors and #Utah companies who helped make tonight a success!

Happy Pioneer Day on behalf of the best state in the Union! #utpol https://t.co/zR1U5QRymc Thanks, @realDonaldTrump for recognizing #PioneerDay and the pioneering spirit that still exists in Utah today! #utpol https://t.co/49NyLhCzpk It’s here!
