They provided advice on achieving office priorities, exactly as provided for under Missouri law Not a penny was spent in the AG’s office for any campaign, ever. And no employee ever asked to participate in political activity Dems claim my work in AG’s office in first months of 2017 was to benefit Senate campaign. There was no Senate campaign. Wasn’t even an exploratory committee until August This complaint about my work as AG by Hillary Clinton henchman David Brock is totally absurd.
