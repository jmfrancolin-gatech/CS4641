https://t.co/dI3zGXRfrP By repealing these outdated provisions that unfairly penalize public servants in Illinois, we can provide some certainty to retirees while helping to recruit future teachers, firefighters, and police officers. This bill ensures that a teacher who spends his or her summers working a second job or a police officer who changes careers after years of service will not face a possible 40 percent reduction in their Social Security benefits. These two titles of the Social Security Act unfairly reduce or eliminate Social Security benefits for millions of Americans who have devoted much of their careers to public service. This week, I introduced the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, which eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO).

It displays the names of Americans who gave their lives to protect our freedoms. We will never forget their service &amp; sacrifice. https://t.co/obaa9HyPZZ Joined Gale Cunningham on @WYXY991 in Champaign this morning to talk about tornado recovery efforts in Taylorville and the Farm Bill that passed both the House and Senate this week. https://t.co/lMtHeYkvhL Read more here ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/nJqpFt0SgN This is a missed opportunity, and if our economy is going to continue grow, we‚Äôre going to need to fill the jobs that are open. I hope Democrats in the House will set the election aside and make this a priority next year. We‚Äôve written a strong bill for our farmers, but 80% of this bill is SNAP. While there is a slight increase in employment and training, not every able-bodied adult will have access to this job training program like they would have under the House bill.

Getting a #FarmBill across the finish line this year for my farmers has always been my goal, and I‚Äôm excited to vote today to send this legislation to the president‚Äôs desk for signature. https://t.co/5yfRZz0zic Tune in here: https://t.co/rbo5QdXbUg The #FarmBill conference report is a strong bill for our farmers. As a conferee, I was proud to sign it and I look forward to speaking on the House floor today in support of this bill. https://t.co/LscQqSsEqa @HouseAdmnGOP @GreggHarper My office has participated in this program for several years, and I know the value and joy it brings not only to the participants, but also to the Members and staff of the offices they work in. https://t.co/P0gZesV1mR @HouseAdmnGOP Chairman @GreggHarper has been a champion for disabilities and I cannot thank him enough for creating this important program. I will ensure that his legacy, the Harper Program, continues on our Committee in the 116th Congress and beyond.

This is exciting news and will continue the great progress being made in Springfield.
