Friday Follow-Up, episode 4: State of The Union address, The Medicare Negotiation &amp; Competitive Licensing Act to reduce prescription drug prices, and only ~50 days until the expiration of DED. Please keep sharing your comments and ideas, and have a great weekend! #FridayFollowUp https://t.co/2sQvEitPBD Salient words of advice from an icon of the US House, Rep. John Dingell, who has passed away at age 92. From his role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to the Endangered Species Act, he left an indelible mark on America. @RepDebDingell and family are in our hearts tonight. https://t.co/KdntRH3V0e Proud to join @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenSherrodBrown, @RepLloydDoggett,  @PeterWelch and others today as an original co-sponsor of The Medicare Negotiation &amp; Competitive Licensing Act. 90% of Americans agree it‚Äôs time for Medicare to reduce the burden on patients &amp; taxpayers.#action https://t.co/iJoRNwtAI6 Former Stanley Cup winner with the LA Kings and all-around great guy, @KWesty19 stopped by to give me some pointers for next year‚Äôs game (I forgot my equipment for tonight‚Äôs) and try on my dad‚Äôs 1960 St. Paul Central glove. #StateOfHockey #HockeyOnTheHill https://t.co/byMWWz24wp .@jonlovett Lemme know if you need a lightly used, #SOTU experienced, white dinner jacket with an ‚ÄúERA Now‚Äù pin applied by @AOC for tonight‚Äôs show. https://t.co/HaHPAsQjgQ I wore white to the #SOTU to honor the extraordinary women of the 116th Congress, to honor my mother Dee Dee, whose ‚ÄúERA Now‚Äù pin I remember well, and the suffragettes, whose tireless work afforded my great-grandmothers, Sara Johnson and Rose Phillips, the right to vote in 1920. https://t.co/aPW42XQzYB I applaud @POTUS‚Äôs call for bipartisanship, reducing the cost of healthcare &amp; prescriptions, fighting childhood cancer, investing in infrastructure &amp; paid family leave. But we can‚Äôt forget about draining the swamp: ethics reform, voter protection, &amp; campaign finance reform. #HR1 Friday Follow-Up, episode 3: Maria Sanford, sub-committee assignments, and anti-shutdown, anti-dark money and Election Day holiday legislation. Representation begins with listening, so please share your comments, perspectives and ideas, and have a great weekend! https://t.co/rz3QKfmtRH This wasn‚Äôt high school. This wasn‚Äôt college. This was during medical school in the 1980‚Äôs. The people of Virginia will dictate Gov. Northam‚Äôs future, but one thing is clear; elected officials should be held to the same standard no matter which political party they represent. https://t.co/QFYtPKyfrS Are you appalled by our #27 ranking in voter turnout among developed democracies? I am. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm co-sponsoring #HR1, the #ForThePeopleAct, to make Election Day a holiday, registration easier &amp; voting more accessible to millions of Americans. Isn‚Äôt that our job?@House_DRTF https://t.co/Ulyf9i5EDu Sen. McConnell opposes making Election Day a holiday because he believes federal employees already have enough days off. So let‚Äôs make a deal, and trade Columbus Day for Election Day. The day we vote is worthy of such reverence.

If you agree, please spread the word! #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact https://t.co/FYlQS0NAem Seventy-fours years ago today,  the #Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated - ending one of the darkest chapters of human history. With fewer and fewer survivors still living, it is now up to us to share their stories and ensure it never happens again. #WeRemember‚Å† It‚Äôs time for Friday Follow-Up II. The shutdown is over! Negotiations will begin immediately, and I hope to inspire bold and permanent solutions for border security and immigration reform - including DACA, TPS and DED, which I‚Äôve implored be included in any deal. https://t.co/WooU8odKl1 The President just announced he‚Äôll sign the 3-week, continuing resolution to RE-OPEN government for which I and fellow D and R members of the Problem Solvers Caucus advocated during our meeting with him last week. Now it‚Äôs up to members of both parties to negotiate in good faith. https://t.co/WKLRgKSWra Henry, our Norwich Terrier, helps me with canine constituent services and hopes to become a pawliamentarian someday üêæ #dogs @dog_rates @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/a2w5WK3Wev @KGinMN @2harvest Amazing!üôåüèª Legislation to re-open government that we‚Äòve already passed in the House will receive a vote in the Senate on Thursday. Sixty senators and one President can end this madness by week‚Äôs end, and we can get to work immediately on a border security and immigration reform package. https://t.co/5LQ0Za9vxN A strong and brave America should encourage those of physical and mental fortitude to serve in our armed forces - no matter how they look, pray or identify. Trans people now protecting our nation in uniform are far more honorable than those hoping to ban their service. #truth https://t.co/wdeagtlRNw An inspiring morning at ‚Å¶@NorthHennepin‚Å© w/Mayors Lunde and Harris talking transit and Trio, followed by fascinating visits to ‚Å¶@getolympus‚Å© and ‚Å¶@TakedaPharma‚Å© facilities in ‚Å¶@BrooklynPark‚Å©.

Let‚Äôs get to work. #MLKDay‚Å† https://t.co/kUWiDqXFtc Thank you for the wonderful 50th birthday wishes, roasts, toasts and posts. I‚Äôm grateful for the blessings of amazing family, friends, staff, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And hair. https://t.co/UwrcfVYWLn @LeaderHoyer Thank you, Steny!

I believe a bipartisan deal can be reached that satisfies our need for enhanced border security AND immigration reform, but government must be re-opened for that to occur. At the @WhiteHouse this week, we asked The President to re-open government, pay those who protect us in the skies, on the ground, on the seas, and at our borders - and demand a bipartisan border security &amp; immigration reform package from Congress. I hope he does so today. #enough https://t.co/YvPcRoWtU7 @calvertsand Thank you, Sandy!üôåüèª RT @RBReich: Mitch McConnell calls #HR1 a "power grab" because it would: 
1) Begin to overturn Citizens United. 
2) Establish Automatic Vot‚Ä¶ TGIF! That means it‚Äôs time for my first Friday Follow Up - a review of the past week in Congress. https://t.co/Hw3kNNu5fe I never imagined the best endorsement for #HR1 would come from ‚Å¶‚Å¶Sen. McConnell, who opposes: transparency, cleaning-up corruption, voter protection and empowerment, ethics reform, campaign law enforcement enhancement, and campaign finance reform.  https://t.co/GjAucgrLqB Pleased to announce my assignments to the House Financial Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee. Eager to work with my colleagues on both sides to promote truth, justice, opportunity for all, a strong economy, consumer protection &amp; improved relations around the globe. From mtg w/The President at the @WhiteHouse, to voting on bills to open govt, to convening R &amp; D colleagues, I‚Äôve spent my first two weeks in Congress working to inspire a cessation of animosity in favor of action. One thing is clear:  it won‚Äôt happen w/o Americans demanding it. Thanks, Tennessee, for showing us what can be achieved when possibility transcends partisanship. https://t.co/2zcMBETuG0 We absolutely must secure our borders and enforce our laws. That‚Äôs why the Senate must immediately appropriate money to pay our border officers and agents,@realDonaldTrump should sign it into law and Congress should draft a bipartisan border security &amp; immigration reform package. https://t.co/NjqlXLvXQY Actually, Mr. President, many of us are here - reasonable Ds and Rs who want our government open, border and port security enhanced, and immigration system reformed. Why not agree to end the shutdown and demand a comprehensive bill from Congress for your signature? #LetsGetToIt https://t.co/WtS8XZzQBG RT @RepDeanPhillips: @realDonaldTrump Hi, Mr. President.

a) re-opening our government so federal employees, many of whom ensure our safety and security, get paid

#letsgetitdone The longest shutdown in our history is hurting millions and represents yet another stain on our nation. My message to @POTUS &amp; Congress is clear: immediately end the shutdown and let‚Äôs begin negotiating a comprehensive, bipartisan border security + immigration reform package. Thoughts and tweets don't save lives; action saves lives. That‚Äôs why I cosponsored my second bill yesterday, #HR8, requiring universal background checks on all gun sales. And this morning, we dedicated our cloakroom in honor of @GabbyGiffords and the late Rep. Leo Ryan. #courage https://t.co/oOnLPiIgc6 In solidarity with hard-working federal employees who are working without pay or on furlough, I have officially requested that my salary be withheld until the shutdown ends. I‚Äôll divide my #shutdownpay equally, and contribute it to @2harvest, @CornerstoneMN and @VVAmerica. https://t.co/JDHhV4FYPO Americans expect and deserve common sense solutions from effective leaders in both parties. First, the President must end the shutdown immediately. Second, fact-based border security enhancement and humane immigration reform bills must be swiftly debated, passed &amp; implemented. @Rabbijb @RepDean Love that!! Funny what happens when @RepDean and I sit next to one another at the bi-partisan Congressional Research Service orientation for freshmen! https://t.co/Jhlq3XDMVC @scottsphoto And I‚Äôm honored to use it, Scott. Thank you! @Gwen_Michael @KyloInMN Hi, Gwen. I‚Äôd be happy to meet and learn about what‚Äôs important to you. Send me a direct message and we can get it scheduled asap. Thanks! Welcome to my official Twitter! On Day 1, we voted on an appropriations package to re-open government. On Day 2, we introduced #HR1 to improve ethics, protect and empower voters, and address the corrupting influence of money in politics. Hitting the ground running #ForThePeople! https://t.co/Oh57GcFtFu
