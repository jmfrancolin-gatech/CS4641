What a powerful article sharing what Pine Plains native Chief Shannon Kent really did on the front lines of the fight against terrorism, gathering intelligence to protect our country. A remarkable woman and patriot, her selfless service is truly humbling. https://t.co/X6tgsqItop Proud to join the fight to ensure our government is truly for the people. https://t.co/qsPilwjLTz I spoke with @WAMCRadio recently about my focus on green jobs here in Upstate New York and how we can move towards a clean energy economy. https://t.co/e3aIkjvyrD Rural communities, including those here in Upstate New York, are suffering mightily from the absence of broadband. The time is long overdue to make broadband access for all communities, no matter how rural, a national priority.  https://t.co/TbGCuhQ4Dw I’m willing to work with anyone who is prepared to pursue this much-needed investment.  But if you can’t say anything about how we can prioritize these investments in our communities, you shouldn’t say anything at all. As a proud native of Upstate NY, raising my family here, I know what the future can hold for our community w/ right commitment. It's why I'm prioritizing investment in things like infrastructure, broadband, public edu, renewable energy &amp; sustainable ag. https://t.co/v3nE7AKVY5 Lacey and I are glad to be here this morning at the National Prayer Breakfast. The annual event brings together faith-based community leaders and elected officials on both sides of the aisle and should be a reminder of our common purpose to serve the people. https://t.co/pYr3ElWrLo Listening to constituents is an essential part of governing. We covered a lot of topics at the town hall in Sullivan County including climate change, the national debt and support for farmers.

With an Administration that too often resorts to fear-mongering and division, it is incumbent on us to lead with love. It’s people like my guest for tonight, Michael Hickey, who exposed the Hoosick Falls PFOA contamination, who inspire me on days like today. With my seat on the Agriculture Committee, I am determined to be an advocate for the small, family-owned farms that enrich NY19 from end to end. I very much enjoyed meeting with members of the @YoungFarmers from the Leatherstocking and Catskill chapters to discuss their needs as the new Farm Bill rolls out. https://t.co/vOQmOr1MT7 “Hickey said he was honored and grateful to be joining Delgado. ‘Putting a spotlight on the poisoning of residents of Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh is exactly what we need to spur action on a local and national level,’ a statement to the Times Union read." “Hoosick Falls resident Michael Hickey, who exposed toxic chemicals polluting water in his Rensselaer County village, will attend the State of the Union in Washington D.C. Tuesday as the guest of U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado.” https://t.co/5sTwl5BN28 Following my commitment to showing up everywhere and hearing from folks, I'm glad to have held three town halls in my first month in office. Highlights from Saturday's town hall in Sullivan County: https://t.co/okukwPaVz2 Thank you to all the students who came out to today's @DemocracyMatrz Summit. Seeing young people so engaged in our futures is truly inspirational, and I was so glad to get a chance to talk with them about the power people have to change our communities and our government. https://t.co/N2oxMB30Ix Listen to the final segment of WAMC's Congressional Corner where I speak about the importance of being prudent in our actions around the Mueller investigation, and how during the shutdown I focused on the people of NY19 by shining a light on their stories. https://t.co/0NE55gOgoN The freezing conditions reported at this jail are absolutely atrocious and violate the fundamental rights our Constitution guarantees. This must be addressed with the utmost urgency. https://t.co/BskWzlM98K "U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado has joined the Congressional Lyme Disease Caucus. The freshman lawmaker said he will work with his colleagues 'to advance federal support for how doctors treat it and how we decrease environmental risks.'" https://t.co/S557tCGH0u Sharing part 2 of my interview on WAMC's Congressional Corner with Alan Chartock, where we discussed the shutdown's effect on SNAP benefits and my views on how we can find common ground in negotiations. https://t.co/3HsZydzpF3 ”He said it is critical the nation enact policies to lower carbon emissions and increase investment in renewable energy sources.” “U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado wants the Department of Energy to study the demand for green jobs and create a pilot program to award grants to community colleges and small businesses to provide job training in accordance with the study’s findings.” https://t.co/fZCrsL06LG "[The] bill aims to increase transparency &amp; reduce corruption by requiring additional publicly available disclosures for lobbyists funding political ads or other political activities. It’s called the CLEAR Act, or Connecting Lobbyists and Electeds for Accountability &amp; Reform Act" "Freshman New York Congressman Antonio Delgado is introducing his second bill. The 19th District Democrat says the legislation sheds light on dark money in politics." https://t.co/N3D0Mnoqz5 “Delgado called it ‘disturbing’ that EPA would move to not regulate PFAS chemicals. The freshman Dem wrote to [EPA Administrator] Wheeler, urging EPA to: set maximum contaminant levels for PFOA &amp; PFOS, designate PFAS as a hazardous substance [and more]." https://t.co/vrqLhuMSLX It was great to join WAMC's Alan Chartock for another interview to discuss how I'm staying accessible throughout the district and how my committee appointments directly affect the issues that need to be addressed here. Listen to part 1 of 3 here:https://t.co/IgATQktaR6 Ten years ago today, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law by President Obama. With women still earning less than men on average, there is still so much work to be done to create equity for all women and I stand with them at every step. https://t.co/5YuIXsdBCX The Congressional Budget Office says 5 weeks of a government shutdown cost our economy $11 billion. And all of this for a divisive and hate based campaign promise completely void of any empirically based justification. We can’t be back here in 3 weeks. 
https://t.co/BrHy40iDgg At a time when awareness of the Holocaust is diminishing and anti-Semitic incidents are rising, it is more important than ever that we share the stories of survivors, teach our children this horrifying part of our history and most critically, stand up to hate in all of its forms. On this International Holocaust Day of Remembrance, we take a step back from our lives and remember the atrocity that was the Holocaust, where six million Jews were killed and millions of others because of their race, sexuality, or disability. I held my second town hall last night, fielding questions on everything from the government shutdown to health care to gun safety. Highlight video from the Poughkeepsie Journal: https://t.co/FcMznnXGfx Trends like those described here are simply unconscionable given the state of the healthcare crisis. We must reverse these trends and achieve universal healthcare. https://t.co/3igMD8SwpM Our residents deserve clean drinking water full stop. Without a working government to help clean up contamination we are standing in the way of making desperately-needed progress on PFAS/PFOA contamination.
https://t.co/OYaZjEaILb The impact of the government shutdown on our communities keeps growing, with new risks to airline travel. Enough with this recklessness.  Lives are literally being put in harms way. https://t.co/CQdlR9HTGJ On Friday, Freshman New York Congressman Antonio Delgado met with members of the U.S. Coast Guard in Saugerties and others impacted by the record-long partial federal government shutdown. Congressman Delgado spoke with WAMC following his meetings. More: https://t.co/m2bEXxhrXl Discrimination in any form is wrong. This ban goes against our values and takes us backwards in the struggle for a more just and equitable society. https://t.co/hJFoQSgI99 On the campaign trail, one of the things I heard about most frequently was the importance of town halls and showing up to listen. I pledged to hold town halls all across the district, and I’m proud to have held my first one yesterday.  https://t.co/s4PXNAMd5B Energizing meeting in Averill Park w/ an Indivisible group in our district. We talked about steps I'm taking to fulfill my campaign promise to always be accessible, as well as the importance of building bridges in the community, no matter what political affiliation someone has. https://t.co/u8raB1jNkN His life and words guide us as we strive to serve our families, community, and country with love and compassion. Today we honor the great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He sacrificed his life for something bigger than himself, never giving up on America's potential. As he once said, "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'" Really special to be at Black &amp; Gold Scholarship Gala last night, for the George Biddle Kelley Education Foundation. I was 1st recipient of the scholarship about 20 years ago. It was an honor to speak at the Gala to support the next generation &amp; celebrate importance of education. https://t.co/0O5FaUF80l “As the nation endures a lengthy partial government shutdown, newly-elected Congressman Antonio Delgado vows he'll listen to the concerns of everyone in New York's politically diverse 19th District.” Listen to my interview with @DianeDonatoFYI: https://t.co/T7I5l08rHm At Women March On! In Hudson, Lacey and I spoke about how in this challenging moment of time, w/ divisiveness coming from the Administration and the shutdown, it's especially powerful to celebrate the gains women made over the last year &amp; lay out the work ahead for all of us. https://t.co/Y3rRfiMG6G “Rep. Delgado says that some stores can no longer accept [SNAP] because the shutdown does not allow vendors to renew their SNAP licenses. In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Delgado urged that the licensing issue be remedied immediately.”
https://t.co/tQ1Idtxxjg “U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado has been appointed to the House Agriculture Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the two assignments he sought.”

https://t.co/CEhBRvu1Bs Shared with @CNN my legislative priorities, plans for town halls—and my favorite pump-up song and food in the district. Check it out: https://t.co/Z9ZoTNDiSc Inspiring to meet the young people behind March for Our Lives last night and hear their stories—successes and challenges alike—in their efforts to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/zkCSmOXwuq This weekend’s rally and march is an opportunity to celebrate the incredible work women did during the midterm elections to change the landscape of leadership in this country, and to recognize the continuing effort to advance women’s equality through civic engagement. Lacey and I are looking forward to joining March On! this weekend in Hudson. In the face of an administration that is moving us backwards on social justice, the groundswell of activism in our community has been a true bright spot. https://t.co/hC4N7UrAUb Giving big breaks to corporations while exploding the deficit is irresponsible and wrong at a time when so much wealth is in the hands of a few and wages remain stagnant for far too many hard-working Americans. https://t.co/OFtNlRIBxq It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that the tax bill pushed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress is not paying for itself. This type of privatization undermines the spirit and purpose of the VA. We owe it to our veterans to provide the best possible care, and these actions do not service that goal -- they only move us in the wrong direction: https://t.co/Y4Ye9Su3wG It was so great to be in Hudson today for the ceremonial swearing-in celebration. The only reason we were able to be here today is because of what all of you did to support our campaign. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. #NY19 https://t.co/JLpFTBJSSn Great to be a part of this @TIME feature on new Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/2clMkW1XzT https://t.co/smm9nvTeyD “Otsego County’s new congressman introduced his first bill. The bipartisan [bill]...would provide the surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran w/ federal contracting preference as a ‘Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business’ w/ the VA+the SBA.” https://t.co/gbrEOuFBii Farmers and businesses in Upstate New York who have already been hit hard because of the Trump Administration’s trade policies are now being hit again because of the reckless government shutdown. They deserve better. https://t.co/Y7eAW6nNyw “Rep. Delgado, a Democrat representing NY’s 19th Congressional District, ripped the government shutdown as ‘irresponsible’ &amp; insisted that the federal Department of Agriculture improve its communications on its plans for the food stamp program.” Read more: https://t.co/hDOBw83HXO With so many Americans getting by paycheck to paycheck, we simply cannot tolerate putting people’ livelihoods at risk over reckless partisanship. We must end the shutdown. https://t.co/jBP8rs37eX Happy birthday to the love of my life - an amazing woman, incredible wife and an absolute gift of a mother to our little boys. https://t.co/17HEgBl4Cs Being accountable to the people is what I will do day in and day out. It’s the first step towards changing the broken system in Washington that’s gotten in the way of progress for our district. https://t.co/ydBRpIgCn2 Joined @StopBigMoney today for a panel on the role of money in politics in elections and Congress. I’m proud to have run a different type of campaign, based on showing up and listening to folks across the district—and not taking a dime of corporate PAC money. RT @StopBigMoney: HAPPENING AT 2 PM ET: Tune in LIVE for ECU’s forum with @SpanbergerVA07, @DelgadoforNY19, @JasonCrowCO6, and @golden4cong… ”On the day he was sworn in last week, Delgado told reporters on a conference call that the situation in the Rensselaer County village was among his top regional concerns as the new House member for New York’s 19th District." Read more: https://t.co/jc4Gmszqzy "U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado is taking over the portfolio on easing water contamination in Hoosick Falls, and more broadly the fight to restore regulatory teeth to President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency... We are at the point now where districts are drawn so partisan that one’s party affiliation effectively renders the right to vote meaningless.

https://t.co/Td2tNZ9AYI Good to see that the Supreme Court will be reviewing these cases. Partisan gerrymandering is undermining our democracy, with lawmakers creating district lines that essentially disenfranchise citizens. In the campaign, we heard from folks about importance of reducing influence of money in politics. Great to see strong activism continue &amp; I’m proud to support HR1, which will help increase gov’t accountability to the people, not corporate special interests https://t.co/4H6b6H24tq “‘It’s always about how my decisions are going to impact the folks who sent me here.'

"His plan is to hold town halls in each of the district’s 11 counties by the end of the year. Delgado says he will offer robust constituent services."

More: https://t.co/aNpU52JLnm The morning of my swearing-in, I shared my goals as a Congressman for our district. “‘I think it’s important that anybody who goes to Congress puts their constituents first, and that should be the North Star. It is for me,' Delgado says.” Thank you for visiting my campaign Twitter. If your intention was to visit my official House of Representatives Twitter page, please visit @repdelgado. It was really special to have the boys with me in Congress today. Proud to be an example for them, and grateful for this opportunity. https://t.co/1ieA5abMjQ Just over a month ago, we picked out our office, and today my family and I went in together for the first time! Check it out: https://t.co/hCT7M4PVCU In DC today ahead of tomorrow’s swearing in, I got a chance to speak with PIX 11 about what my priorities will be in Congress, and our focus on getting our district offices up and running so folks have a place to go to voice their concerns and get their questions answered. https://t.co/2HaoqTATty It's telling that even the President's outgoing Chief of Staff acknowledged that a border wall is not what's needed for border security -- it's a political talking point and one that should not get in the way of re-opening the government. https://t.co/NpFETOsFxh The first task for Congress will be putting aside political games and re-opening the government. I hope that Democrats and Republicans alike can work together to do so. Reply with what you'd like me to focus on over the next year! 3/3 We’re finalizing plans to start things off strong by building up a robust operation throughout #NY19 &amp; getting to work on key priorities like expanding rural broadband, combating the opioid epidemic &amp; protecting our environment, including our water infrastructure. 2/3 Hope everyone had a wonderful New Year's Eve! With Congressional swearing-in on Thursday, I'm spending the day getting prepared. 1/3 Finishing the year counting our blessings and truly grateful. From my family to yours, Happy New Year! https://t.co/6XcR9SybCs I will continue to do all that I can to defend protections for those with pre-existing conditions and expand healthcare to everyone. It's deeply unfortunate and disappointing that at a time when we should be focused on providing universal affordable and accessible healthcare, this case could invalidate the ACA and destroy folks' options. Good news: While the ridiculous attacks on the ACA continue, with a lawsuit working its way through the court system, a federal judge ruled that the ACA will continue to be the law of the land in the interim, instead of being struck down immediately. https://t.co/DlrNh66Wff Great to see local conservation efforts like this one in Oneonta, that will support future farming as well as help to improve water quality and address climate change. https://t.co/PZp0KbLpOP We need to ensure local small businesses have the resources they need to grow, support local farmers, encourage job growth in key industries like renewable energy, and so much more. It's what I look forward to getting to work on in Congress. This economic growth in the Capital Region -- including the counties in our district -- is very encouraging. Yet as this piece points out, there's far more work to be done -- and increasing job opportunities across the board is one of my key priorities. https://t.co/7uerCK3fhK Great having a retreat at Scribner’s Lodge with the love of my life, reflecting and planning ahead of our new journey together. https://t.co/u3mhjyFpEf Cases of the flu are rapidly increasing in our area -- state health officials are encouraging folks to get the flu vaccine if you haven't already, and don't forget to wash your hands so we can contain further spreading. https://t.co/6ekqmqbj7G We need to reopen the government as quickly as possible so we can get to work on key priorities for folks here: curbing the influence of money in politics, combating the opioid epidemic, increasing broadband access, and more. This is incredibly disappointing and an indictment of the growing dysfunction in DC. https://t.co/7c0SsSpa4d Mountainside Residential Care Center in Margaretville is hosting a free dinner for seniors in the area -- it's in celebration of the holidays tomorrow night. More info here, including how to RSVP. Hope you'll share with seniors you know! https://t.co/tfn4EXlc2K This in-depth feature from @nytimes looks at the changes the Administration has made, and the real effects across the country. We are going in the wrong direction.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make environmental protections a priority. https://t.co/RbFv5pt5g4 Whether it's protecting against air and water pollution or taking on the challenge of climate change, we need to be doing more, not less, to keep our communities safe and vibrant for generations to come. While it's good that the agency has already announced new procedures in the face of his death, it is incumbent on the Administration and Congress alike to make sure they are followed and that not one more of these tragedies occurs. Amidst holiday celebrations across New York and the country came the somber news that a second child, 8-year-old boy Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, has died in the custody of Border Patrol. This is unconscionable. https://t.co/AATo2cbFUc It's been wonderful to spend time with my family this week, reflecting on the year we've had. I’m also so grateful for the opportunity to serve, and for all you have given to me and my family. Hope you're enjoying a holiday season full of love, joy, &amp; renewed hope in our future. https://t.co/hkF7YkPXqg This uncertainty is the last thing that federal employees in New York and across the country need right now, and Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle must find compromise no matter how difficult it may seem. (3/3) And while most services will continue for now, that won't be the case if the shutdown continues too much longer; agencies are already preparing for next steps. (2/3) The U.S. Senate adjourned yesterday, meaning the government shutdown will at the very least last through the holidays, requiring some of our most important federal workers around the holiday season -- including at TSA and CBP -- to work without pay. (1/3) https://t.co/f0DpSpGt0K Congress must step up and work on a bipartisan basis to fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to provide a check-and-balance on the Administration, putting our national interest ahead of party politics or other distractions. We must take seriously the threat of growing terrorism in Syria and Afghanistan, and President Trump's actions this week are out-of-line with the strong recommendations of national security leaders on both sides of the aisle. Important @timesunion editorial board piece this weekend about the resignation of Secretary Mattis. https://t.co/jnWCvOocCv It's great to see stories like this across the region this holiday season. What service projects are going on right now in your community? We'll share some highlights over the next week! https://t.co/gdTYbDuFD5 It's a sad state in our politics that these shutdowns have become seemingly routine. This is not remotely how a democracy is meant to function. For the good of the country, we must find ways to work together. The government officially shut down at midnight last night, with Congress and President Trump again leaving government funding decisions to the last second and failing to come to agreement. https://t.co/h3aorKDk1t Glad to see that the AVTT Traveling Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall will be coming to town next year. It's a powerful way to honor the veterans in our community, and they're already looking for volunteers if you're interested in getting involved. https://t.co/l8U81zc19b Additionally, Congress needs to provide appropriate oversight to ensure we're not alienating our allies or making reckless foreign policy decisions. This is all the more urgent in the face of Secretary Mattis' resignation. We need members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who don't leave consequential government funding decisions to the last minute over an ill-conceived and unjustified wall. It's been a tumultuous couple days in Congress &amp; the Administration, with an impending gov’t shutdown &amp; resignation of Secretary Mattis. While it's easy to turn our heads on what can seem like the latest political drama, these events have real consequences for #NY19 &amp; our country Thank you to the members of the Citizens Climate Lobby who sat down with me today -- it was great to have such an in-depth discussion about ways we can work together, regardless of political affiliation, on climate solutions that really work for communities here in Upstate NY. https://t.co/Cr1wAqQYjW This is clearly a complex issue that needs to be taken seriously, from addressing ticks in our environment, to increasing funding for research focused on Lyme disease detection, to working with doctors and the medical community on treatment. Had an informative meeting earlier today in Hyde Park with experts on Lyme disease and its effects on #NY19. https://t.co/8KZdc24lZe There's a lot Congress needs to do to reform our health care system in order to bring down costs -- but it's great to see record health care enrollment across the state. Missed the deadline? You still have options before January 31st https://t.co/jSUZvwnjnc It is a testament to the fact that Republican and Democratic lawmakers can still come together to get things done that this bill passed the Senate, and it looks likely that it will pass the House and be signed into law. I'm glad to see significant steps in the right direction included in this bill, ranging from protecting juveniles from cruel &amp; unusual punishment of solitary confinement, to ending the practice of shackling pregnant inmates, to addressing sentencing disparities for drug offenses. From my time as a lawyer working on pro bono cases in the criminal justice system, to conversations I've had throughout my life and especially during the campaign with people of our district, it's abundantly clear that criminal justice reform is necessary. https://t.co/LdhwK0mJFz Looking forward to joining the Ulster County Regional Chamber of Commerce on January 24th. More info here, and hope to see you there! https://t.co/FGOuExEN8q Tonight, the Reformed Church of Saugerties is bringing people together for a "Blue Christmas," supporting folks struggling this holiday season, whether they're missing a loved one or suffering from mental illness or addiction. (2/2)https://t.co/fXcOQbsxfI Too often, and especially around the holiday season, mental health issues are swept under the table. (1/2) Congress needs to act as well, working together to pass common sense gun safety legislation. This is the right thing to do. We saw at the horrific tragedy in Las Vegas the deadly harm bump stocks can cause by making an AR-15 fire like a machine gun. I'm glad the Trump Administration took this important action. https://t.co/6QRTq0X3ww RT @AN_Goldstein: Just wrapped up our first #NY19 Veterans Advisory Committee meeting with @DelgadoforNY19. I feel great about how he will… Also grabbed a picture at the end with Peter K. Goebel, Director of Unified Family Services' Veterans Service Agency of Rensselaer. Thanks to everyone who came out today, and to Veterans Advisory Committee member @AN_Goldstein for organizing. https://t.co/XlVXFdlCdZ Great to meet with veterans from across #NY19 today. We're focused on what can be done to get results for veterans here in our district. We discussed everything from improving health care for rural veterans to ensuring veterans have access to the benefits they've earned. Glad that these refunds are included in the Farm Bill. We need to do more to support dairy farmers in Upstate New York, and it'll be one of my priorities in Congress. 
https://t.co/cGxoB993l9 Love seeing local neighbors helping neighbors this holiday season. https://t.co/SPVhEJqVd2 Reminder to New Yorkers that you can still enroll in health insurance through January 31st, 2019. Don't forget to #getcovered! https://t.co/wrxD1bJN5y This is an undemocratic attack on the ACA and on protections for people with pre-existing conditions. We should be working together to achieve quality, affordable healthcare for everyone, not taking it away. 
https://t.co/sbEFzUXUFL A year of detailed reporting &amp; scientific evidence reminding us that #climatechange is very real and that the U.S. should be leading on protecting our environment and transitioning to renewable energy sources.  
https://t.co/1iAgN3jNZG We must stay focused on expanding affordable healthcare to everyone and no longer remain the only developed country in the world without some form of universal coverage. We will not tolerate this total disregard for the will of the people and reckless, unabashed attack on the public good. And now, with this ruling, people are forced to live in fear over whether or not they will be covered because of a few in power who prioritize private profit-seeking behavior at the expense of our democratic principles. All across the country and throughout the midterms we heard from people who want to expand healthcare coverage by making it more accessible and affordable, while keeping the ACA in place to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.  
https://t.co/LTg9gXKExp Warming center at AME Zion Church in Kingston offers shelter from the cold and has been made possible by members of the community committed to helping others. 
https://t.co/GL5flwq8Hk A reminder New Yorkers have one more day to sign up for healthcare insurance to ensure they are covered on January 1. Open enrollment is underway now through January 31. 
https://t.co/JRKHprmOhe I'm proud to work on the implementation of programs that will benefit our #NY19 farmers and will continue working to ensure Farm Bill subsidies help farmers truly in need of assistance and in support of our young farmers as well as small and medium size farms. The #2018FarmBill also includes funding for local farmers market grants, research funds for organic farming, and money for organizations working to train the next generation of farmers. The bipartisan #2018FarmBill provides much needed relief to dairy farmers, preserves the Conservation Stewardship Program and eliminates the proposed increased work requirements for SNAP recipients. 
https://t.co/0dzHrQK2rb We need to focus on bipartisan solutions to the opioid crisis that prioritize funding to expand access to treatment while increasing education and outreach, especially in rural areas. 
https://t.co/T9yXftfsqh Thank you to everyone for coming out and talking with us in Middleburgh last weekend! Looking forward to staying engaged and having conversations with all constituents in #NY19. https://t.co/VqPoNqBZvN "In his first post-election Sullivan appearance, Delgado spoke briefly, thanking all in attendance for their support and hard work on his behalf.

https://t.co/JwVfD2CrGY RT @DailyFreeman: U.S. Rep.-elect Antonio Delgado names district director https://t.co/fnBlGZGfSw We should be doing everything possible to help our children get healthcare coverage yet states refusing Medicaid expansion, a reduction in funding of advertising for ACA health plans or the government delaying the renewal of funding for CHIP have all made it more difficult. Last year, the number of U.S. children without health insurance jumped by 276,000 — to 3.9 million, up from a low of 3.6 million in 2016. It was the first increase in the number of uninsured children in America since 2008.

All are welcome! More info here: https://t.co/Rk7ryMIvgK Our third week of freshman orientation has come to an end. I've learned a lot about improving constituent services, how to set up offices at home and in Washington to best serve #NY19 and have gotten to know my fellow new members. Listen to the first part of our interview with @AlanChartock on @WAMCNews Congressional Corner here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/B8GjkL37UC Today we remember the 2,403 people who lost their lives 77 years ago at the attack on Pearl Harbor and we give thanks to our veterans for their brave service defending our country. 
https://t.co/3nux8LlhnF Donations from local farmers have helped provide an estimated 9 million meals. https://t.co/RdGOv7jm5M Today @Harvard we talked about strategies for improving constituent services, economic growth policies, lowering prescription drug prices and heard a very inspirational message from Nobel laureate @Malala. @JFKJrForum #MalalaForum https://t.co/gVrYK2ltUp Our female veterans deserve equal treatment for their service &amp; sacrifice to our country. We should be prioritizing availability &amp; accessibility of healthcare services for female veterans at VA facilities &amp; passing legislation like the Deborah Sampson Act.https://t.co/8JplZ2ykJE Great to see students at @SUNY_Oneonta improve their financial literacy skills and prepare for careers after college. https://t.co/olBf3VEjdR Excited to be elected vice-chair of #FutureForum with @RepStephMurphy as chair and vice co-chairs @Abby4Iowa &amp; @RepJimmyGomez. Looking forward to taking a leadership role on the needs of our younger generation from loan forgiveness to access to land and capital for young farmers. https://t.co/oyyTsHMRlY Met this young lady, Keziah Clarke, tonight at the @JFKLibrary. She grew up in Hyde Park and is currently a junior at @Harvard as well as the chair of the JFK Junior Forum at the @Kennedy_School. Great to see #NY19 represented here! https://t.co/S7r2NutNby Very upsetting to see this type of blatant disregard for the will of the people.  Nakedly partisan power grabs like this have no place in a democracy. https://t.co/XSCzgZCpTa I’m here to serve the entire community and make sure you can have faith again in democracy and representation.

This community understands it’s not left or right, but right and wrong.
https://t.co/fHR77FSFK9 Great to be back at Harvard where @laceyschwartz and I first met for the Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress! https://t.co/C8SZdoHgzC Thank you to everyone who came out to Catskill last night to show appreciation for volunteers and talk about the issues impacting upstate New York. Looking forward to talking with people in Rhinebeck, Monticello and Middleburgh this weekend. Celebrated the dedication and hard work of our volunteers tonight in Catskill. Looking forward to representing everyone in #NY19 and committed to serving every constituent. https://t.co/Ir3jfagmip We have got to work together to make healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone. No one should be forced wipe out their savings or go into debt to pay for healthcare coverage. More than 11 million Americans took on added credit card debt in 2013 to cover medical expenses. 15 million depleted their savings to pay for medical bills. Another 10 million were unable to pay for basic necessities, including rent, food and utilities, because of medical bills. Think about the facts behind this act of kindness --- more than 1 in 3 Americans say they struggle to afford the cost of medical care, with 43 million now owing $75 billion in past-due medical debt.

We must continue bipartisan efforts to both stop the distribution of opioids and help people receive treatment for addiction. The opioid crisis has impacted countless families and communities. Our focus must be on ending this public health crisis. 
https://t.co/1G1ysDxIZe As we light the first candle tonight, wishing everyone a very Happy Hanukkah! https://t.co/ttmoN5KDrJ I strongly support #EqualPay, passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid family leave. It's completely unacceptable that anyone is paid less for the same work because of their gender. https://t.co/BTtSSGXMxe The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years. The hottest 4 have come in the past 4 years. We can't wait to act on climate change &amp; should be thinking about our future by investing in renewable energy &amp; protecting our environment. https://t.co/OsKSZxNueS Having a great time with the boys at the Sinterklaas Festival parade in Rhinebeck! https://t.co/BUwqyGvV0c Looking forward to seeing everyone in Catskill on Monday evening to thank volunteers for their dedicated support and talk with everyone about issues important to the people of #NY19. More info here: https://t.co/luHlZFFCrR We had a big week in Washington - met as a Democratic caucus to vote on leadership and discuss issues for the 116th Congress then finally, to select our new offices. Very glad to be back in #NY19 before heading to Boston next week for new member orientation at Harvard. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family. We extend our condolences and remember Former President George H. W. Bush’s dedicated service to the American people. https://t.co/WcxnmztaqB We did it! Got our new office on Capitol Hill! Looking forward to welcoming #NY19 constituents and focusing on the issues that will bring positive change to upstate New York. We did this by working together and I’m so honored to serve everyone in our district. https://t.co/iO0xigatBj This is another attempt to undermine and dismantle the ACA by offering healthcare plans that cover less and offer fewer protections. We need quality and affordable healthcare for everyone with plans that provide coverage for essential healthcare needs. https://t.co/qXvOBiiK9M Today is the day new members get our office assignments in Washington. Are you following us on Instagram? Check out our story to see the lottery and search for our new office! https://t.co/kyhcO0YBBW We must come together to stand up against hate and build on the understanding that our diversity - whether it's religion, nationality, race or gender - is one of our greatest strengths as a country. I strongly condemn any expression of hate, including this horrifying act. This rise in hate crimes and anti-Semitism is vile, goes against our values as Americans and will not be tolerated. https://t.co/3EoCdI9Qcz Great meeting with my fellow members of the New York delegation - ready to get to work! https://t.co/EiSuMMsdIr Drug overdoses killed more than 70,000 Americans in 2017 - a record - and are also the leading cause of death for adults under 55. We need bipartisan solutions like better funding for treatment centers, education and outreach, especially in rural areas. https://t.co/U1TVP57Z6W RT @rollcall: “People are tired of divisiveness and want substance ... and they want to believe again that this system can actually represe… We should never leave our veterans short. They and their families sacrifice too much to ever be left behind. https://t.co/nbhnGSxkqR It's extremely important that we ensure clean drinking water and help communities that have been forced to endure a crisis of contaminated water. I look forward to working together with @RepDanKildee of Michigan on passing legislation that protects our communities from water contamination. Rep. Kildee came to Hoosick Falls and talked to residents about his response in Flint. https://t.co/AWRYG181vi
