Given recent developments, I believe that it is best for the Commonwealth of Virginia if Justin Fairfax dealt with these accusations as a private citizen. He can no longer serve us as the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. This week as I began service on the @EnergyCommerce committee, it was clear that the spirit and legacy of @JohnDingell lived on through our work. Rep. John Dingell is a legendary public servant who will be sorely missed. Thank you @RevYearwood and @Kingdomliving4u for the longstanding partnership and your unwavering commitment to #ActOnClimate. Minority communities deserve equal representation as we discuss #environmentaljustice solutions. I have worked hard to ensure that we have more voices of color as we discuss energy and environment issues. That is why I co-founded the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force. The fact is that communities of color are disproportionately impacted by environmental injustices that can harm their public health and economic livelihoods. Having voices from these communities at the table is critical. I have worked with @RevYearwood and @Kingdomliving4u throughout my tenure in Congress. Here are two prominent leaders on the front lines in our communities as we fight for #environmentaljustice across the country. On behalf of the @OfficialCBC Environmental and Agriculture Task Force, I am thrilled to see two friends serve as witnesses for the first #climatechange hearings in 6 years. @RevYearwood @KingdomLiving4u https://t.co/oyGGVXvf4I Thank you, Petty Officer Second Class Megan Winters for joining me as my guest for last night’s #SOTU address.

Now in 2019, we continue to see far too many African-Americans struggle from the systemic racism that began 400 years ago in Jamestown. On this first day of #BlackHistoryMonth, we commemorate the first Africans who were brought here to Virginia as slaves in 1619 - 400 years ago. My @NRDems colleagues and I are interested in hearing your #ClimateChangeImpactsMe stories. We know that #climatechange directly impacts Americans across the country – as it is making our wildfires bigger, floods worse and hurricanes stronger. How have you been impacted by climate change? You can share your #ClimateChangeImpactsMe story at https://t.co/ZdgKoKOjq8. I am thrilled to continue fighting #forthepeople under the leadership of Chairman @RepRaulGrijalva as a member of @NRDems. I am proud to now represent the 4th Congressional District on the Energy and Mineral Resources and Oversight and Investigations subcommittees. https://t.co/7uyOEskKDL I introduced the Election Day Holiday Act w/ @RepAnnaEshoo because we must do all we can to remove barriers to the ballot box for American citizens. The right to vote is sacred and should be  protected. Our democracy depends on this fundamental principle. https://t.co/Rh4dc6WRsM The US wind industry just finished the third best quarter in its history, which means the country runs on more affordable, reliable, clean wind energy than ever before. We must invest in #renewableenergy! 
https://t.co/Rkg1IoQ0yk It has been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law – but our work is not done. That is why I proudly joined my fellow @HouseDemocrats in reintroducing the #PaycheckFairness Act. https://t.co/7QyG0PiV5c The Rebuild America’s School Act helps not only our students, but also our economy. By investing more than $100 billion in school infrastructure, this bill would create 1.9 million good-paying jobs for local workers. #BuildSchoolsNotWalls Every student, regardless of their family’s wealth, should have access to a safe, welcoming, and high-quality public school. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. #BuildSchoolsNotWalls The Rebuild America’s School Act would invest more than $100 billion to improve public schools across the country.  #BuildSchoolsNotWalls Countless students attend school in crumbling buildings that are unsafe and not equipped with essential resources. This is simply unacceptable. I joined our fellow Virginian, Chairman @BobbyScott, in introducing the #RebuildAmericasSchools Act so that we can invest money in our public schools to address critical physical and digital infrastructure needs in schools across the country. I am honored to have earned a perfect 100+ on the Humane scorecard from the @HSLegFund. 

https://t.co/b0XoRarcae We must act on climate now. Not only does climate change threaten public health and life as we know - but it also impacts our national security. https://t.co/NE8XUoVv1l We must continue the fight to protect our one Earth and renew our commitment to strengthening the protections enacted. I urge this administration to empower the @EPA and @Interior to fulfill their missions to protect our waters, our lands, and all Americans, and stop their relentless attack on the commonsense safeguards enacted to protect us. Unlike the current administration, I will never stop defending our coasts, which is why I have twice introduced the bipartisan Defend our Coast Act. https://t.co/LNntmzr92R Climate science and history continue to show us that #offshoredrilling is simply irresponsible and wrong for our environment. Today marks the 50th anniversary of the catastrophic oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. #SantaBarbaraOilSpill  https://t.co/7PtLUs392J The suffering and deprivation we have seen across the country clearly demonstrated that a #shutdown is not the answer to any disagreement. Contrary to what President Trump said at the end of his speech, a #shutdown should never be the solution or even an option when governing. Everyone must be committed to finding a resolution without threatening or enacting another shutdown. The President owes these Americans an apology for being hostages to his intransigence. Fortunately, 800,000 federal workers will soon be back on the job, receiving long overdue paychecks so that they can pay their bills and feed their families. Negotiating policy differences can be done without closing the government, without depriving dedicated workers of their paychecks, and certainly without depriving Americans of needed services. President Trump and his Republican colleagues finally recognize the overdue necessity of re-opening the government after the 35th day of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/NNIlqd0yaO RT @NRDems: Throughout the 30+ day #TrumpShutdown, @Interior has continued to approve oil &amp; gas permits, plan for lease sales, and hold oil… It is a shame that while the government has been shut down for the past 34 days. Most @Interior employees are home, unable to do their jobs or answer public questions. However, oil and gas permitting is still going strong. #TrumpShutdown Here are the two sides of the #TrumpShutdown:
1⃣Federal workers forced to stay home and struggling to pay their bills.
2⃣Oil and gas companies: continuing the Trump Administration's #dirtyenergy policy business as usual.

https://t.co/i2pt4SMpUd . @SecretaryRoss does not understand why furloughed federal workers would not go get loans: “So the 30 days of pay that some people will be out, there is no real reason why they shouldn’t be able to get a loan against it.” This should not be a discussion. 
https://t.co/k1A5V22jDZ I am incredibly concerned by the comments made by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. More than 800,000 federal employees are struggling to make ends meet and provide for their family. The Ross Solution: Get a loan. It is beyond time to #EndTheShutdown. RT @AppropsDems: Today, @realDonaldTrump's Secretary of Commerce said he doesn't understand why federal workers are needing to go to food b… The Trump Administration is collectively ignorant and uninformed about the real-world challenges the 800,000 federal employees are facing during the #TrumpShutdown. @SecretaryRoss Sec. Ross clearly showed the American people the blatant disregard and disconnect between this administration and hardworking Americans. I have volunteered to distribute food multiple times this month. My constituents are concerned that there is no end in sight to this #TrumpShutdown. Billionaire @SecretaryRoss seems confused. He claims he does not understand why furloughed, unpaid federal workers are lining up at food banks when they can just go get a loan. https://t.co/3Ug4x3ZUWa As a lawmaker, I will do everything I can to ensure that brave transgender Americans can continue to enlist and serve their nation honorably and with distinction. While I remain hopeful that ongoing litigation will prevail and defeat this misguided policy in the courts, Congress must be ready to intervene. The decision to allow the Trump Administration to proceed with implementation of its discriminatory transgender servicemembers ban is extremely disappointing. https://t.co/dyFERZOK7J This administration’s shameful and baseless policy not only insults thousands of transgender individuals currently serving in our armed forces, but also hurts military readiness by denying us the service of brave and skillful patriots.  https://t.co/UQcYme6AW5 Today marks the 46th anniversary of the #RoevWade decision. I proudly support this landmark law and vow to continue fighting against any threats to weaken a woman's access to high-quality healthcare and family planning.

Let us never give up and not be discouraged. As Dr. King so eloquently said, "The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice." His legacy is our responsibility. Today, as we honor the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are all reminded that we have a long way to go until we achieve his dream of a world where people are judged by their character, not the color of their skin. #MLKDay Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama! Your tireless advocacy for all women and children is incredibly inspiring. You are a true role model. 27 days of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they will cover their basic costs of living, like rent &amp; groceries. It is time to #EndTheShutdown. No individual who works full-time, year-round should live in poverty. It’s time to #RaiseTheWage. Researchers estimate that just a 10% increase would drive up consumer spending by $2 billion a year. #RaiseTheWage 📈 The #RaiseTheWage Act would put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. This bill is good for workers, good for businesses, and good for the economy. I am proud to cosponsor Chairman @BobbyScott’s #RaiseTheWage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 and give roughly 40 million Americans a well-deserved raise. I hope that this commonsense legislation will pass the House and Senate. https://t.co/8hRvR1Fn3e You can watch the @EPWDems hearing #LIVE here: https://t.co/NZITZI4Jq1 We need an EPA Chief who will uphold the @EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. #StopWheeler While @EPA workers face another day without pay because of the #TrumpShutdown, @EPAAWheeler is defending his harmful #dirtyenergy policies in front of @EPWDems. https://t.co/Guad3IdEFs It is time for Acting @EPA Administrator @EPAAWheeler to answer for leading the Trump Administration’s #dirtyenergy agenda. https://t.co/Gsrbd2kpkP New studies show sea levels may rise much more quickly than we anticipated.

For federal employees, with no paycheck in sight, this is a scary time as they worry about paying bills and meeting basic obligations. They deserve better. #TrumpShutdown Hourly, non-union federal workers, who often live paycheck to paycheck, can least afford these days and weeks without pay just so President Trump can try to prove a point about a needless wall. #TrumpShutdown Today marks the 45th Anniversary of the Endangered Species Act! We must continue working to protect our planet and all of its inhabitants. Wishing you and your loved ones a very Happy Kwanzaa! https://t.co/0dx4EJ4G0b Wishing you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas. https://t.co/LVT6068SMn It is so unfortunate that instead of preparing for a joyous holiday and spending time with their families, federal workers are worrying about missing a paycheck.
