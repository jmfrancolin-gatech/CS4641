It concentrates power in the hands of those special interests that can afford to cut a big check and buy the election results they want. It takes power away from individual people. .@RonWyden: Colleagues, the dark money rule change feeds right into this system of malignant, secretive politics that Americans are sick of. And it gets to the heart of a larger problem. Across the country, our right to vote, our elections, and our democracy are under assault. .@RonWyden: Colleagues, one thing is clear to me from my conversations with voters in Oregon this election season. What voters DO NOT want is more secret spending from more anonymous wealthy donors and foreigners leading to more political advertising. .@RonWyden: If the dark money rule change is no big deal then why did the Trump admin work so hard to block the Congress from challenging it? They keep the rule change off the official books for as long as they could, presumably hoping to run out the clock on our oversight. .@RonWyden: I take a back seat to nobody on the issue of privacy rights in America. But allowing foreigners and mega-wealthy corporations to buy elections in secrecy is not a matter of privacy -- it‚Äôs a position of anti-democracy. .@RonWyden: Now, since this is a tax policy change, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, where we do a lot of work on issues dealing with tax exemptions. But let‚Äôs make one thing clear -- this change got no debate in the Finance Committee. .@RonWyden: Even if the IRS and state tax authorities suspect a particular spending group is guilty of wrongdoing, they won‚Äôt know who provided its cash. .@RonWyden: Shadowy political spending groups used to be required under tax laws to disclose the identities of their major donors. After this recent change they won‚Äôt have to disclose at all. .@RonWyden: Hours after the majority of the public heard Butina‚Äôs name for the first time the Trump admin dropped its dark money bombshell, announcing a new policy that would allow even more untraceable dark money from foreigners &amp; special interests to infiltrate our elections. .@RonWyden: She cultivated relationships with political insiders.

She came to the U.S. years earlier and set out infiltrating conservative organizations, principally the NRA. .@RonWyden: But the rule change the Trump administration pushed through this summer is all about darkness.

Instead of threatening cuts to critical benefits that seniors rely on, lawmakers should be working hard to improve the system &amp; deliver better, more accessible care. Americans get their Medicare in many ways: traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, as well as new systems like Independence at Home and Accountable Care Organizations. These benefits make a real difference for senior‚Äôs quality of life, while saving taxpayer dollars. Medicare's guarantee of quality health benefits for seniors needs to keep up with the times.

Today‚Äôs announcement also streamlines complicated rules for Special Needs Plans (SNPs) within Medicare Advantage, that tailor their care to low-income and chronically-ill patients. That means better care for those who need it most. Starting soon, seniors with Medicare Advantage plans can use more telehealth services, getting better access to their physician and the care that they need. That means fewer trips to the doctor.
