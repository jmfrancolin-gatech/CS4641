Let our heroes know they aren't alone &amp; let's get them the help they need. #LA05 https://t.co/5FU5VCdm8d Congress should censure Maxine Waters for her uncivilized and dangerous call to harass Trump officials. As the new face of the left, her supporters will use her words to justify violence &amp; intimidation to get their way. We can't allow that behavior. #LA05 https://t.co/iBuf92jwW1 Great meeting today w/ @Grambling1901 SGA President Adarian Williams, who is interning in DC. We talked about the $2.2 million grant GSU received to help train students for STEM jobs. Thanks for the great discussion! #GramFam #LA05 https://t.co/k2wZcbY9cC This is a tremendous win for religious liberty and the freedom of speech. California's law directly attacked both by going after these #Prolife pregnancy centers, and the Supreme Court was right to rule in favor of @NIFLA. #NIFLAvBecerra #LA05 https://t.co/VdYCepydVz The Supreme Court made the right call here. The United States has every right to determine who enters our country, and there is no reason we should open the gates for people without thoroughly vetting them for security threats first. #LA05 https://t.co/qJns7cETnf Today, Congress wrapped up two weeks full of legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, the crisis next door for millions of American communities. The final bill passed was H.R. 6, which is one of the most important bills dedicated to addressing the opioid crisis. https://t.co/V5nEQkRUJp Over the last six months, we’ve seen countless benefits of tax reform. This was a much needed change and I’m proud of what it’s done for Louisiana and the rest of America. https://t.co/cVfebSamNh It’s Take Your Dog to Work Day, so Gunnar decided to pay us a visit.

Very important to give the agriculture… Great day for America’s farmers! No bill means more for ag policy than the #2018FarmBill. It will allow farmers to plan for the long-term success of their businesses and rural America. This bill works better for the farmer and the American people. #LA05 https://t.co/wWvBCsgP14 Congratulations to this young man, who grew up back home in #LA05. You make Louisiana and #LSU proud. #GeauxTigers https://t.co/EGNUf1S1KG I'm a proud cosponsor of #SAFA Goodlatte-McCaul bill. It prevented amnesty, funded the wall, ended chain migration &amp; cracked down on sanctuary cities. I'm disappointed it failed today but will continue to work to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system. #LA05 Don’t separate the families, but again don’t enter the country illegally either. Stop them at the border, send them back to their country as a family unit. Certainly do not send those children up to our border without their parents accompanying them. #LA05
https://t.co/43dh0JLCOb Our farmers are our thin green line - the ability to grow our own food is certainly a national security asset. Hopefully we'll pass the #FarmBill2018 this week that will allow our farmers the opportunity to plan and be successful in their businesses. #LA05 https://t.co/PIUyvT9bZX Great to see Steve back in the game. Remarkable recovery for a great leader and friend. https://t.co/EDqZA3qezz IG report confirms Comey &amp; his agents abused their positions to - as one agent put it - "stop Trump" from becoming President. Corruption at DoJ must be rooted out so Americans can again have faith in the institutions that should be objective, above politics. #DrainTheSwamp #LA05 Proud to be a cosponsor of the House version of this bill. I look forward to voting on it very soon. https://t.co/wl0UwsAlTB RT @USArmy: #DYK

Chennault's Flying Tigers. Men like him are why we live in freedom. I thank him &amp; all those who served. #LA05 #ArmyBday https://t.co/KPOqtkyK2T Today we recognize #FlagDay, and few celebrate the Stars and Stripes as well as the folks in Winnsboro, Louisiana. Patriot Square along Hwy. 15 can fly up to 300 flags, including a 40 ft x 75 ft flag that just can't be missed unless you were trying. #LA05 https://t.co/dFvYcUT8bt A denuclearized North Korea means a safer world for everyone. Hopefully, even President Trump's critics can pause their animosity long enough to recognize that the progress America is making on this front is good for all of us. #LA05 https://t.co/J9YvUKBdG9 Great meeting @USCG Commandant Karl Schultz. He's an outstanding leader.

I am thankful to have folks like Jerret &amp; Taylor who work tirelessly in our communities every day to help save lives. #LA05 Once again, President Trump has shown his great leadership skills on a world stage by obtaining North Korea’s commitment to denuclearize. The global community can breathe easier this morning. Stay tuned! #LA05 Thanks to the Louisiana Baptist Message for this great story about my mother-in-law, Nancy Johnston, who has been playing the organ at our church, Alto Baptist, for 70 years! #LA05 https://t.co/GjjLFhwLI3 Last week, the House passed an appropriations bill that provides the resources our VA needs to deliver the high-quality health care that our veterans deserve. #LA05 https://t.co/uGuVgiywMQ #Louisiana is rich in culture &amp; history.

Please join me in thanking them for their service. #LA05 https://t.co/zX5cooE9UW Today, President Trump signed the VA Missions Act into law. This bill is a huge win for veterans everywhere and helps give them full access to the care they have earned and deserve. #LA05 https://t.co/UogKIUwbEm Happy to announce that @Grambling1901 will receive a $2.2 million grant  to develop STEM programs. STEM jobs are the jobs of the future, and I want Louisiana students filling them. This grant will benefit Grambling's students and our region. #LA05

Maybe now the other chamber will have time to consider the 471 bills the House has passed that have stalled because of Democrat obstruction. #LA05 It was great having the Louisiana Nursing Home Association in the office today. I appreciate their advocacy for ensuring that our seniors get the care they deserve. #LA05 https://t.co/5dMqM1JYrz .@TFTenney touched the lives of thousands across the globe.

https://t.co/lxcfI56FoO Thank you to the Ruston Kiwanis Club for letting me speak today at their luncheon. I enjoyed giving them an update on what I'm working on in Congress and hearing all the exciting things they are doing to give back to the city. #LA05 https://t.co/OtqdhNhTUk It was great to be at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Oak Grove’s newest walking trail today. Thanks to Mayor Adam Holland and Sheriff Jerry Philley for all your hard work in completing this project. #LA05 https://t.co/itRKmZOQHQ Last week, Congress passed the #FY19NDAA and gave our military the highest pay raise in nine years.  This was just one of 648 bills that the 115th Congress has passed out of the House this session, making it the most productive Congress of the last four administrations. #LA05 https://t.co/fa5o2hnDZq We wrapped up Memorial Day with a service at the Ponemah Cemetery in Bogalusa. Today’s services were a reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by our military to protect our country. Thank you to our servicemen &amp; women everywhere for defending our freedom. https://t.co/7LfoQCOBdD Wonderful service today in Alexandria, LA for Memorial Day.

Harvel Lee Moore who was killed during World War II. The service was a reminder of the sacrifices our military, and their families, make for our country.

Moore &amp; his family. https://t.co/Zo6G4C2U5Z The @AmericanLegion &amp; Congress recognize May 25 as National Poppy Day, where Americans don a red poppy to represent those who sacrificed their lives while protecting our freedom.
