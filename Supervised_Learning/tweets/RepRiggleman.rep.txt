He will also post a video reaction following the State of the Union on Facebook and Twitter. It was heartbreaking to hear of the death of VSP Trooper Lucas B. Dowell.  We mourn his loss and honor his heroism.  I hope everyone will join me in praying for him and his family in this difficult time.  Rest in Peace. https://t.co/ydwL8aT0pG Check out my interview on the Daily Signal Podcast-

It is always a pleasure to meet with constituents and heroes in #VA05. https://t.co/Muf1V5Awkm "This has gone beyond party politics, and this is not a political issue." Riggleman said. "This is a human issue.  People need to say we're sick of racism."

He is responsible f‚Ä¶ RT @BrentScher: Just got off a call with Virginia congressman @Denver4VA, who called for @RalphNortham to resign yesterday. He is unequivoc‚Ä¶ I would not accept this behavior or this apology from an employee in my business, and I expect more from my Governor.  @GovernorVA, your actions remain unacceptable and I call on you again to resign. https://t.co/HkeOkhvq1m .@GovernorVA your apology is hollow. This type of behavior can not be tolerated at any level. You need to resign. @timburchett Thank you, my friend As a Virginian &amp; Rep. of Charlottesville, @GovernorVA yearbook photos hit more than a nerve. This Virginian demands an explanation. Now. Issues of racial discrimination cannot be taken lightly &amp; this type of behavior is dangerous &amp; unacceptable in any form

https://t.co/cUVggAp1eC As an veteran, I have the highest respect for those who gave their lives in service of this country.  I join 20 other members of Congress in signing this letter which calls for reversing the policy banning visitors from displaying the U.S. Flag at Arlington National Cemetary. https://t.co/CrJPd4L6BD We are united in our opposition to this bill. We reject this as a blatant attack on human life that allows easy abortions up until the point of birth. This assault on the most vulnerable among us is both heartbreaking and abhorrent. #HB2481
@RobWittman @RepBenCline @RepMGriffith https://t.co/XJ5pXCrVGT RT @RobWittman: The Virginia Congressional GOP Delegation stands united against the abhorrent bill introduced in the VA House that strips r‚Ä¶ Honored to be named Vice-Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy and will also serve on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions. https://t.co/JKJoetvyvX It is an honor to be selected to serve on these prestigious subcommittees.

Why didn't it pass? Dems voted no.

#VA05 Please watch video of my floor speech from this morning.  Wintergreen is facing fire safety issues and there is potential for a public safety risk. Government should assist not interfere.  Guidelines that don't make sense should be changed so "common sense" prevails #va05 https://t.co/zInWCkPSP4 .@SpeakerPelosi wants to cancel the #SOTU2019 citing the Secret Services' need for a physical barrier, technology, and increased personnel.  Ironic, isn't the government closed because she is refusing to do the same for our borders? Hypocrisy and partisan politics at its finest.

We discussed the start to his political career,‚Ä¶ As a small business owner, I learned firsthand the problems that are caused by overreaching government regulation.  On this committee, I will fight for the economic freedom of consumers and small businesses across the 5th district.
#VA05 I am honored by this appointment and thankful for the opportunity to serve the 5th district on the House Financial Services Committee.

Hate based on skin color has no place in the United States. Sign up for a #VA05 Congressional Internship in Congressman Riggleman's office.

We need physical barriers, multi-layered technology and a larger DHS presence. Then let‚Äôs move to visa reform and bringing our pathway to citizenship into the 21st century. It‚Äôs just common sense. #VA05 @ccl_virginia Thank you! The State of Virginia has declared a state of emergency regarding the winter weather today and tomorrow.

Thanks for contacting me and I look forward to our discussion. #VA05 It is going to be a challenge for any new Republican coming in to be bipartisan, but I am going to try.

As long as it meets the balance of the Constitution, is liberty based, and meets the needs of the 5th District, I am happy to be bipartisan. #VA05

https://t.co/3sk4EJDQzv https://t.co/EWSZ11AAQF I voted for a bill today that guarantees government employees will see their full paychecks when the shutdown ends.  I am working to find a bipartisan immigration solution to end the shutdown, but we shouldn't punish government employees because a deal hasn't been reached. This morning I met with Mick Mulvaney and the @WhiteHouse Legislative Affairs team.  We are working hard to find a solution to this partial #GovernmentShutdown Yesterday, I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives about the impact of opioids on the 5th district and why it is necessary for us to act to stop this crisis #VA05 https://t.co/diGuWok1Rc Please watch video of my first Congressional floor speech from this afternoon, covering the opioid crisis and law enforcement. #va05 https://t.co/FFedNkC0EA Watch LIVE now: https://t.co/vyVJNDuD0D

We have a real crisis at the border because partisan politics is put before real solutions. Years of gridlock on border security has created an untenable humanitarian situation.

Instead, I will donate my check to Drakes Branch Volunteer Fire Department in Charlotte Co. They were recently devastated by Hurricane Michael. Their community came together after an awful tragedy. We can learn from them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to live with integrity, live through transparency, and run things that are completely ethical...So my promise to the 5th District constituency is this: I will run an office that is pretty much on level with no ethical violations ever.‚Äù #VA05
