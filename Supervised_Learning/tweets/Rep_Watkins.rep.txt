The Fieldhouse was absolutely electric today! Great view, great game, and great company with @KUnews Chancellor Doug Girod! 

#RockChalk https://t.co/EpYT7toOcy This week I introduced H.R. 1061, which will modify and enhance the boundary and mission of the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Fort Scott, Kansas.

I thank my Kansas House colleagues for joining me in support of this important piece of legislation. 

https://t.co/RtH2R50qFi Amen! https://t.co/EJ7y30LElD Enjoyed getting to chat with Ranking Member Rep. @virginiafoxx today. Thanks for swinging by my office! 

For those who don‚Äôt know, @virginiafoxx is our phenomenal Republican Leader of the Ed &amp; Labor Committee. We‚Äôre lucky to have such a strong Representative leading the charge! https://t.co/OVgfcgo6qe It was an honor to meet with M.K. Nava Boker, the Deputy Speaker of Knesset. Now more than ever it is essential for the U.S. to be a strong ally of Israel. Rest assured, I will always be a strong proponent of Israel and her interests. https://t.co/7G12Gc5s59 Today, I introduced my first piece of legislation with the support of the entire Kansas House delegation. H.R. 1061 will modify and enhance the boundary and mission of the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Fort Scott, Kansas.

Thanks for coming by! https://t.co/O4rvU09Lr7 RT @EdLaborGOP: Republican Leader @virginiafoxx talks with tipped workers who would lose their jobs in a $15 fed min wage hike. Oddly, they‚Ä¶ Big thanks to the National Rural Health Association and the @kansashospitals Association for coming by my office to talk rural healthcare yesterday! https://t.co/PUh6ZC10aU Each morning @RepMullin gathers this group of bipartisan legislators and leads one of the toughest workouts around. 

Great workout and even better people! üí™üí™ https://t.co/SuNpKZ8NDj On this day in 1911, an American hero was born. When President Reagan spoke of a shining city on a hill, I felt like he was talking about Topeka. He inspired me to join the Army and eventually run for office. Reagan‚Äôs legacy will live on - and he will always be an inspiration. ‚ÄúThe Republicans have come forward to negotiate in full faith and transparency and I‚Äôd like to see the same from the dems,‚Äù Watkins said.

We have 9 more days until another shutdown. We‚Äôve yet to receive a proposal from House Democrats. 

https://t.co/nuy0qyu9CD Getting briefed by my staff at the beginning of a busy day of Congressional Committee work! https://t.co/pRHjpArJSZ We must come together - both as a nation, and as a body. Tonight, the President outlined a path forward, not for a Party, but for a nation. 

Watch my #SOTU2019 reaction below. https://t.co/3255X0jLUR Instead of watching the Jayhawks beat the Wildcats tonight, @KUProvostCarl and I will be watching @POTUS deliver the State of the Union Address! #SOTU2019 #RockChalk https://t.co/dsgc7nfgCk It was great getting to sit down with student leaders and staff from Haskell University today. I look forward to working together! https://t.co/keUs7Vk4ZE Thank you to Bill and Allan from the Kansas Rural Water Association for updating me on their improvements to our state‚Äôs clean water programs and upcoming apprenticeship opportunities.

Congratulations on leading the way.  #WeAreHolton https://t.co/SSCotPPPcl With next week being Future Business Leaders of America week, I decided to jump the gun and meet with some of the Kansas Future Business Leaders this afternoon. Thanks, Ben, Samantha, and Megan for meeting with me. The future is bright for these three! https://t.co/ghTThOnYTD It is time to be calculated, precise, and absolutely merciless when combatting international terrorism.

https://t.co/r1sqYqS5dA Combatting international terrorism is an ever-evolving dynamic that requires first-hand experience in tactical warfare. It is not enough to simply battle the threats of today; we must be preparing for the threats of tomorrow. A great event with an even greater cause. All proceeds go to the Kansas Special Olympics and keeping the over 4,000 Kansas athletes with intellectual disabilities on the playing field. https://t.co/iav3Qm4Wve Yesterday I participated in the 15th Annual Topeka #PolarPlunge put on by the @Topeka_Police, @ShawneeSheriff‚Äôs Office, Kansas Wildlife and Parks, and the Adjunct General‚Äôs office. Congrats #MVPat. Big things on the horizon KC! #chiefskingdom @PatrickMahomes5 Yesterday I toured the VA Eastern KS Healthcare System facilities in Topeka. They are doing some amazing work with the veterans crisis hotline, which is one of only three in the entire country. I look forward to partnering with them on the Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs. https://t.co/K5BMcxT3Hy Education is the primary avenue for Kansans to achieve the American dream. 

https://t.co/6N1hgvIU4K Still get chills. Two American heroes. 

https://t.co/7a2c9ABdbj Absolutely disgusting. This is why the pro-life movement matters and is as important as ever. https://t.co/dyzd5p28w7 Great chatting with the county and district attorneys of Kansas today. Thanks for coming by! https://t.co/mzsb03xAPV Topeka native, KU alum, and Folds of Honor champion, Gary Woodland. Awesome stuff! https://t.co/W8Hs8AfMK7 Had my first House Ed &amp; Labor and Foreign Affairs Committee meetings today. Looking forward to getting to work! https://t.co/FH5iLZr3Ox Always enjoy getting to chat with the @KS_Bankers Association. Thanks for coming by my office today! https://t.co/pKhRvFSTzD Thanks to the local School Board members from Topeka, Basehor, and Lawrence for coming by to talk education policy today! https://t.co/LTjbjtjOtM Great to have so many biofuel experts from the Fuels America Coalition in my office to chat about energy and agriculture. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/CQNEJi7dOk Yesterday I spoke on the House Floor honoring Kansas and Kansas Day.

Check it out below! 

https://t.co/jqizPcM7HL I was honored to be invited to speak at the Bleeding Kansas event in Lecompton yesterday. 

Great program and great history. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/jgBDIM3iEv I‚Äôve been to the death camps in Auschwitz &amp; Yad Vashem in Israel. These powerful and tragic sites remind us of our commitment to fight anti-semitism and like-minded evil. 

#WeRemember On this Holocaust Remembrance Day we honor the millions of lives lost and the heroes who helped put an end to the evil. I had a great time speaking at the Kansas Day Club dinner last night. 158 years looks good on you Kansas! https://t.co/9QQLG1OaRk Had a great time at the Topeka West JROTC 17th Annual Chili Feed yesterday! Good chili and even better company. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/HchQHs7vXV Always enjoy getting to chat with the @ShawneeCoGOP. Keep up the great work! https://t.co/ktZLpNsc6B Such an honor talking again with @SenPatRoberts. An outstanding mentor. Full of wisdom, advice, and jabs at my Army service. Thanks again Pat. https://t.co/hyJQySI1vG Another good faith offer from the President. The American people have suffered enough. We have three weeks, put the people before your partisanship Madam Speaker. Let‚Äôs reopen the government and secure our southern border. The US is the global leader and how we are situated in the global landscape is critically important not just for our country, but for liberty and prosperity everywhere. When America leads, the world is a better place. 

https://t.co/okFKUxAzn8 Was troubled by the disappearance of 14-year-old Chloe. Great work by Topeka‚Äôs finest in finding her. @Topeka_Police 

https://t.co/NT2vt0eiG3 #MLKDAY https://t.co/xZVMefH0dw As I stated to @41actionnews yesterday, the Democrats need to come to the table for good faith negotiations. What @POTUS outlined tonight is a common-sense path forward. @SpeakerPelosi needs to come to the table and end this shutdown. https://t.co/FP8gh2tztd Today is an important time for us all to be a voice for the voiceless. 

#life #prolife https://t.co/p4EUaZXO70 Although they were all barely able to fit in my office - it was great getting to talk with the Kansas Chiropractic Association today. I look forward to working together! https://t.co/eLQMRQvsWN Great getting to chat with the Kansas Hospital Association today. We talked about rural healthcare and what can be done to keep patients and doctors in control of their healthcare. https://t.co/YYEyMqNhFp Great to have John Rathbun and the Cutler Repaving folks stop by my office today to discuss pavement preservation. Always enjoy talking with fellow engineers! https://t.co/0JPBmUDpi7 Today I had the pleasure of meeting with Mike Oxford and Ami Weidler-Hyten with the Topeka Independent Living Resource Center. They shared their thoughts on how we can help further independent living in our communities. Thanks for coming by! https://t.co/ywWqlmxhQ5 The Military Birth Resource Network is doing great work providing a network of support for military families. Thanks to their Vice President Linda Herrick, of Ottawa, for stopping by my office today. Keep up the great work! https://t.co/IJNj8px4tQ It is time for our politics to represent the best of us, not appeal to the worst of us. For these reasons and many more, I am proud to vote in favor of this resolution. Members of this body should be held to a higher standard. If we ‚Äì as members of this great institution ‚Äì cannot hold ourselves to these standards, how can we expect our nation to? Today, the House voted on H.Res. 41, a resolution rejecting white nationalism and white supremacy. This type of rhetoric, this line of thinking, has no business being in these halls and the House should disapprove as a response. Always a pleasure getting to sit down with @JackRCline! I look forward to working together on behalf of @KUnews. Rock Chalk! 

#RockChalk #ks02 https://t.co/x8hYg54fOL My staff and I are fully devoted to delivering world-class constituent services. 

This seat belongs to the people of Kansas‚Äô second congressional district. Everything I do will be to serve their best interests. I have recently accepted the invitation to join the Problem Solvers Caucus, where I look forward to working on common-sense legislation that benefits all Kansans. My very first vote was against Nancy Pelosi to serve as Speaker of the House. I co-sponsored the no work no pay act, as well as the defund planned parenthood act. It‚Äôs always a pleasure getting to address the second district gop. I can‚Äôt thank all of these people enough for the support they‚Äôve shown me over the past year. It‚Äôs truly an honor to represent these folks. So let‚Äôs talk about what we‚Äôve done so far.. https://t.co/WFsoJqkBGY Here at the State Capitol for the @KansasGOP second district re-org. Always a pleasure seeing National Committee Woman Helen Van Etten! https://t.co/7Xw6Btzmcn Today is human trafficking awareness day ‚Äì a day we should all ask ourselves if there is more we can do to combat these truly atrocious human rights offenses.

As a Member of Congress, I will support initiatives that can help bring awareness of and an end to human trafficking. 4/4 We must continue to advance U.S. policy that eliminates anti-Semitism throughout all corners of the globe. 3/4 The appointed Envoy must also have extensive distinction in the field of religious freedom or combating anti-Semitism and must focus solely on monitoring and combating hatred toward Jews. 2/4 This timely legislation enhances the role of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. It elevates the Envoy to the rank of Ambassador who will report directly to the Secretary of State. 1/4 Anti-Semitism and like-minded hatred do not belong in our society, nor does it belong anywhere around the world. Today I was proud to vote in favor of H.R.221, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act. It was great sitting down with you @RepDavids I look forward to finding ways we can work together for Kansas. https://t.co/sZ64zKTuCY Wonderful news for Kansas today with the KC-46A Tanker ‚ÄùPegasus‚Äù coming to Mcconnel Air Force Base! Great work by both @JerryMoran and @SenPatRoberts! @22ARW Kansans sent me to Washington to deliver results. I look forward to working with members of both parties in the Problems Solvers Caucus to deliver common-sense legislation that benefits everyday Kansans.

https://t.co/fnEpMQwlFU I know what it is like going to work each day knowing it could be the last. Make sure to thank a law enforcement officer today. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay Today I had the honor of leading House proceedings in the Pledge of Allegiance 

Check it out here üëâ https://t.co/hJlTn9KwRa Today I delivered my maiden speech on the House floor reaffirming my commitment to Kansas - you can check it out here.
https://t.co/3rqg9W3dnk He has dedicated his life to his state and to his country. It has been an honor to have such a man heading the delegation for so long. His guidance, gravitas, and wisdom will be missed on Capitol Hill. #ksleg #KS02 https://t.co/PJr6nc5n4g Senator, Representative, Kansan, Father, Husband, Marine, and above all ‚Äì patriot. @PatRoberts is the standard bearer for what it means to be a public official. What Pat Roberts has done for agriculture and the state of Kansas should be appreciated by all. If you don't get paid - I dont https://t.co/79ZUFvWkDb
