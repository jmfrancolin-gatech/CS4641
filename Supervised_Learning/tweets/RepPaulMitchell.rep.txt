You can watch live by clicking the link below. https://t.co/hpphrhOe1q I hope all my friends who celebrate have a joyous and meaningful #Hanukkah! https://t.co/kHNgEZ1u93 Saddened to hear of the passing of former President George HW Bush. A WWII hero, he committed his life to service - serving as director of the CIA, Vice President, and as 41st President. His contributions to the nation were great, and our prayers are with his family and friends. We then traveled to Kuwait, where we received an update on operations in the Middle East before sharing a pre-Thanksgiving meal w/troops stationed @ Camp #Arifan‚Äã. I‚Äôm so grateful for the men &amp; women who serve our nation and want to make sure they know we support them. üá∫üá∏ (3/3) https://t.co/Km7Bx66s5h First, we went to Ramstein Air Base, Germany‚Äã, where we visited wounded servicemembers and met with doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center‚Äã, as well as participated in a National Day of Mourning ceremony to recognize all victims of war and persecution.

(5/5) Auditors said the Army, Navy, and Air Force could account for the existence and completeness of major military equipment.
‚Ä¢ However, auditors found many material weaknesses including Property, Plant, and Equipment; Inventory; IT Systems Security; and Financial Reporting. 
(4/5) I wanted to share some of the results of the audit with you:

‚Ä¢ Auditors did not report any material weaknesses for civilian or military pay.
‚Ä¢ Auditors said they found no evidence of fraud.
(3/5) I believe an audit is a good thing - especially for a department as large as the DoD - because it allows us to identify ways to better manage our national defense resources, as well as finds issues Congress and the Pentagon can work together to address. (2/5) Recently, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released the results of its first ever department-wide audit, which was conducted by approximately 1,200 auditors making more than 900 site visits to military bases, depots, warehouses, and more.
