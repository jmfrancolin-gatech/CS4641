Earlier this year, we took a major step in combating this affliction. This new law advances both research and treatments for pediatric cancer to give hope to the youngest patients battling this disease. #IL12 #twill https://t.co/NKOP0E5zyw "Middle-class income rose to the highest recorded levels in 2017 and the national poverty rate declined as the benefits of the strong economy lifted the fortunes of more Americans."

https://t.co/36yExvliUn Since day one in Congress I've been clear that we must protect individuals w/ pre-existing conditions.  If you have a pre-existing condition you deserve peace of mind in knowing you won‚Äôt be dropped from coverage when you need it the most. #IL12 #twill

https://t.co/cc7KdEAu1k Good News! Small biz optimism surged to its highest level ever, riding a wave from #TaxReform &amp; deregulation. The Small Business Optimism Index reading climbed to a record high at 108.8. The previous record was 108, set back in 1983 during the Reagan administration. #BetterOffNow https://t.co/HMcUlFuKWp "As the tax and regulatory landscape changed, so did small business expectations and plans." üìà#BetterOffNow #TaxReform https://t.co/JV3f6G5atA Let us never forget the heroes who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.
