‚Ä¢ Reinstate the assault weapons ban
‚Ä¢ Ban high capacity magazines
‚Ä¢ Close loopholes in the background check system

However, he refuses to act. #SOTU2EndGunViolence #SOTU "Great nations do not fight endless wars."

Let's get out of Yemen. Congress must reassert its constitutional duty on matters of war and peace and get the U.S. out of this senseless conflict. #SOTU Let's set the President's record on Israel straight: POTUS made a provocative decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy, which emboldened Israeli reactions to demonstrators and caused some of the highest levels of violence experienced in the area #SOTU You know how you don't solve the #HIV crisis?

These Americans and their families deserve better. #SOTU https://t.co/S2kBDNH8qY The President just said it himself: the next major priority must be lowering the cost of health care and prescription drugs, and to protect those with pre-existing conditions.

Let's hold him to it and ensure that attacks on the Affordable Care Act end. #SOTU Wait, is this #InfrastructureWeek? #HeardThisBefore #SOTU On trade agreements, we must hold the Trump Administration accountable to their promise of standing up for working families and making real changes to our failed trade policies. Empty rhetoric won't cut it. #SOTU Every word President Trump says about the wall is a wasted breath.

Mr. President, you're not getting your damn wall. Period. #SOTU Hey @realDonaldTrump, thanks for bringing up ICE officers.

Last week, I went to @ICEgov's offices in Washington to demand answers regarding raids in Wisconsin last September.

The agency still hasn't responded to my months' old FOIA request. This is unacceptable. #SOTU POTUS denigrating immigrants and spewing these lies during a State of the Union address is a disgusting new low. #SOTU No Member of Congress is pushing for open borders.

That is a fact. #SOTU Can @realDonaldTrump please tell us how he's going to build the wall in the next week before his alleged caravan shows up at the border?

His fear-mongering is absolutely shameful. #SOTU FACT: American is committed to locking up children, separating families, and enacting a cruel, inhumane, and un-American immigration policy. #SOTU RT to make sure @realDonaldTrump gets the message: The Mueller investigation is not a ridiculous partisan investigation

That's if we still even have a planet thanks to this Administration. #SOTU "We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty."

Aka, we tried to throw millions of Americans off their health care and cut protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. #SOTU "More people are working now than at any time in our history."

Yes, that's because more people are living in our country than at any time in our history. #SOTU An unprecedented economic boom?

The President is living in his own la-la land and it‚Äôs time for @senatemajldr to stand up to him. https://t.co/IvfY84rIDD RT @jljacobson: I am at the border and almost everything that @realDonaldTrump is saying this moment on TV is a lie. Absolutely shameful. This is an outrageous assault on the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are going without pay.

In the meantime, @RepMcGovern and House Leadership have committed to us that #PAYGO will not be an impediment to advancing key progressive priorities in the 116th Congress. .@RepJayapal and I have been concerned about #PAYGO for months, and have had numerous conversations with Rules Chairman @RepMcGovern and House leadership about these concerns. We all agree that the real problem with #PAYGO exists in the statute that requires it. This New Year, hardworking men and women across the country will see a much needed pay raise. 

This is a step in the right direction, but we need to pay all workers a living wage.
