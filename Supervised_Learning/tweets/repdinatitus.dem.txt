Looking forward to working with Chairman @RepRaulGrijalva to get this done next year. https://t.co/zQScWKzL8U As Professor Emeritus of #UNLV and their representative in Congress, I am proud of the faculty, staff, and students who helped make this milestone possible. https://t.co/lbcmCR7neo Senate Appropriations has filed a Continuing Resolution to keep the government 100% funded through Feb. 8 of next year. Happy to report the #CR does not waste any more money on #YuccaMountain.  https://t.co/6MRQaSi5mJ We knew this was coming. Still not sure why the Admin. didn't work with us on #bumpstockban to avoid this mess. https://t.co/N0kgItW5GX Thank you to my friends @OppVillageLV for the beautiful holiday sweater. https://t.co/IMag9hAeg1 Proud of Nevada for leading the way! #HERstory https://t.co/GaayNmXCx3 See my full statement on today's #bumpstock rule here: https://t.co/IxkKVvRSmX (3/3) Congress needs to act. That is why I introduced the bipartisan Closing the #BumpStock Loophole Act along with Reps. Fitzpatrick, Kildee, and Trott. I'm working w/ my colleagues to remove any question about authority and get these devices off the market. (2/3) The Admin. has released its final rule to ban #bumpstocks. Since it was first announced I raised concerns this would be tied up in the courts as ATF has repeatedly said it doesn't have this authority. (1/3) Happy to announce the @RTCSNV was awarded a $300k competitive grant to help develop transit along an 8.7 mi stretch of Maryland Parkway through the heart of the Las Vegas valley. This is a critical project to enhance the connectivity from the airport to downtown. https://t.co/qczqVLW3ya Major questions about @DeptVetAffairs‚Äô continued use of dogs in painful experiments. Taxpayers deserve more transparency &amp; accountability from their govt. Read about my latest, bipartisan effort to shine light on VA #dogtesting:
https://t.co/lad6qYX9TC TY @SteveSisolak, @AaronDFordNV. Good to have partners at the state level standing with us in this fight to defend the #ACA and protect access to health care for hundreds of thousands of Nevadans. https://t.co/MHi52NmVUL RT @Covers_Vegas: I‚Äôve written on this tax in my past life, in editorials for @reviewjournal, and in current life for @Covers. I think tax‚Ä¶ Thank u, next. https://t.co/Y7QfqzZLwZ Congratulations to all of our #NV01  @CongressionalAC participants and winners. It is so impressive to see your innovative #apps at work! #STEM https://t.co/LMrkIg4W8i This 7 year old girl‚Äôs death is another tragic consequence of the Trump Administration's disastrous immigration policy. We cannot stand idly by while children die or are ripped from their parents‚Äô arms at our southern border. https://t.co/V8VTEj2amN At 9:35 EST, 6 years ago, a shooter broke into #SandyHook Elementary School killing 20 children ages 6 and 7. This week I took to the Floor of the House of Reps. to call on my colleagues to join me in fighting for real action to prevent #GunViolence. https://t.co/NaL9hm8N5S @_Christyna_ @stephenpeters2 @HRC @david_stacy Are you familiar with the #EqualityAct? This legislation supported by nearly every single member of the Democratic Caucus does just that. Our advocacy does not have to be either or. We can and must fight here at home and abroad. #GLOBEAct I have a long record fighting for a cleaner future and come January, my colleagues and I will be advancing an agenda that invests in clean energy, protects our bedrock enviro laws, conserves our #publiclands, and defends against the Trump attacks on science. #ActOnClimate #ClimateChange is not an issue we can ignore. I joined 97 of my colleagues calling on the President to #ActOnClimate and respond to the findings of the #NationalClimateAssessment. https://t.co/etayoA6lQT RT @chrisjohnson82: New GLOBE Act introduced by @repdinatitus asserts U.S. opposition to anti-LGBT abuses overseas https://t.co/HxEF3vvfD8‚Ä¶ As a member of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, I‚Äôm working towards equal treatment of the marijuana industry. Hear more from my interview on #NVNewsMakers https://t.co/N320bZ1zcn Pleasure to sit down with Sam Shad from #NVNewsMakers to discuss our expanded Democratic majority. https://t.co/fzs8nRlrbs @IEquality Thank you for support and advocacy! #GLOBEAct @ajws @UN Thank you for your support and advocacy! #GLOBEAct @interACT_adv @HRC @PPFA @amnestyusa @Global_Equality @ajws @humanrights1st @amprog @glaad @IEquality Thank you for your support and advocacy! #GLOBEAct @Global_Equality @dinatitus @wordpressdotcom Thank you for your support and advocacy! #GLOBEAct @PPact Thank you for your support and advocacy! #GLOBEAct I urge my Republican colleagues in the Senate to stop obstructing H.R. 299, bipartisan legislation to ensure our #BlueWaterNavy veterans can get the benefits they deserve. Justice for these Vietnam vets is long overdue. #AgentOrange @lifeandstuff247 It was included in the Rule for the bill, which I opposed.
