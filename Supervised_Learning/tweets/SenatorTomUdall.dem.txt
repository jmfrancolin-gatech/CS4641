Some places are just too special to lose. BLM did the right thing delaying lease sales near sacred &amp; fragile land at #Chaco.
 
But now, the admin. should take the next step and stop leasing in this area, so that Tribal &amp; public concerns can be fully heard. https://t.co/9pYJ1pkYQK Sustaining our national parks &amp; public lands is an issue most Americans can get behind— that's why we need to stand up against the Trump administration's baseless attacks on our outdoor spaces and protect #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/3cYup0jrDG I had the chance to meet with some bright students and the dedicated presidents of New Mexico’s Tribal Colleges and Universities for #tribalcollegeweek here on the Hill. I’m proud to fight for TCU resources and support the important work they do. https://t.co/LwmdfkShuN John Dingell was a giant of the Congress, and he brought uncommon compassion, dedication, and good humor to his decades of public service. Jill and I are thinking of @RepDebDingell at this sad time. National monuments &amp; protected public lands:

-Fuel an $887 billion outdoor recreation economy
-Sustain 7.6 million jobs across the country
-Create billions in tax revenue
-Get millions of visitors each year
-Play a key role in our national &amp; community identities
#MonumentsForAll https://t.co/pzV4Cy8qQe New Mexico's great outdoors are key to our identity, heritage, &amp; economy—after all, it’s why they call us the Land of Enchantment. I'm proud to lead the ANTIQUITIES Act with @RepDebHaaland to stand up for our public lands, and the communities that cherish them. #MonumentsForAll Public lands belong in public hands— not in the hands of the highest bidder. RT if you agree. https://t.co/xxB2ucdK86 Today, I’m leading over 100 members of Congress in introducing the ANTIQUITIES Act of 2019.
 
The Trump administration’s attacks on our national monuments are illegal. We need to protect our cherished public lands and our nation's bipartisan conservation legacy. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/hRJmHwgw5N One thing @POTUS made clear last night in his #SOTU:
 
His administration will keep ignoring what the people actually want in order to give big money donors &amp; lobbyists a leg up.

We must pass #ForThePeople legislation to fix our democracy and return it to the American people. WATCH LIVE: I’m on the Senate floor talking about how important it is that we protect our nation’s treasured outdoor spaces, and about major conservation victories we secured for New Mexico in the Senate’s public lands package: https://t.co/ASBfsMUiD7 We continue to uncover disturbing revelations about the Trump admin's family separation policy. 

I stand with New Mexicans in condemning this policy, carried out with sheer cruelty and incompetence. I'm co-sponsoring the Keep Families Together Act to stop this inhumane practice. The president’s appeals to unity rang hollow, because he insists on sowing hatred, fear, and division – with rhetoric demonizing immigrants and spreading misinformation about our border. After dragging us through the longest shutdown in American history, @POTUS seems committed to the same destructive tactics that caused 35 days of pain and fear for families across New Mexico and the country. #SOTU On my way to the #SOTU with Navajo Nation President Nez. He comes to Washington with so many stories of how the #TrumpShutdown disrupted critical health &amp; safety services in Native communities— stories we must keep in mind as we consider the current state of our union. https://t.co/sbiajuANep .@EPA must take the threat of PFOS &amp; PFAS seriously. @MartinHeinrich &amp; I wrote @EPAAWheeler to say as much, but reading about their pick to handle this issue is deeply disconcerting. EPA leadership should serve the people, not billionaires &amp; corporations. https://t.co/OgJQLbOmwB The Trump admin. is refusing to reunite families they’ve ripped apart, calling it a “burden."
 
In tonight's #SOTU, is @POTUS going to take responsibility for the burden of lasting pain &amp; trauma his admin. has inflicted on these children &amp; their parents? https://t.co/p95b4Ntcxm Proud that the President of the Navajo Nation, @NNPrezNez, will be my guest at the #SOTU tonight, sending a message to the Trump administration about the importance of our responsibilities to Tribal communities in New Mexico and across the country. We do not need another Interior Secretary with a polluters over people agenda—who opens the door to corporate lobbyists &amp; donors while shutting out Native voices, the scientific community, &amp; the public.
 
My full statement on David Bernhardt's nomination: https://t.co/TG9XhnUhVJ The #TrumpShutdown had devastating ripple effects throughout Native communities, and it's going to take a long time to get up &amp; running again. I've introduced legislation to make sure this breakdown in our trust &amp; treaty obligations never happens again. https://t.co/fLqE7Z9zAn RT @thedailybeast: Sen. Tom Udall: Congress must “assert its role as a co-equal branch of government” and block Trump from raiding these ac… .@WalterRubel is an exemplary journalist and trusted voice for Las Cruces. This is a sad day for @CrucesSunNews. More than ever, we need thriving local journalism to keep our communities informed &amp; democracy strong. https://t.co/RH9OtTODDg We're introducing the RAIDER Act to stop the president from using a national emergency declaration to raid disaster relief funds for his border wall.
Congress is a co-equal branch of gov't. We can't let @POTUS go around us to build his wasteful wall. https://t.co/w9RCVyn77v During #BlackHistoryMonth, we celebrate the countless ways black Americans strengthen our nation. We honor black Americans’ enduring struggle for justice, and acknowledge how our nation still fails to live up to our ideals. We continue the march toward equality &amp; justice for all. Our bills take much-needed action against the admin's out-of touch attacks: they would restore basic due process to eminent domain, protect sensitive wildlife areas from border barrier construction and subject Trump’s wall to the same laws that govern other federal projects. As a border state senator, I can tell you: most New Mexicans don’t want the president’s wall, because it could cause irreparable damage to our border &amp; environment. @MartinHeinrich &amp; I are standing up for our state with bills to protect NM's landowners, wildlife &amp; way of life. We've introduced major, bipartisan legislation to close gaps in current laws that have left Native children, sexual assault survivors, and Tribal police unprotected.
 
Congress must pass these bills and provide Tribal governments with the tools they need to ensure public safety. https://t.co/59PxBX80WE Proud to lead the full New Mexico delegation and re-introduce the #EstherMartinez Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act. This legislation honors Esther Martinez’s legacy and promotes Tribes’ work to maintain and revitalize Native languages. Even during the gov't shutdown, the Trump Admin. moved forward with leasing for development near Chaco Canyon, without transparency. 
 
#Chaco is a UNESCO world heritage site sacred to Tribes. Leases within 10 miles of Chaco should be halted to listen to public &amp; Native voices. https://t.co/C2Q3MrOp32 Hispanic women in New Mexico make 53 cents on the dollar, Native women 57, and black women 64. This inequity can’t stand, and I won’t stop fighting until everyone gets #EqualPay for equal work. It's the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act— an important step, but we still have a lot of work to do. After all, in New Mexico, women make 84 cents for every $1 a man makes &amp; the numbers are even lower for women of color. #Ledbetter10 Great to see @GovMLG standing up for a cleaner future— and for New Mexicans’ way of life. Climate change is already hurting NM, and if the federal gov’t isn’t going to take action, states, communities, and businesses need to step up. https://t.co/87zqODzb80 Glad we got @EPA to change course &amp; keep safeguards in place to protect farmworkers—including children—from pesticides. There's NO reason to weaken such rules. That’s why I fought for a bipartisan pesticide bill to protect them. Congress should pass it. https://t.co/lsF31E5ipt #HR1 makes sure billionaires can’t buy our elections anymore. If that worries @senatemajldr, maybe the bill isn’t the problem. https://t.co/WrkVpXR3ew In the first @IndianCommittee hearing of the 116th Congress we got right to work, approving several bills, including the PROGRESS Act &amp; SURVIVE Act. These will improve self-governance &amp; public safety— two of Indian Country’s long term legislative priorities. https://t.co/Z4iK2Y8SeJ Proud to reintroduce #SavannasAct this Congress. This bipartisan legislation seeks justice for Native women who go missing &amp; experience violence at alarming rates— crimes that often go uninvestigated.

We must pass this bill as a first step towards ending the violence. #MMIW The #TrumpShutdown cost our country $11 billion— yes, billion. And $3 billion of that is gone forever. That's on top of the pain he caused so many hardworking families, which can't be counted in dollars. We can't allow @POTUS to do this ever again. https://t.co/qUOjUSxYP6 While communities across the U.S. rush to prep for a dangerous cold front, POTUS makes jokes about this potential disaster online.

We know climate change contributes to extreme weather events. But sadly, the facts just don't matter to this president. https://t.co/WKqrtSnbja It’s a historic day as @HouseJudiciary begins hearings on #HR1, a bill that will end corruption and put the power of our democracy right back where it belongs: in the hands of the people.

I’m leading this legislation in the Senate, because the system is broken. We must act. https://t.co/Asr6WkfDNY Jill and I are sending our thoughts and condolences to the whole Saavedra family today— Rep. Saavedra was a dedicated leader who loved New Mexico and was a tireless advocate for the S. Valley. His legacy of unity and kindness won’t soon be forgotten. https://t.co/YAsXavJUFR Now that the shutdown is over, we need to make sure federal employees in #NM and across the country get their missed paychecks without delay. 
 
We wrote #OPM’s @Weichert45 to stand up for these workers. They need to know when they're getting paid. And they need to be paid ASAP. https://t.co/oSviLDDF0T The #TrumpShutdown showed us why so many Americans believe their government doesn't answer to them. The voices of the people are being shut out.

I'm leading a bold reform bill to root out corruption, fix our system, and give power back to the people. https://t.co/dcMVerhiQC Interrupting #SouthwestChief service would hurt local economies all along the route, and our communities can't afford that. @amtrak needs to work with communities from New Mexico to Kansas to make sure this engine of economic growth stays on track. https://t.co/S8T0YQLoZA On Holocaust Remembrance Day, #WeRemember the millions of Jews &amp; other victims who were murdered, and we honor the survivors of such evil. Let us renew our vow to never stay silent in the face of hate, to fight antisemitism &amp; to care for the most vulnerable among us. #NeverAgain Now that there is a path to re-opening the government, the president must face up to reality, drop his outrageous and wasteful wall demands, and support common-sense border security proposals so we can keep the government open long-term. It shouldn’t have taken 35 days and a month of missed paychecks to end the #TrumpShutdown. In fact, this attempt at governance-by-extortion never should have happened.

Now, we need to ensure every person hurt by the shutdown— in NM and across the country— is made whole. RT @KFOX14: #NewMexico @SenatorTomUdall and @TeamHeinrich are fighting to ensure that federal workers don’t lose their vision and dental in… Numbers don’t lie: people would rather have an open government than a wall. So why is the #TrumpShutdown still going on?
 
@senatemajldr, do right by the American people. Work with us and open up the government. https://t.co/hEhG2KZKQ8 Native communities didn’t ask for a #TrumpShutdown. But, as is often the case, they're among those hurt most. We must open the gov't now &amp; restore essential services, not only because it’s the right thing to do— failing to goes against the core of our trust &amp; treaty obligations. With @IHSgov &amp; @USIndianAffairs shut down, Native communities are losing essential health &amp; safety services. I'm introducing legislation to ensure Tribes are protected in future shutdowns— because even when this ends, who knows if @POTUS will force another? On my way to the Senate floor where I'll vote to end the #TrumpShutdown, with no conditions attached.
 
Let's re-open the government, stop holding innocent people hostage, and then work to resolve our differences on border security &amp; immigration. It's as simple as that. The #TrumpShutdown is taking public safety hostage, too.

As @afa_cwa says: "we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire [air travel] system will break.”

@SenateGOP: we need to end the shutdown right away. Work with us. https://t.co/3lTdQ2OU3q This week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss their 2nd paycheck of the #TrumpShutdown, a crisis for most families.
 
But ultra-wealthy members of the Trump administration are blind to the real, tragic impact this shutdown has on hardworking Americans. https://t.co/x8ywyYcppo The Polluter Pays principle is fundamental to environmental law. This lack of enforcement is alarming.

And now @EPA is shut down, but the polluters aren’t. @EPAAWheeler must answer for what this means for our air and water, and ultimately, our future. Time after time, the Trump @EPA puts polluters’ wallets over clean air and water for the American people.
 
By failing to penalize polluters, they've once again shown a complete disregard both for their mission and for public health. https://t.co/IUopEuqJwU Honored to speak to the #NMLeg yesterday. As I said in my address, we are one state. We all have a stake in the prosperity of our communities. We all have a stake in the success of our children’s future. When we work together, we are capable of accomplishing so much more for NM. https://t.co/ijlKrZ2NKQ This shutdown never should have happened in the first place—and it certainly shouldn't still be going on. The American people are hurting, and they can't afford to wait as @POTUS and @senatemajldr continue to stand in the way of a resolution.

It's time to re-open the government. -Day 28: Senator Lankford objects to ending the shutdown— on Senator McConnell's behalf.
-Day 32: Senator McConnell objects to ending the shutdown.
-Day 33: Senator McConnell objects to ending the shutdown. -Day 22: #TrumpShutdown becomes the longest in history.
-Day 25:  Senator McConnell objects to ending the shutdown. Twice.
-Day 27:  Senator McConnell objects to ending the shutdown. -Day 13: @HouseDemocrats pass spending bills to open the government.
-Day 19: @POTUS walks out of meeting with congressional leadership.
-Day 20: Senator McConnell objects to ending the shutdown. Twice. -2 Days Before Shutdown: Senate UNANIMOUSLY passes spending bill @POTUS agreed to.
-1 Day Before Shutdown: @POTUS changes his mind, decides to shut down the gov't, taking innocent people's livelihoods hostage.
-Days 1-12: House &amp; Senate GOP refuse to vote to re-open government. We're in the the longest government shutdown in American history. Families across New Mexico and the country are suffering. 
 
But we didn't get here by accident. At every step of the way, @POTUS and @senatemajldr have blocked sensible efforts to re-open the gov't. 
 
A timeline: This cruel #TrumpShutdown never should have happened and needs to end. Senate Republicans should join with @SenateDems to pass a clean bill to re-open the government immediately. The details of @POTUS' proposal show that it is even worse than it first looked.

Not only does it waste billions in taxpayer money on an ineffective wall, but it also includes poison pill, anti-immigrant changes to current law--while not providing meaningful relief for Dreamers. https://t.co/EN6AfZpcew So @SenateMajLdr, please—let’s end the shutdown that never should have happened, and then we can work in good faith on smart border security. This is untenable &amp; it’s actively hurting hardworking Americans.
It’s just wrong. End the #TrumpShutdown We need to take a step back from the politics and look at the real, human impact of this shutdown. Yesterday I talked to some of the many New Mexicans who are hurting right now and let me tell you: this senseless shutdown needs to end immediately. https://t.co/DO1CR9k4II We must do all that we can – as representatives of the people – to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. To carefully tend to this garden. And to fulfill the bold promise our state and our country hold. #UdallNMLeg We are one state. We all have a stake in our communities' prosperity. We all have a stake in our children’s future.  When we work together, we accomplish so much more than when we isolate ourselves within the walls of our own party. #UdallNMLeg I hear from thousands of New Mexicans as I travel around the state. And they all want the same things – a livable wage. Accessible health care. A stronger state &amp; brighter future for our children.
 
Even when we disagree, we are all committed to these same goals. #UdallNMLeg New Mexico’s four military bases all serve critical national security missions. And we have made sure those missions continue — I am committed to the expansion and success of our bases. #UdallNMLeg Our national laboratories &amp; military bases keep our nation secure. They're a cornerstone of our economy &amp; workforce. Los Alamos &amp; Sandia are at record funding levels. And we want to make sure clean up at LANL goes forward. #UdallNMLeg New Mexicans want and deserve quality health care, but not enough have it. Just as we have worked to defend the #ACA, we need to fight challenges in our health system.
 
And we must fight the opioid epidemic ravaging NM. We need to end the scourge of opioid addiction. #UdallNMLeg As we work to vitalize our rural economy, we must think big. I am committed to closing the digital divide in rural NM &amp; across the nation. That’s why I have worked on grants and legislation to secure rural and tribal broadband. #UdallNMLeg Acequias and land grants are so important to New Mexico. But they face red tape trying to access @USDA programs. We passed legislation to makes them directly eligible for assistance and funding. And we re-started the flow of funds to the Army Corps acequia program. #UdallNMLeg As a senior member on @SenateApprops, I have a chance fight for funding that benefits our state.
 
One of my priorities is our rural economy. I've worked on legislation to increase resources for farmers &amp; ranchers who are just getting started or looking to expand. #UdallNMLeg In all I try &amp; accomplish for Indian Country, three principles guide me: respect for tribes’ &amp; pueblos’ sovereignty, promotion of self-determination &amp; federal government's obligation to engage in meaningful consultation whenever federal actions affect Indian Country. #UdallNMLeg I have the privilege of serving as vice-chair of @IndianCommittee. Our state is proud to be home to one of the largest percentage of Native Americans in the nation. New Mexico has one of the richest diversity of cultures in the nation. #UdallNMLeg The scientific consensus is clear. @IPCC_CH warns we have only 12 years to meet this challenge head on or we can’t reverse course.

And on that note: we must protect public lands. They're essential to our identity and economy— public lands belong in public hands. #UdallNMLeg NM feels climate change, and we need to fight drought and modernize water infrastructure. We can't meet 21st century challenges with 19th century infrastructure— so I've worked to nearly double the funding to rural water projects. #UdallNMLeg I support immigration reform. Dreamers &amp; their families should be able to stay in our state &amp; communities. Families must be reunited. Inhumane immigration policies must end. New Mexico is a border state. I am making sure we are all heard in these debates. #UdallNMLeg When the gov’t is open, we can debate &amp; negotiate in good faith. I support strong border security. But I want to see cost-effective &amp; locally appropriate measures. Not the president’s wall that won’t work, costs billions &amp; would stand as a symbol of division. #UdallNMLeg The terrible gov’t shutdown impacts more than 10,000 NM federal employees,  and many contractors in our state. This shutdown is affecting real people, with real mortgages, real bills to pay, and real families to feed.  
 
The cruelty of this shutdown must stop.  #UdallNMLeg I’ve been working for years on comprehensive reform for our democracy. My #ForThePeople Act will rein in our campaign finance system, end gerrymandering &amp; set a high ethical bar for gov't officials.

These measures are not red or blue.  They are red, white, and blue. #UdallNMLeg Democracy depends on all citizens voting.
Democracy depends on elected officials carrying out the people's will.
Democracy depends on gov't officials working for the people, not their wallets.

My #ForThePeople reform package will help return democracy to the people. #UdallNMLeg Polls shows the people want affordable healthcare, good jobs, gun safety laws, measures to combat climate change &amp; humane immigration laws.  Yet, many in Congress &amp; the Executive only seem to hear the 1%. It’s no wonder trust in Congress is so low. #UdallNMLeg Election season is over. It’s time to govern. New Mexicans are ready for action. Let’s deliver.

Our democracy needs rebuilding &amp; revitalizing. There is a deep disconnect at the nat'l level between what the people want &amp; what their elected officials are giving them. #UdallNMLeg I am honored to address the New Mexico State legislature today, at the start of a new year where bold action is imperative. Follow along using  #UdallNMLeg for updates. The speech is also streaming: https://t.co/F8k3ViYWzG Today in ABQ, I stood with New Mexicans of all backgrounds, including:

-federal employees
-Tribal leaders
-contractors
-business owners
-families

who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. Their stories are heartbreaking. This should never have happened, and it needs to end. https://t.co/xhtThGAmjB So thankful for the chance to address the 23rd MLK Community Commemorative Breakfast in ABQ today. A reminder that we can best honor Dr. King by continuing his work – to further equality, lift people out of poverty, and spread a message of peace. https://t.co/0i3lsmRlzQ Today, we must recommit to fighting injustice &amp; standing up for the values Dr. King worked for— the same values that define New Mexico. Love, understanding, and kindness are the keys to creating a better future for our state and our nation. https://t.co/96NJ4eV6St .@RepDebHaaland said it best. This video is heartbreaking. But on this MLK weekend, Mr. Phillips of the Omaha Nation reminds us all of Dr. King’s lasting legacy of promoting unity over division. Let’s strive to meet his example. #omahanation https://t.co/wag3qbZjaV Let’s put aside the broken politics and end the shutdown. After that we can have a good-faith discussion about border security without harming hundreds of thousands of innocent people. The president has said he's "proud” to shut down the government and hold Americans’ livelihoods hostage.

The American people are tired of this sheer dysfunction, and we shouldn't validate or accept it. It’s time to stop this governance-by-extortion. It's time do the right thing: end the #TrumpShutdown and stop jeopardizing the safety of the American people. If we're really concerned about keeping our country safe, re-opening the government should be our top priority. When we add it all up what do we learn? @SenateGOP &amp; @POTUS are putting the health of everyday people at risk to try and get billions in taxpayer $ for an ineffective wall.

That's not leadership. That's using innocent people as pawns for political purposes. But that's not all. @TSA is understaffed &amp; unpaid. And @DHSgov &amp; @CBP are shuttered as well— showing that whatever the #TrumpShutdown is about, it's not border security And Americans' health is on the line. @EPA suspended most inspections of power plants and even water treatment facilities. @FDA can't conduct its usual food inspections. New Mexico, with all our incredible outdoor spaces, feels the impacts of closing @Interior. @NatlParkService sites are unstaffed but open, putting visitor safety and these incredible lands the government has promised to protect at risk. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting more and more Americans every day. Because when federal workers are furloughed, the big and small things they do every day to ensure the health and safety of our nation fall by the wayside.

Here are a few examples of just how dangerous this is: The Ornelas family is one of so many in NM &amp; across the nation hurt by the shutdown.

But this morning, @SenateGOP objected yet again to a vote that could end it.

The Ornelas family can't afford to wait any longer. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Kr0vAeFcpH The latest allegations against President Trump are astonishing.
 
To get the full truth, we need to protect the Mueller investigation and Congress must continue its own with complete transparency. No one— not even the president of the United States— is above the law. On the Senate floor today, @senatemajldr refused to end the #TrumpShutdown. What’s it going to take for @SenateGOP to put the people over the President’s political demands? LIVE: I’m demanding @senatemajldr call a vote on our bipartisan Interior Appropriations bill that would reopen parts of the gov't— including @Interior &amp; @EPA.
 
Time for @SenateGOP to do the right thing &amp; end the shutdown. https://t.co/tq0rGECRMX Big Banks get assistance during the #TrumpShutdown but New Mexico farmers and ranchers don’t? It’s unacceptable to treat the NM farmers and ranchers who help feed our families and fuel our economy this way.
https://t.co/H9FoM3fPZm Agriculture is $3bn of New Mexico's economy &amp; part of our identity. But critical @USDA support for hardworking farmers &amp; ranchers is cut off during the #TrumpShutdown.
 
@senatemajldr, this can't go on. Let’s vote to get @USDA and all agencies up &amp; running. End the shutdown. https://t.co/MOxC3Eo1zf Horrifying: thousands more children were separated from their families at the border than the Trump admin first admitted.

No one— not @DHSgov, not @HHSgov— kept track of these helpless children. Incompetence &amp; inhumanity from @POTUS &amp; his administration. https://t.co/Sghdfg7HF0 Congratulations to @UNMHSC's Project ECHO! It's amazing to see a homegrown health effort go global. Your work has made a major difference in New Mexico, and you're going to make an even bigger impact around the world. https://t.co/dQWoqLyrQf Congress wrote #ICWA recognizing that Native children— like all children— thrive when they grow up with the support of their families, communities and cultures.

But a dangerous court ruling threatens this vital law. That's why I'm leading a bipartisan brief to protect #ICWA. https://t.co/889kbnpxtf Congratulations @Spaceport_NM— this is good news for New Mexico. Proud to keep working with you on expanding infrastructure and employment in our community to help our state's innovation economy continue to grow strong. https://t.co/kjAHaTRnGi .@EPAAWheeler claims to acknowledge the severity of climate change. Then why has the Trump @EPA— which he leads— done everything in its power to ignore this threat and sabotage our attempts to fight it? https://t.co/EBHy8q05A6 Today on the Capitol steps, I joined @senatedems to highlight the stories of some of the Americans devastated by the #TrumpShutdown.
 
@POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr, these are just a few of the people this shutdown is hurting. We can end it now. https://t.co/e9cB00cl9A Went to the Senate floor today to talk about the Ornelas family, one of the tens of thousands of families in New Mexico impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/0ogMSTNhRD WATCH LIVE: Joining fellow @SenateDems on the Capitol steps to highlight the devastating effects of the #TrumpShutdown on New Mexicans &amp; families across the nation. https://t.co/V6oGSuqe5U Their older son, Ian, is now the main provider for the family. Ian works at the Department of Interior, has been furloughed 26 days— and has now missed a paycheck.

The Ornelas family is scared to death Ian will miss another paycheck, and another.

The #TrumpShutdown must end. Zachary Ornelas had a brain tumor, and has undergone two surgeries. He now needs constant care.

His stepfather, Ervie, reduced his work by 75 percent to take care of Zachary.

His mother, Leah's, paycheck goes to medical bills.

His family moved back in together to save money. I'm on my way to the Senate floor to share the story of Zachary Ornelas and the Ornelas family, from Carlsbad, NM. They're one of thousands of families in New Mexico who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/Wfo1N4EzS8 .@GovMLG laid out an inspiring roadmap for New Mexico in her #StateOfTheStateNM address today. Priorities like funding early childhood, a clean environment and an open government will boost all New Mexicans. https://t.co/YUtDsadsOH Today on #TuesdaysWithTom, I discussed the devastating consequences of the #TrumpShutdown on NM. The president &amp; @SenateGOP are holding New Mexicans' livelihoods hostage for a ransom of $5 billion in taxpayer dollars— all for an offensive, wasteful wall. https://t.co/xnZ0djylRb It's simple: Secretary Ross misled the public to jam through the citizenship question. Intimidating immigrant families to stop them from filling out a census form is pure discrimination, and yet another example of the Trump administration's tactics of fear and division. Relieved to see fed. court block Trump admin's citizenship question from 2020 census. It would have discouraged many NM families from filling out their form — that’s unacceptable.
 
The census must count every New Mexican, or NM &amp; local gov’ts will lose vital federal funding. https://t.co/KtlWiUcGRF WATCH LIVE: I’m on the Senate floor sharing the stories of New Mexicans who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/BBT7kOamfi Our priority is opening up the gov't and taking care of NM. That's why we’ve:

-Sponsored legislation to pay federal workers and contractors
-Voted to fund the government
-Supported @SenateDems' call on the floor for a vote to end the shutdown— but @senatemajldr objected to it In today’s @ABQJournal: New Mexicans are paying the price for the longest shutdown in US history. @MartinHeinrich &amp; I are standing up for federal workers going w/o pay &amp; all New Mexicans who are missing out on vital services.

The #TrumpShutdown must end. https://t.co/KvmbWs8PkI So many New Mexicans have written to me to tell me about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting them and their families. Here are some of their stories: https://t.co/cpGztvM747 I represent a border state. @POTUS doesn’t have the first idea what’s going on in our communities. The president’s language demonizing immigrants &amp; border communities is appalling.

It’s time for the GOP to stop going along with these fear-mongering tactics &amp; stand up to @POTUS. https://t.co/03kjP6lZhZ And when workers are furloughed, or working without pay, the impacts echo throughout their communities— millions miss out on services, local businesses suffer, our safety is compromised. We need to re-open the gov’t, get everyone back to work and get our country back on track. Today should be payday for federal employees across the nation. But for 800,000 hardworking Americans &amp; thousands of New Mexicans, payday will come and go, and they won’t have anything to show for their work— all because of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/hUj62SP6fv Proud to see the House pass Interior Approps bill to fund public lands &amp; tribal programs with bipartisan vote. We need to stop the widespread impacts to tribes &amp; heartbreaking damage to nat’l parks.

@senatemajldr: it’s time for the Senate to vote on this. The shutdown must end. Tribal health &amp; public safety programs should NEVER be used as hostages for political gain. We are talking about trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. The consequences of this shutdown are getting worse every day that this goes on. For tribal communities, #TrumpShutdown consequences are real &amp; dangerous. Federal programs critical to health and public safety—from responding to 911 calls to conducting wellness checks for the elderly— are all impacted by this irrational, unnecessary #TrumpShutdown This shutdown is hurting NM. Take Carlsbad: a shutdown means fewer visitors to national parks like Carlsbad Caverns. That means less business for a community whose economy centers on tourism. Small biz owners can’t afford these ripple effects. We need to re-open the government. https://t.co/HUtgbXuDNC I’m leading a major Senate bill to fix our broken democracy, get corruption out of politics, and give power back to the American people. Read more here: https://t.co/dcMVerhiQC Honored to be chosen again as top Dem on the @SenateApprops subcommittee that handles one of the areas most important to New Mexico—Interior &amp; Environment. I’ll keep working for:
 
-clean air &amp; water
 
-public lands
 
-the arts
 
-Indian Country
 
and much more. This is a pay stub for an air traffic controller, as reported by @POLITICO.
 
$0. That's how much @POTUS values the work these controllers do to keep us safe.
 
Holding livelihoods hostage isn't getting us anywhere. Compromising our aviation workforce is the real security risk. https://t.co/4VIR3NyQhE Another consequence of the #TrumpShutdown: talented federal employees leaving for new jobs. Many of them live paycheck to paycheck. But now their livelihoods are being held hostage, and it's their families and the communities they serve who suffer.
https://t.co/Qh17jRlzDD Today, fellow @SenateDems &amp; I tried to bring a vote on bills to END the shutdown. Not just any bills— ones @senatemajldr &amp; R's supported a few weeks ago
 
But now they’re blocking them.
 
This shutdown is hurting everyday Americans. Why won’t @senateGOP stand up to the President? On Friday, 5,800 people in NM will miss a paycheck. That means missed rent payments &amp; overdue bills. Real people are paying for the president's tantrum.
 
Instead of storming out when he doesn't get his way, @POTUS needs to come to the table— &amp; accept a solution to end this mess. .@Interior should honor the public's voice. They need to extend the comment period on the proposed oil &amp; gas program in the #ArcticRefuge because drilling would permanently damage the land, harm treasured wildlife &amp; derail indigenous way of life. There's no reason to rush it. https://t.co/mZZIctjVt2 .@POTUS admits it: his trip to the border is just a photo op.

All while he's holding federal workers and services hostage—and demonizing our border communities.
 
The Senate needs to vote to open the government. https://t.co/rcW0AdH73z New Mexicans didn’t hear anything new tonight from @POTUS.
 
They certainly didn’t hear a good reason for why @POTUS is holding their livelihoods hostage.
 
@POTUS and @SenateMajLdr need to end this #TrumpShutdown, before it hurts more NM families. Tonight @POTUS will address the nation.
 
We'll likely hear more bizarre talk about what we need at the border — from a president who doesn't know the first thing about the border.
 
But as a border state senator let me tell you: our communities reject the president's wall. RT @CraigCaplan: Udall (D-NM) from Senate floor: "As Democrats stand ready to reopen the government, President Trump plans to address the n… LIVE: I'm speaking out against the #TrumpShutdown on the Senate floor.
 
Democrats have passed solutions to end this mess. But @SenateMajLdr refuses to stand up to @POTUS as he holds the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of Americans hostage. https://t.co/L7e1Tnvq4h Let’s be clear: If @POTUS cared about national security, he wouldn’t have shut down @TSA &amp; @DHSgov— forcing them to work with no pay. But he is putting the American people’s security &amp; livelihoods on the line to extort $ for a wasteful, hateful and ineffective border wall. If there's one thing that's been consistent throughout the Trump administration, it's been their repeated refusal to tell the truth. And it looks like we'll get more of the same when @POTUS addresses the nation tonight. Great piece from @FredWertheimer &amp; @NormEisen, two strong voices in the fight to restore our democracy, on urgency of #HR1.

I’m leading the Senate version of this bill, because America's working families are done with government of, by &amp; for the powerful. https://t.co/gXg72cmgqb Day 17 of #TrumpShutdown. @POTUS is hurting ~800,000 federal employees for the sake of his hateful wall. Thousands in NM are going without pay.
 
@POTUS needs to stop using hardworking Americans as pawns. Dems have acted to reopen government. Time for @senatemajldr to step up. On this day in 1912, New Mexico was admitted to the Union as our 47th state. Happy birthday to the Land of Enchantment! https://t.co/4DdECqUWKQ 800,000 people across the US—thousands of them in NM— are going w/o pay due to the #TrumpShutdown.

Forcing hardworking Americans to struggle is unconscionable. 

Democrats are offering bipartisan solutions. But Sen. McConnell won't stand up to @POTUS. https://t.co/PWqZyuxa3X It’s time for @POTUS to end the shutdown. The House passed gov’t funding based on bipartisan Senate bills. There’s no good reason not to sign it— President Trump is putting New Mexicans’ livelihoods at risk if he doesn’t. And Native communities are in danger, as @USIndianAffairs services like clearing dangerous roads are on hold. The safety of tribal communities should NOT be a pawn in the fight over Trump’s anti-immigrant wall. Thousands of NM workers are federal employees &amp; contractors who aren't getting paid. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting NM families who have bills to pay &amp; mouths to feed— not to mention the massive impact this will have on our economy.

NM is paying a high price for Trump’s tantrum. THREAD: @POTUS says he’d be fine with the shutdown lasting “months or even years.” But that would simply be a disaster for NM.

Because for NM's federal workers &amp; Native communities, the #TrumpShutdown isn’t just inconvenient— it’s potentially devastating. https://t.co/XKssrSgNem Excited about the bold reforms proposed in H.R. 1— a much-needed bill to fight corruption, fix our broken political system and put democracy back in the people’s hands. I’m proud to lead the Senate counterpart to this transformative, urgent legislation. https://t.co/V3o0BaiRUR Proud that NM represents the historic diversity of the new Congress: @RepBenRayLujan &amp; @RepTorresSmall are part of largest @HispanicCaucus ever, &amp; @RepDebHaaland is one of Congress' 1st Native women.

Diversity in Congress means diversity of ideas as we fight for a stronger NM. Today the House votes to reopen government using Senate bills passed w/overwhelming bipartisan support— even from @SenateMajLdr. There's NO reason for @POTUS not to sign.

Because every minute of the gov’t shutdown is another minute hardworking New Mexicans are hung out to dry. New Mexico is one of the states hardest hit by the #TrumpShutdown. NM's thousands of federal employees work hard to protect our public lands, our borders and our nation. But they don't know when they'll see another paycheck. https://t.co/ScoRMxK8zj Our democracy is at a crisis point. So in the 116th Congress, Democrats are working to end the culture of corruption in our politics. I'm proud to lead the Senate bill containing critical reforms to put democracy back in the hands of the people. https://t.co/0Kiasqufqn Congratulations to @MartinHeinrich, @RepBenRayLujan, @RepDebHaaland, and @RepTorresSmall on your swearing in today. Our delegation is going to be hard at work for New Mexico, and I’m excited to partner with you to stand up for NM values and priorities in Congress. https://t.co/AChuhknzfD #NationalPark designations aren't just symbolic. They're a promise from the gov't to safeguard treasured lands. But the #TrumpShutdown leaves them unprotected.

@POTUS: end the shutdown, let park staff get back to work &amp; get public lands out of harm's way. https://t.co/a8WbDqiuQS Congratulations to my good friend &amp; the new governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham! It was an honor for Jill &amp; I to be a part of your swearing in today.

Your vision for a stronger New Mexico is inspirational— I can’t wait to work with you to make it a reality. #aimhigh https://t.co/xldCJh2w4Z Happy New Year! Jill and I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy 2019. This year, I’m renewing my commitment to working together, standing up for the truth and fighting for New Mexico’s values &amp; priorities in the Senate. https://t.co/eoigUlprYI Democrats are offering a responsible path forward to end the #TrumpShutdown, reopen the government, and provide certainty for New Mexico workers, families, and our economy. It's time for GOP leaders to end this madness. My full statement: https://t.co/o7Wr4qoLaH Not only would closing the border hurt our economies and communities— it’s illegal. And above all else, it’s a betrayal of our core American values.  
https://t.co/LaMd7m866x .@POTUS is threatening to devastate economies in NM &amp; all border states— let alone the entire nation— for brazen political purposes.

This behavior is yet another sign he is dangerously unfit for office. https://t.co/B5TKXhziY1 We're requesting an immediate @DHSgov &amp; @CBP investigation of 8-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gomez’s death— the second child to die this month in CBP custody. This is beyond alarming, and demands immediate attention. The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/CLeoUMHetu At the start of the new Congress, I’ll request @SenatorWicker &amp; @SenatorCantwell call a @SenateCommerce hearing about this incident, so we can discuss ways to prevent this kind of critical infrastructure from failing in the future. https://t.co/Ruo9le3XAx My office is monitoring the @centurylink outage affecting many here in New Mexico and across the US. I'll continue to work to ensure reliable backups to prevent future disruptions to critical services. https://t.co/aRdrjgnwY2 No matter what @POTUS says, we know this is a #TrumpShutdown— take his word for it:

"I'm proud to shut down the gov’t"

"I would totally be willing to shut it down"

"I would have no problem doing a shutdown"

“I’d love to see a shutdown"

"Our country needs a good shutdown" .@POTUS puts polluters over people every chance he gets. I won’t stop working for the safety of all America’s communities.

That’s why I’m leading legislation to ban dangerous pesticides like chlorpyrifos— and why I’m fighting Trump rollbacks that leak more methane into our air. MUST READ from @nytimes: the Trump administration's destructive attacks on environmental protections are having devastating impacts on the health of everyday Americans. https://t.co/VviNs5fBqj A day after another child died in US custody, @SecNielsen blames everyone but the Trump admin for its callous mishandling of the humanitarian crisis at the border.
 
Meanwhile, @POTUS shut down @DHSgov to try and get his border wall as ransom.
 
This is no way to run a country. https://t.co/udtcg9A9IX This is devastating news on a day when so many around the world are holding their families close. We can never become desensitized to children dying in US custody. We need a full investigation into this horrible tragedy. And we urgently need humanity in our immigration policies. https://t.co/4hiS0UmLB3 Jill and I want to wish a Merry Christmas to all who celebrate! I hope everyone has a warm holiday full of joy. https://t.co/J5yXaOn5tf On Christmas Eve, here's more bizarre talk about border security from a president who clearly doesn't know the first thing about the border. Republican leaders need to stand up to the president, put an end to this madness &amp; reopen the gov't, before our country suffers even more. https://t.co/ylAlyGEQx0 Last night, @POTUS let the #TrumpShutdown begin.

Rather than agree to a bipartisan compromise, he's holding the gov't hostage in an anti-immigrant tantrum.

Who pays the price? Hardworking New Mexicans who don't know when they'll see their next paycheck. .@POTUS called a shutdown a “small price to pay”— tell that to families in New Mexico &amp; across the nation who don't know when they’ll see their next paycheck if the gov’t shuts down.

Trump claims to care about working people, but doesn't mind extorting them to suit his agenda. The Trump administration says we can’t afford investments in:

-healthcare
-the environment
-education
-good jobs
-SNAP

But they want to hold us hostage for $5 billion in taxpayer dollars? Backwards doesn’t even begin to describe this administration’s priorities. #TrumpShutdown New Mexicans can’t afford the #TrumpShutdown, and we don’t support a border wall. https://t.co/zaImMDr1vP My flight from NM just landed &amp; I’m on my way to vote NO on Trump holding government hostage to waste &gt;$5 billion in taxpayer money.
 
The Senate already passed a bipartisan bill to keep government open. Put an end to this madness so New Mexico families can enjoy holiday season. .@POTUS couldn’t make it more clear: he is more than happy to shut down the government for the sake of his wasteful border wall.
 
Ignoring your responsibilities to the American people isn’t leadership. It’s a temper tantrum. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/8W8F9OOB50 With his latest anti-immigrant tantrum, @POTUS is threatening the livelihoods of thousands of hardworking New Mexicans if he doesn't get his border wall.
 
He’s holding the gov’t hostage for the sake of his own wasteful agenda. That isn’t leadership. That’s political extortion. The Trump admin has cut corners throughout their reckless attempts to sell off the Arctic refuge: shutting out experts, ignoring science &amp; now rushing a key environmental impact report.

But the fight isn’t over. We will keep working to protect the Arctic.
https://t.co/4WYc1BuQim My Farmers of Tomorrow Act is good news for NM, and I’m proud it passed in the #FarmBill. Getting the next generation into agriculture is key to a thriving economy. That’s why this bill opens up financial resources for young farmers and ranchers to get started. The Trump admin is proposing SNAP restrictions that will hurt working families in NM and across the US. @POTUS already tried to get this passed— the Senate rejected it.

Since democracy didn't work in his favor, he's trying to write the rules by himself? We won’t stand for it. Syria—like Yemen—needs a diplomatic solution. And Congress needs to reassert its Constitutional authority over the use of military force. https://t.co/XMZp1mKMfA There are legitimate questions about the reasoning &amp; process of @POTUS' Syria announcement. But we must remember Congress never authorized de-facto invasion of Syria in the first place–-so I have opposed using U.S. forces in this complicated civil war, no matter who is president. We are demanding immediate oversight hearings on the death of Jakelin Caal Maquin, the 7yr old who died in @CBP custody.
 
We need answers. We need to make sure a tragedy like this doesn’t happen again. We need #JusticeforJakelin https://t.co/sgD6Qd8xqy If Big Tech companies won’t protect children, will they protect anyone?
 
After all, reports show @facebook trading user data away without notice. Congress needs to work together on a real privacy law that holds Big Tech accountable.  https://t.co/oDpQRgkXoP Children’s safety should be one of our primary concerns, and there are few places more precarious for young people than the internet. It’s time for the @FTC to crack down on companies like @google when they refuse to take children’s privacy seriously. https://t.co/GApInmcGad WATCH LIVE- I’m speaking on the Senate floor right now with a message from New Mexico’s border communities: We won’t stand by while @POTUS holds the gov’t hostage for the sake of his wasteful, offensive wall. https://t.co/AisVHPC26s More than one year after Las Vegas, an overdue but important step: a commonsense gun safety measure that will save lives.

We must build on this – Congress needs to be proactive &amp; work together on real solutions that will keep the American people safe from senseless gun violence. https://t.co/OE5hkohqzd It’s been so exciting following @OfficialChevel’s journey all the way to the @NBCTheVoice Finals. Joining all of New Mexico tonight in rooting for you! No matter the outcome, you’ve made Farmington and all of NM so proud. https://t.co/m1r5pMqIYK I spoke with @TheTakeaway about my demand for a full investigation into the death of Jakelin Caal Maquin, a 7yr old girl who died in CPB custody. Her death is a tragedy, &amp; we need answers. We cannot stand for this administration’s inhumane immigration policies. #JusticeforJakelin https://t.co/0ij2BLd2o5 A new study finds 1 in 5 HS seniors are vaping--an unprecedented jump. We must take action now to protect the next generation from a lifetime of addiction. My bill with @senorrinhatch would keep e-cigs away from schools and nicotine out of our kids' lungs. https://t.co/02TQGWCyj4 My thoughts are with the families of Chamberino as they recover from a major fuel spill. Kinder Morgan must keep local residents informed, this spill must be fully remediated &amp; steps need to be taken to ensure these accidents are prevented in the future. https://t.co/ftqVMilwdM This dangerous ruling could take healthcare away from MILLIONS.
 
Without the #ACA, hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans could lose their care. Unconscionable. So as long as the GOP is fighting to take away your care, I’m going to be here fighting to protect it. https://t.co/sTjAVVUuYG Ryan Zinke repeatedly put the interests of industry ahead of the people &amp; the land that it was his job to safeguard. Instead of catering to corporate lobbyists, we need an @Interior Sec. who will listen to Tribes &amp; the American people—who want our land &amp; environment protected. https://t.co/dhlM7WX5zu Have you signed up for healthcare?

Her death raises significant questions about @DHSgov leadership and response to the humanitarian crisis at the border. https://t.co/cfb959OAkj It’s been six years since 20 innocent children were murdered at #SandyHook. On this tragic anniversary, my heart is with the loved ones of the children who lost their lives that day.
 
If Congress wants to honor them, we must come together and act to end the violence.
