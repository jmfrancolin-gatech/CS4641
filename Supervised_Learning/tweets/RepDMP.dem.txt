The Venezuelan people cannot restore stability and democracy to their country without humanitarian aid, but neither can they restore them with the specter of Russian forces looming behind them, propping up Maduro‚Äôs illegitimate regime. #VenezuelaLibreYa https://t.co/Y4xSAN0MZl And I announced $718,150 in Federal Grants for FIU Medical Research. https://t.co/g5iP57KsSE I met with constituents at our district office to discuss how I can help them in Congress. I rallied with Venezuelan Americans and supporters at an event in support of democracy in Venezuela. I attended a meeting with the American Federation of Teachers Executive Board, where I spoke about the importance of public education. Co-sponsored legislation to provide for the administration of certain national monuments, to establish a National Monument Enhancement Fund, and to establish certain wilderness areas in the States of New Mexico and Nevada. Co-sponsored legislation to assess and mitigate threats posed by Russian-Venezuelan cooperation, and for other purposes. I co-sponsored legislation to support the #GreenNewDeal I questioned Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker at the @HouseJudiciary hearing, where I asked the basic question of whether or not the government should protect the rights of transgender people. I also sought answers about how non-partisan his former organization really was. I presided over the floor as the first South American immigrant to ever do so, and during a special order hour lead by formerly-undocumented immigrant, Rep. Adriano Espaillat -- a monumental moment for American immigrants! I participated in my first @TransportDems Hearing, where I spoke of the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure that can withstand Florida weather. I attended my first State of the Union Address, where I wore suffragette white with my colleagues and my guest Michelle Garcia, a women‚Äôs health advocate. https://t.co/Ew60uo5AVy I participated in the first @HouseJudiciary on gun violence in almost a decade, where I shared my own personal story and the story of Carnell Williams-Thomas, a two-year old in #FL26 who lost his life to a bullet. https://t.co/Kv9JknjMbY This week was full of excitement. From heated committee hearings to #SOTU to meetings with constituents, I had a full week. Read my #WeeklyWrapUp below! @SaraRamirez I wasn‚Äôt buying it either! I won‚Äôt sit back and let him pretend he ISN‚ÄôT attacking the LGBTQ community when we all know what‚Äôs really happening. RT @HispanicCaucus: ‚ÄúDo you believe that members of the LGBT community should not be protected under federal discrimination laws? Yes or no‚Ä¶ Mr. Whitaker's refusal to say whether or not the government should enforce protections for the #LGBTQ community is distressing. Justice ought to be blind, and the rule of law upheld. #WhitakerHearing https://t.co/yAwwuhPspZ After asking my questions, I am still deeply troubled about Matthew Whitaker‚Äôs past supposed ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù work and this Administration‚Äôs refusal to enforce protections for the LGBTQ community. So much for hiring the best people. #WhitakerHearing https://t.co/ULoXbGGkrD We have a constitutional duty of oversight. Mr. Whitaker needs to quit avoiding the truth and start answering questions directly.

https://t.co/ZzcHnJM8u3 I am deeply troubled by Mr. Whitaker‚Äôs inability to directly answer many of the questions being asked at this @HouseJudiciary hearing. #WhitakerHearing I am shocked by the blatant disrespect Mr. Whitaker is showing during this hearing. It is not a decent way to speak to anyone, let alone Members of Congress who are providing oversight on your appointment to serve our country. @HouseJudiciary Staff just got off call w/Administration on Venezuela. Embassy staff is safe. I‚Äôm making sure Guaid√≥‚Äôs government keeps receiving aid to restore democracy and hold free and fair elections soon and I‚Äôll keep pushing for TPS. #VenezuelaLibreYa #SOSVenezuela https://t.co/sIhJ8l3Rew For two years, Congress gave the Trump Administration a blank check, performing zero oversight. That has changed. In the @HouseJudiciary hearing with Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker we‚Äôre getting to the truth. Watch it live:

The President made no mention of plans to work with Democrats to forge a strategy to combat the devastating effects of climate change. Rising sea levels do not care which political party you voted for; this is a worldwide crisis that we cannot solve without American leadership. Today, I will participate in a Judiciary Committee hearing on preventing future gun violence. I am disappointed the President didn‚Äôt recognize the public health crisis gun violence poses, and I will ensure we begin to #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/uw5IE9tW62 The Sebring, FL shooting took place less than two weeks ago. Far too many Americans are dying from gun violence whether through suicide, homicide, a mass shooting, or an accidental death, and Democrats are ready to take action to address the issue. Too many Americans are uninsured or are paying sky-high premiums while their wages do not keep up with these cost increases. I‚Äôd like to thank women‚Äôs health care advocate Michelle Garcia for being my guest this evening and helping me highlight this issue. https://t.co/ssDp0tWQSH If the President actually supported protections for pre-existing conditions, he would not allow and encourage attacks on the Affordable Care Act Republicans have the opportunity to prevent hundreds of thousands of families from hurting again. Instead of treating DREAMers like political pawns to be exchanged for a wasteful wall, the President must back down from his brinkmanship and makes our government work #ForThePeople. While Republicans in Congress were immobilized by the fear of standing up to the President, American families, including 14,000 Floridians, were hurting during the partial government shutdown. #FL26 I hope the President‚Äôs calls for unity were sincere...because we have work to do.

More than 80% of black mothers are the breadwinners for their families. These mothers can‚Äôt afford to only make 63 cents on the dollar compared to white men. I support the #PaycheckFairness Act because I support families. Latina women make 53 cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men. Latinas and their families can‚Äôt afford to wait decades for the wage gap to close. That is why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct #EqualPay I am a proud co-sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct because the gender pay gap hurts women, children, and society as a whole.

While I‚Äôm glad he apologized, his comments show how hard the Latino community must work to be accepted. https://t.co/YCbKcXvSIu The nonpartisan @USCBO reported that the shutdown cost the US economy $11 billion, $3 billion of which is non-recoverable. This shutdown caused permanent damage to people‚Äôs lives and the economy. We must work together to make sure it never happens again.https://t.co/LKEnGa48YG On this day in 2008 the #WoundedWarriorAct was signed into law. The WWA provides much needed protection to those who risk everything for our country. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of work to be done to help our veterans, starting with fixing the VA. https://t.co/9yJZz1V8ob Another step in the right direction. I will continue to be a voice for the peaceful restoration of Venezuela‚Äôs democracy. The hemisphere depends on it. #VenezuelaLibreYa https://t.co/4lYIuqHUi6 On Friday, my vote to reopen the gov't also restored the #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct, legislation to protect women from domestic violence. I will keep fighting on @HouseJudiciary to guarantee equal rights and protections for all women. #ForThePeople https://t.co/ZJGINz6C4o Tomorrow I have my first @HouseJudiciary hearing, focusing on the anti-corruption bill passed my first week in office. I will work to strengthen voting rights and tackle campaign finance reform #ForThePeople https://t.co/KZ8irUM74l The opioid crisis doesn‚Äôt care what zip code you live in, the color of your skin, or what your income is. It affects us all.
We should learn from successful programs to beat the opioid crisis and grow them when we can.
https://t.co/VcJlkVmOTb RT @thebeatdc: The @HouseJudiciary Committee adds new faces, including @RepLou Correa, @RepEscobar, @RepSylviaGarcia, @RepLucyMcBath, @RepD‚Ä¶ To make matters in Venezuela worse, 13,000 doctors have fled the country, resulting in little to no access to medical care. https://t.co/3ePjWdAr3h Today and everyday we remember the more than 6 million people who were murdered in the name of hate and prejudice in the Holocaust. We must stand up against bigotry and protect our brothers and sisters. #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/rKBpEqDw6x Como siempre apoyando al pueblo Venezolano en su lucha por la democracia. Seguir√© trabajando en proyectos de ley para acelerar la asistencia humanitaria para el pa√≠s. https://t.co/kCcAQcTo49 Now that we have a temporary solution to the shutdown, we need to focus on the issues we were elected to tackle. Over 14 percent of #FL26 is without health insurance. We must fix the ACA and provide accessible and affordable healthcare for ALL Americans. https://t.co/7o8QANVhhu https://t.co/2ggZ3x4eor Thanks for having me on the show @DeFede. Tune in to @CBSMiami tomorrow at 8:30am to see our interview! https://t.co/jEKuuII0H9 And today I held a roundtable with the Dade County Farmers Bureau and the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture, Nikki Fried, where we discussed how I can advocate for farmers in Congress. https://t.co/cqaBIqzzjF I stood in solidarity with Venezuela and marched with millions across the world calling for an end Maduro‚Äôs dictatorship. https://t.co/bm5QkJxZmi I attended a breakfast honoring MLK‚Äôs legacy and awarding scholarships to young students of color seeking to create change. https://t.co/aH2X9LKBsm I held a roundtable to discuss how we can provide aid to the Venezuelan people, support democracy, and resist Nicolas Maduro‚Äôs authoritarian regime. https://t.co/9SEOjyb0lQ I spoke with EVTV in my DC office about the importance of restoring democracy and getting humanitarian aid to Venezuela. https://t.co/lgU9PIi54L I signed letters to:
- Advocate for additional funding to restore and protect the Everglades
- Reaffirm our commitment to the Global Fund to Fight Aids
- Support Medicare Part D to help Medicare recipients afford prescriptions I will work hard the next three weeks, and I hope my Republican colleagues will provide long-term funding so we don‚Äôt have another manufactured crisis. Despite the shutdown distraction, I had a busy week. We had a week full of hard work and results. I voted three more times to reopen the government. Finally, today, the President agreed to do the right thing: stop hurting American families and temporarily open the government. https://t.co/eYA7VIkeD1 Thank you to everyone who attended the roundtable today with @DadeCountyAG and @nikkifried. We discussed ways I can advocate for FL farmers in Congress to preserve one of Florida‚Äôs greatest industries: agriculture! https://t.co/064lSIhizS I‚Äôm blessed to be a Floridian on #NationalFloridaDay! The Sunshine State is home to some of the most ecologically diverse habitats in the country and is one of the most visited places in the world. I will continue working to protect our state‚Äôs natural beauty. https://t.co/jpXtAagDKx I‚Äôm pleased the President finally walked back from his reckless position and decided to reopen the government for now. We cannot govern from one manufactured crisis to the next, and I hope Republicans agree to long-term funding measures to avoid another similar crisis. https://t.co/xQjsQdD9BH It is shameful how this administration is treating asylum seekers. Our country is known for being a place where people can escape oppression without fear. We must live up to this American principle and fix our broken immigration system. 
https://t.co/fKYMy3BYyB https://t.co/98HN0OlWZS I worry that a catastrophe has to happen for the President and Republicans in Congress to walk us back from this manufactured crisis. Airport workers warned us weeks ago this could happen. We need to reopen the government now. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/rf9wdNL4Ks If our President and GOP Senators cared more about the American people, 800,000 federal employees would be receiving a paycheck tomorrow. Instead, the Senate GOP just voted down a proposal to re-open the government, ensuring those workers won‚Äôt get paid. https://t.co/N2aZxqovL6 The shutdown is now threatening to end research at FL universities. Programs like these are rapidly losing funding, which could put our country‚Äôs scientific advancement years behind. We must #EndTheShutdown. @UF https://t.co/KZhs8m5KdG We should expect our government to respond to disasters in U.S. territories at the same level as the states. We failed Puerto Rico, and now it is Puerto Ricans who are paying the price. #PuertoRicoSelevanta
https://t.co/xgleUcJIhR https://t.co/FJPoG8Kg3s Still more work to do to help the Venezuelan people and restore democracy, but glad the Administration heard my calls for more humanitarian aid.
https://t.co/5rKJ5gM0qn I am excited to serve on these subcommittees and work on the issues that South Florida sent me to Congress to tackle: fixing our broken immigration system, keeping our country safe and our waters clean, and increasing our resilience to fight against climate change. https://t.co/veqIIjO6lt Mucho m√°s trabajo por delante para ayudar al pueblo venezolano y restaurar la democracia pero la Administraci√≥n me escuch√≥ un dio un buen paso para aumentar el apoyo humanitario.
https://t.co/5rKJ5gM0qn .@DryTortugasNPS @EvergladesNPS @BiscayneNPS You are the greatest National Parks in the country! It‚Äôs a shame the government shutdown is keeping people from experiencing your full natural beauty. #NationalComplimentDay #EndTheShutdown Callous doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe this Administration. ‚ÄúA little pain,‚Äù as Wilbur Ross calls missing two paychecks, is destroying livelihoods and putting our national security at risk. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/4wLQ7wKRme If this wall was really about keeping Americans safe, the GOP would pay the women and men putting their lives on the line for our country. We must make sure they get paid. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/hlk4x7TRmR Our Coast guard members are committed to service and to our country. We should expect this Administration to have the same commitment. The Senate has an opportunity today to #EndtheShutdown #ForThePeople https://t.co/8RaplD49Fi 10.
10 times I‚Äôve voted to reopen the government.
These are bills that passed Congress unanimously in December before Trump threw a fit over his wasteful wall.
Enough brinkmanship. We can't negotiate while the government is closed. #EndTheShutdown
https://t.co/0V5AFPB38e Yet another way the #GOPshutdown is harming Americans--The shutdown is threatening to delay the bipartisan criminal justice bill signed just last month. Thousands of inmates and their families are in the dark about whether they will be released or not: https://t.co/juMHbC4zgN RT @VOANoticias: Congresista Debbie Mucarsel Powell se dirige ante manifestantes venezolanos en Washington D.C. #venezuela https://t.co/fJT‚Ä¶ Interesting that the Republican-controlled Senate is on recess and hasn‚Äôt voted once to reopen the government. Meanwhile, the Democrat-controlled House has voted 9 times and counting. #WheresMitch? #WheresRubio? #WheresScott? Desde Washington, estoy con el pueblo venezolano. No dejaremos de luchar hasta que Venezuela sea libre, un pa√≠s democr√°tico y que el dictador y usurpador no sea m√°s el l√≠der de Venezuela.
#23Ene #23DeEnero #23EneroYoSalgo https://t.co/6aw3OlD4cU RT @WLRN: Miami Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell met with Venezuelan expat leaders on eve of mass anti-Maduro protests. 
https://t.co/i‚Ä¶ El pueblo venezolano est√° sufriendo bajo la dictadura brutal del usurpador Nicolas Maduro. Es un l√≠der ileg√≠timo quien rob√≥ las elecciones. Apoyo al pueblo venezolano y continuar√© hasta que la democracia sea restaurada. #23deEnero #23ene #23EneroYoSalgo https://t.co/cuo7BkHll7 I will keep working until this humanitarian crisis is resolved. #23ene
