I am proud to support the Veteran Treatment Court Improvement Act, which would provide counseling, care, and support our veterans' transition into civilian life. https://t.co/ayTy4oFzi2 I strongly support the decision to formally withdraw from this failed one-sided treaty. My full statement on withdrawal from the INF Treaty: https://t.co/42YE6Mh4VL I strongly supported passage of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 in the House today. Civilian federal employees go above and beyond to serve our country and our community. They have earned our support. My full statement: https://t.co/6e3XZwa2cE As a long-term advocate of justice for victims of sexual violence, I’m joining my colleague @RepDaveJoyce in introducing a resolution today urging states to improve &amp; streamline services for survivors of sexual assault. We must re-open the government and pay the 800,000 federal employees who have suffered during this shutdown. This is only a short-term solution. During these upcoming three weeks, @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer must negotiate and deliver necessary funding for border security. Homelessness is a real issue facing many who have served our country honorably, &amp; we must do more to support them. As a previous cosponsor of the Homeless Veterans Legal Services Act, I am proud to continue to support bolstering the resources available to our nation’s veterans. https://t.co/aQcXpxzttP As a previous chairman of this subcommittee, I am honored to be returning to a leadership role on Strategic Forces.

I support this solution to fully fund border security and reopen the government. ‘No’ is not a solution. @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer should stop opposing re-opening our government and securing our border. Dear Ted:

Thank you for proving my point. You are 1/535 Legislators. So is Nancy Pelosi. Contrary to her claims, she is not equal to the President. She cannot take any action in the house without 218 votes. The President can act with his pen, as he did yesterday. https://t.co/2rt97og29g The Missile Defense Review provides a timely and necessary response to our adversaries’ advancements in capabilities.

Happy birthday, Zoe Dell! https://t.co/EFqimOiLX1 Happy #FlagDay! Yesterday I presented Spencer and Hayden from #OH10 with flags flown over the U.S. Capitol during their visit to DC with their grandparents. https://t.co/O5SBH79xiZ Yesterday I asked @DeptofDefense if they're finding commonalities in the instances of aviation mishaps.

Click here to watch➡https://t.co/UA0yvIXfaA Yesterday @afspnational advocates from #OH10 stopped by my office in DC to discuss #SuicidePrevention. https://t.co/Z3AX6juvVD It was an honor to join @ICSC today for a panel with @RepAnthonyBrown, @rep_stevewomack, and @RepVeasey to discuss my Brownfields Redevelopment Tax Incentive Reauthorization Act of 2018. #READ more about the bill here: https://t.co/Und19aBLMZ https://t.co/jNw6gmQkgJ .@nikiinthehouse find me during votes. I challenge you to a rock paper scissors match. 

Footnote: Wright beats paper. https://t.co/ykMYzoNeaq I am cautiously optimistic that this summit was a step towards making the world safer. However, I continue to remain skeptical about Kim Jong Un’s commitment to denuclearization. The U.S. and our allies must work together to verify any action taken by North Korea. .@TrimbleCorpNews's investment in #OH10 shows the cost effectiveness of doing business here. #WATCH via @ABC22FOX45: https://t.co/6Gj5q17raR The panel I assembled chose Judge Rice to be the namesake of the federal building in downtown Dayton, a fitting tribute for one of #OH10's most dedicated public servants. Yesterday’s passage of this bill in the Senate brings us one step closer to formally naming this building. https://t.co/ITT9Gc3UhN .@RepEvanJenkins &amp; I have re-introduced #CRIBact to help organizations like @BrigidsPath in #OH10 get funding to treat babies going through withdrawal from opioids.

#WATCH via @WDTN: https://t.co/opMaXyUZ7h Thank you to all who have put country before self and made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. #MemorialDay https://t.co/QwcwRngi0h I fought for key provisions in this bill to bolster #OH10, ensure the safety of our men &amp; women in uniform, &amp; keep our country secure. I will continue to fight for these provisions as we move into working with the Senate on the final defense bill. #READ: https://t.co/sIW2wvPlSs All of the provisions I included in #FY19NDAA remained in the bill &amp; overwhelmingly passed the House today, bringing #OH10 1 step closer to getting $182 million for a new building at @WrightPattAFB.
