We lost a great and honorable man, former Representative John David Dingell Jr., who served in Congress for nearly six decades. John served this country with honor in wartime and with distinction as a legislator. May John's legacy guide us forward and serve as an inspiration. In this era of the 10-minute news cycle, good politics "requires" immediate decisions. But good legislating has always required study and hard work --- and that can take a few days. The #GreenNewDeal (H. Res. 109) may be the most wide-ranging and consequential measure put before the Congress in recent years. I look forward to analyzing it this weekend. I met with Dr. Al-Issa, who heads the Muslim World League. I urged him to use his influence in the Muslim World to at least eliminate capital punishment for adultery, blasphemy, apostasy, or being in the LGBT community. The response was not as encouraging as you would like. https://t.co/SC9X2OPbCk I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen the US-India relationship. @MarkWarner @JohnCornyn @RepHolding https://t.co/Q24bsUsRWV As the Co-Chair of the India Caucus and Chair of the House Asia Subcommittee, I had the pleasure of hosting Ambassador Shringla’s congressional welcome reception tonight. @DZalkaliani, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Georgia paid a visit to my office today. We discussed my support for H.R. 6219 the Georgian Support Act as well as US aid to Georgia, particularly in the Georgian region of #SamtskheJavakheti https://t.co/w6bOxnEDry ...Both of which seem to be in jeopardy following recent political detentions and assassination attempts. https://t.co/oWSn5UUFSX Today I met with the recovering Chief Whip of the Chadema Party, the largest opposition party in the Tanzanian parliament, @TunduLissu and his wife Alicia Magabe to discuss democracy and human rights in #Tanzania.... It was a pleasure to meet with President George Tsereteli @GTsereteli of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly @oscepa and discuss U.S.-European relations. Mr. Tsereteli is also a member of the parliament in Georgia. https://t.co/Tig70iD7HK Happy to meet with Korean-American veterans of the Vietnam War, some of which are Valley Residents! Thank you for your service to our country. https://t.co/VNdYP9vAqq Michael and his family have endured unimaginable pain during this ordeal. We must do all we can to ensure Michael’s release and safe return home. https://t.co/mFceEQ11ak Today I met with Helen Nguyen, the wife of Michael Nguyen who is being unjustly detained in Vietnam for nearly 7 months without formal charges. Michael’s family is not allowed to visit him. (Still waiting on @TuckerCarlson who promised to discuss Trump’s tax bill as soon as it was proposed) I’ll be on @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews a bit after 9 pm PST to share my thoughts on the #StateOfTheUnion. I believe it is important for Democrats to appear on Fox, even though they rarely invite me and often cancel. First #SOTU in history when a President began by demanding that Congress not investigate him. .@WorldBank has lent $7.8 billion to China since 2016. If @realDonaldTrump wants to save money, he can end this practice. At a hearing in December, I questioned David Malpass, Trump’s nominee for World Bank President, who made good points. https://t.co/jeG8ERnCgb I was proud to join my colleagues on a letter sent to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan demanding he stop the implementation of #Trump’s ban on transgender patriots who wish to serve our country through military service. We must #ProtectTransTroops. This month, we celebrate the contributions made by African-Americans that shape the beliefs and values of all people. #BlackHistoryMonth My Rabbi was right. There wouldn’t be a Shofar without the Rams. Go L.A. #SuperBowl @RamsNFL RT @BobbyScott: My statement with Senators @timkaine and @MarkWarner urging Governor Northam to resign. https://t.co/caAx6Im0Ga Appears the #President is misinformed when he claims on @FaceTheNation that we have 40,000 troops in South Korea. It's under 30,000. My letter, found here https://t.co/BcwVTE0XFO, lays out all the reasons. This is actually a win for the Russians, and we take the blame for killing yet another agreement. #Trump’s decision to pull out of the INF now is another ill-advised decision by his administration. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee with jurisdiction over nonproliferation, I oppose this move and urged the administration not to take it. I'm pleased to announce that a 15 day extension to register for assistance from @fema has been granted for those affected by the #WoolseyFire. Please follow this link for more information: 

https://t.co/Bx65OKiQed .@RepGwenMoore exemplified bravery and grace. Her story is just one example of why we must not relent in our fight to ensure that all Americans have coverage for preexisting conditions and have access to affordable and quality healthcare. https://t.co/nyOn78W2YR I also spoke at length with @HEBobiWine about the importance of democracy, respect for human rights and ensuring stability, not just in Uganda, but in the region as a whole. #PeoplePower https://t.co/yCr9pnhJBU It was a pleasure to greet my friend @HEBobiWine and discuss pressing issues facing #Uganda and the greater region. We exchanged our concerns over Uganda’s role in military transfers to South Sudan and Uganda’s possible involvement in the DRC. Good Move 

https://t.co/wc9G3yk9b4 It was a pleasure to meet with @SEC_News Chairman Clayton today. We discussed protecting investors. I laid out the many reasons, both legal and policy, why the SEC should not change its policy on shareholder class action lawsuits. https://t.co/YpUIi4j3MP I strongly support the state of New York's efforts to call upon corporations to ensure their workforce is inclusive of people with disabilities. I met today with @CalPERS and discussed the importance of disability inclusion in their investments. https://t.co/RzAJX9Aat3 It was a pleasure to meet with the @VEDC_business to discuss strategies for providing support to small businesses in the Valley. https://t.co/dauBYZ2P7m These incidents constitute a violation of the federal hate-crime statues and I will urge the @FBI to investigate and for federal prosecutors to prosecute to the full extent of the law. I strongly condemn this hateful act of vandalism. It is particularly cruel to those whose family members died in the Armenian Genocide. I have been informed that Turkish flags have been posted outside and inside of the Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School, and other Armenian schools and churches in Southern California. I hope to welcome Ambassador @HarshShringla to the Valley soon. As the incoming co-chair of the India Caucus, it was great to meet with the new Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Mr. @HarshShringla. I’ve had the opportunity to meet with every Indian Ambassador during this century and have hosted 3 of the Ambassadors in the San Fernando Valley. https://t.co/MqeUf4GJIy On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we honor and remember the 6 million Jews who were murdered and commit ourselves to continuing the fight against bigotry, anti-semitism, and intolerance. #WeRemember #Trump allows the government to open for 3 weeks. Let’s keep it open. And let’s pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform: border security and permanent relief for #Dreamers and millions of long-term U.S. residents who have not committed violent crimes. It will be similar to the bill I introduced last Congress with @SenMarkey and @marcorubio. 

https://t.co/ITjXUEfD4U That is why I will soon be introducing legislation to ensure Congress votes on any nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. The bill will deter Saudi Arabia from developing a nuclear weapon. Saudi Arabia appears to have secretly built a ballistic missile production facility. This once again underscores the need to get strident restrictions on its proposed nuclear program. 

https://t.co/PkCyr8IPAx .@TSA announced that they have found funding to provide employees with transit and parking benefits. @TSA employees deserve to be compensated with more than a consolation prize. Trump must stop jeopardizing our national security by holding federal wages hostage. #EndtheShutdown The only one of the two bills that will reach Trump’s desk is the one to open government till February 8.  Will he dare veto it after it garners support of Senate Republicans? Not sure Mitch is making White House happy. Not sure he cares. https://t.co/wRVOac3H9D Good news! And a nod to mediator @MayorOfLA Eric Garcetti. https://t.co/c4flKjTe7A As a senior member of @FSCDems, I will be introducing legislation to prevent credit rating agencies from lowering the credit scores of federal employees and contractors if they can’t make payments during a government #shutdown and 60 days after the shutdown ends. In Singapore, Trump capitulated to Kim Jong Un – handing North Korea a propaganda coup in exchange for empty words. During a second summit, he must deliver concrete, verifiable commitments from Pyongyang. https://t.co/8xFHLF2Lsv While we don't know what evidence supports Buzzfeed's charges, we do have sworn testimony from a highly credible witness on the record of impeachable offenses committed in the first 5 months that #trump was in office.  See my analysis below. https://t.co/x9ud1LcxtT If the reports in @BuzzFeed are true @realDonaldTrump should resign or be impeached. #Trump prepares to cave. https://t.co/ZHV0KmTrnC The Administration has claimed that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census is part of Trump’s Latino Empowerment Program.

A crisis is a terrible thing to waste. Soon, Trump will claim authority under the NEA to divert money from military housing to his Wall. Court fight to follow. If Trump wins, military housing is defunded. #TrumpSpeech won't cause Congress to fund the Wall. His real reason for the speech and his upcoming border visit is to claim there's a crisis which he will use to invoke the National Emergencies Act. Met with Erik Mandt and Martin Ramirez of the @NATCA. Discussed the effects of the #shutdown, working without pay, the need for more air traffic controllers, and airport noise and flight patterns over southern San Fernando Valley. https://t.co/bCOiaxj864 RT @CountyofLA: Residents whose homes were damaged by the #WoolseyFire have until Friday (Jan 11) to apply for @FEMA aid.

So filing Articles is necessary to avoid taking a step backward. I believe that Obstruction of Justice is the clearest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump.  Read my analysis published in the Huffington Post here. https://t.co/x9ud1LcxtT Today, I reintroduced Articles of #Impeachment against @realDonaldTrump with @RepAlGreen.  I have not changed the text from the Articles I first introduced in July 2017. https://t.co/LUkI6pyWiX .@realDonaldTrump obstructed justice. @Jim_Jordan doesn’t even try to argue to the contrary.

https://t.co/k280bW9Arg Since 1998, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act has saved 67 million acres of rainforest. Today, the House passed a bill I introduced with @RepSteveChabot &amp; @SenRobPortman to reauthorize this program, which has already passed the Senate. It now awaits the President’s signature. I introduced the Uighur Intervention and Global Humanitarian Unified Response (UIGHUR) Act with @RepTedYoho. Will be reintroducing this bill next year.  Read my press release here: https://t.co/tXKciCZRu3 #UighurMuslims As I've said, a government that cannot be trusted with a bone saw, should not be trusted with a nuclear weapon.

Pleasure to meet today with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. We discussed defending Ukrainian democracy. That includes its territorial integrity and its elections. https://t.co/v71UEvkbxn At the same time, Trump has refused to impose sanctions on major Chinese banks that work with North Korea. He cancelled military exercises. We got little or nothing — so far. Our highest priority must be to get North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile capabilities in return for some U.S. concessions, as part of a phased process of denuclearization, action-for-action. The result of President Trump’s dithering on North Korea after the Singapore Summit is that Pyongyang is expanding its nuclear and missile capabilities, as revealed by @MIIS https://t.co/GkmKjyhp2X The #TariffMan (@realDonaldTrump) continues to be the only person applauding his trade policy while trade deficits rise, more jobs are sent overseas, the stock market plummets, and American families face greater uncertainty. https://t.co/Z7NSsBPwjt RT @csunorthridge: A message from #CSUN Chief of Police Anne Glavin regarding the hateful, offensive, threatening graffiti in Sierra Hall i… As Ranking Member of the Asia Subcommittee, I’m committed to securing justice for the #Rohingya.

The object of Trump’s “plan” was to force China to buy more from the USA. Now he claims victory because #China will resume agricultural purchases, perhaps as much as they were buying before #Trump. Today, the nation is mourning the loss of our beloved President George Herbert Walker Bush. We will forever remember his compassion, sacrifice, commitment and patriotism. The life and legacy of President Bush will forever remain. My prayers are with the Bush family.

We also passed legislation that will require the FAA to consider diverging flight paths and adjusting departure procedures to address community concerns over noise. Although more work needs to be done, I will continue to fight for quieter skies over the San Fernando Valley. I will also meet with the Acting @FAANews Administrator on Election Day in order to demonstrate the impact these changes have on our community and identify ways to reduce aviation noise. I have been working to combat the plague of airplane noise in the Valley. On October 18, I addressed the Hollywood Burbank Airport Meeting and expressed my strong opposition to their proposed changes to flight routes that would increase noise over the San Fernando Valley. SJP has declared its support for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - which glorifies the murder of Jewish civilians, and which the Obama State Department listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Within a month after the most deadly anti-Semitic murders in America, UCLA will host the national conference of SJP, an anti-Semitic organization. Sadly, UCLA will provide its facilities at the subsidized “student organization” rate.

For the record, I never said anything about a depression. What I did say is that we would have lost the lion’s share of $700 billion if they had been able to stick with their plan and just buy toxic assets. https://t.co/8gaH4ZutZ4 I applaud Governor @JerryBrownGov for restoring #NetNeutrality rules in California. I will work with California to protect an open internet by fighting the Trump administration's lawsuit which attempts to block this important legislation. “It is idiotic to put a shot clock on the F.B.I.
