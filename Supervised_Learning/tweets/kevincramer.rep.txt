Thanks to all who came out—especially the Veterans who have made this all possible. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/XKR4UsiLTY It’s been a great evening visiting with @NDGOP volunteers and field staff as they hit the doors and continue to #LeadRight here in Fargo. They’re energized and fired up! #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/zBNPcYY7eU Thank you for visiting Grand Forks! https://t.co/97Qt1Y0VNe Thanks to sound, pro-growth policies coming from the White House and GOP congressional majority, our economy is booming. A new era of prosperity is here. #VoteCramer #NDSen https://t.co/FPo5AvXZ4m There is no more important American institution than the family &amp; I am honored to receive the endorsement ⁦@FPAofND⁩.  https://t.co/BeBccWZYkH .@VP Pence has received his very own North Dakota jersey, honoring an historic and legendary hockey tradition. Thanks to @UNDCRs for making it happen! @UNDmhockey #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/hnedTT2kae No trip to Grand Forks is complete without a Red Pepper run! #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/fz66cegAu2 Let's give Vice President @mike_pence a warm welcome to North Dakota! #VoteCramer #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/5RfK1I2ewV Ultimately, free and fair trade should prevail and eliminate the necessity of aid for our producers. #NDSen #NDPol I am grateful that our producers are now getting some aid in line with what I previously suggested to the Administration. China continues to act in an unfair manner which requires a tough negotiating position from the United States, in the global market place. We’re enthused to be welcoming @vp Pence to Grand Forks tomorrow morning. This Administration continues to be a strong partner to North Dakota. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/ZReCBd0GAd I appreciate the support and endorsement from my friends in the @ACUConservative. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/37JzuHIdvI I cast my vote in support of the VA Mission Act, allowing the expansion of private care for veterans. This legislation is vitally important to N. Dakota, where veterans must travel great distances to see a VA doctor or the local facility cannot provide the care they need. #NDSen https://t.co/vnf2RlD7xM Thank you Minot for hosting an awesome State Fair Parade! It was so much fun! The #CramerCrew enjoyed seeing everyone this morning. We have a great momentum going in the campaign and we’re excited for the coming months. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/phqabAIMHS As our nation’s agriculture policy is finalized for the next 5 years, I’m looking forward to a seat at the table to deliver for our producers. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/YIx8SSWzbi Talking about the politics of SCOTUS with @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness https://t.co/4oOHSkH5yC Sanctuary cities are an affront to the rule of law in this country. That’s why I’ve co-sponsored legislation in the House to de-fund sanctuary cities. I’ll do the same in the U.S. Senate. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/t0L2qBMMrS "Cramer never spoke about cutting medicare or social security. Valley News Live would have to rate the claim by Senate Majority PAC as innacurate." #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/h2UdbChZG4 Thanks to all who joined the #CramerCrew in Beulah, Bowman, Steele &amp; Cooperstown this weekend! Your support and time is much appreciated as we move toward the finish line. #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/lgs3dmhEii .@realDonaldTrump: "You need a Senator that doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota but votes like they're from North Dakota--and that's Kevin Cramer.” #NDSen https://t.co/TX5mG51uY1 July 25th will be a memorable day in @GrandForksCity https://t.co/mPkhRSURLh Get ready ⁦@GrandForksCity⁩ for a visitor. Details to follow soon. https://t.co/Wj6z6xSi33 For North Dakota, you could not do better than Judge Kavanaugh and that’s why I expect he will get both votes from both of North Dakota’s United States Senators. #NDSen #NDPol
 https://t.co/ioqdKKgllD Great news from Axios this morning: our lead has increased to five points! Momentum and enthusiasm are firmly on our side thanks to your energy and support for this campaign. #VoteCramer #NDSen https://t.co/kw8g8SYgzC @VP has it exactly right. With his depth of experience and sterling reputation, there is no need for senators to play coy with Judge Kavanaugh.  #SCOTUSpick https://t.co/kisYBkWB3i Judge Kavanaugh is an excellent pick for ND and deserves our two votes for confirmation. #NDSen #SCOTUS https://t.co/vNTX95AxF9 Congratulations to Judge Brett Kavanaugh on your nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court! We’re all excited to see you on the bench. #NDSen #SCOTUS https://t.co/leZ3JgZEOl I’m proud to have co-sponsored bills throughout my tenure in the house that would secure our border and crack down on sanctuary cities. There’s only one candidate in this race that’s tough on illegal immigration and tough on border security. #VoteCramer #SecureOurBorder #NDSen https://t.co/Y3gocueHWs North Dakota is ready for a change. #VoteCramer #NDPol #NDSen https://t.co/mNYBIF2Sr6
