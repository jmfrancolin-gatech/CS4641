His departure from government is a significant loss for our country at a time where professional, steady leadership in national security is sorely needed. https://t.co/y58txz7Bz3 Instead of creating chaos, President Trump should support the bipartisan funding bill that the U.S. Senate passed unanimously.

We must continue working to promote fairness, dignity, accountability and rehabilitation in our criminal and juvenile justice systems. The bill also encourages states to limit the detention of youth status offenders who've committed an offense that would not be criminal if committed by an adult, like truancy, breaking curfew or running away from home. There's no reason for these kids to be incarcerated. Youth Promise Grants will help local communities disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline and support at-risk youth through a variety of programs, like tutoring, youth mentoring and physical and mental health programs. In addition, last week, Congress passed the Juvenile Justice Reform Act to reauthorize our federal JJ programs. This bill included two policies I've led in the Senate: Youth Promise Grants and limiting the detention of youth status offenders. It also includes reforms for federal prisons, encouraging participation in programming like job training, education and substance use rehabilitation. It prevents the use of restraints on pregnant inmates and ensures access to feminine hygiene products. The bill also effectively ends solitary confinement of juveniles in federal custody, a provision included in the MERCY Act. Kids aren't just little adults, and solitary confinement can be especially harmful to their developing minds. First Step eases mandatory minimum sentences and includes retroactivity for the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. This means individuals sentenced before 2010 can petition to have their sentences reexamined. Last night, we passed the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that makes important reforms to our federal criminal justice system, a jumping-off point as we work to address our Nation's mass incarceration problem. This year the Senate has passed two major bills to reform and improve our criminal justice and juvenile justice systems. I'm proud to have worked with colleagues across the political spectrum to get these bills done, and I look forward to continuing our work in the next Congress.

As President, he promoted democracy in the former Soviet Union and worked to expand the rights of individuals with disabilities. My prayers are with him and the Bush family at this time. Today, our nation mourns the loss of President George H.W. Bush and reflects on his lifetime of service. From his time in uniform to his days in Congress and ultimately in the White House, President Bush served our country honorably and with distinction for over 40 years. An agreement isn‚Äôt worth the paper it‚Äôs written on if it can‚Äôt be enforced, and right now the ability to enforce this ‚Äúnew‚Äù agreement is severely lacking. I will continue to push for the best deal for our Commonwealth and look forward to working with my colleagues to that end. My goal is and always has been a trade agreement that stops outsourcing and benefits Pennsylvania workers and Pennsylvania jobs. Pennsylvanians deserve and were promised a deal that levels the playing field. We‚Äôre not there yet. https://t.co/i3CIOjbpjM RT @PrestonSteve933: Only 3 more hours to bring those donations down! #CampOutForHunger https://t.co/iEgYTVUTbg RT @Philabundance: Humbled to have @SenBobCasey at #CampOutForHunger ‚Äúthis is a remarkable event.
