https://t.co/5wAyKAwOZL The American people are holding @realDonaldTrump responsible for the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/PoUq4mEygs America‚Äôs hard-working federal employees do the people‚Äôs work. They deserve to be able to pay their mortgage, rent, and put food on the table. It‚Äôs time to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/LZQfcZx7YU A shutdown beyond January would cause the Food and Nutrition Service to reduce benefits by about 40 percent to almost 40 million individuals and families across the country who are dependent on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/5zgmms8umY There are 7,471 federal workers and their families who are affected by the reckless and unnecessary #TrumpShutdown.

Last night, my House colleagues and I voted to reopen the government ‚Äî passing a plan Senate Republicans passed just weeks ago.

It‚Äôs time for @realDonaldTrump to come to his senses and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/jv7AhU9MpL I am proud to see that hard work and  leadership continues to pay off for the 1st Congressional District of Illinois. This ambitious and innovative endeavor was made possible in part by federal dollars, which continue to play a significant role in modernizing the South Side. https://t.co/TCpsOqtt9G .@realDonaldTrump should send that letter to Mexico because that's who he said would pay for the wall.

And why is it so hard for him to accept Americans don‚Äôt support his border wall? It‚Äôs time to end the #TrumpShutdown and let Americans get on with their lives. #NoBorderWall https://t.co/R39uNrQJlF Today, I voted to swiftly reopen government.
