Cc: @ClyburnSC06 @WGCV620AM https://t.co/LRGKhy1Ioc It’s time for us to work in a bipartisan way to move our country forward. We need to grow jobs, and build roads, bridges, and sewage. (2/2) We have to work together on ACA solutions, reforming thetax code, and improving our understructure. (1/2) The leaders of the House must step up because Congress needs to step in and demonstrate that we are working on behalf of the people. We’ve recently seen that there is a total disaster in the executive branch. (1/2) I applaud the CEO’s who steped up to fill the morality and credibility gap in our country. The other two branches need to work even harder when this sort of failure takes place.(2/2) When you have a moral crisis in the White House, Congress has to step into the gap to bring this country together. Trump has marginalized himself. He will never be able to provide the moral leadership that is needed in order to move an agenda forward. In no way should expressions of hatred and pure ignorance be excused, or justified. (1/2) Specially coming from POTUS, who apparently deems this behavior as acceptable. (2/2) Americans deserve a President who speaks out against bigotry and hatred. Trumps reactions during this time speaks volumes. In times like this it’s important to remember from where we’ve come, and that, equality, diversity and respect is what makes this country. HBCU's around the country are relying on the additional funding they need to continue the legacy of providing a quality education. My colleagues and I remain concerned about the inaction we are seeing toward addressing HBCU initiatives. We must address the issue of necessary funding needs to sustain HBCU's. My proposed background check legislation will prohibit licensed dealers from transferring firearms to buyers before check is completed. The Background Check Completion Act addresses the issue that resulted in the 2015 shooting at Emanuel AME Church. (1/2) We have seen what awful affects a lack of completed background checks can cause. There has to be a line drawn. This Act will guarantee that no gun is sold by a licensed dealer until a background check is completed. (2/2) You can read my letter about how pro coal federal policy helped kill the SC nuclear plants here: https://t.co/QX4HJTUpb7 The suspension of VC Summer will result in the loss of thousands of jobs and millions in anticipated tax revenue. New nuclear facilities are what we need to meet our environmental goals and economic needs in South Carolina. We must regulate carbon emissions and correctly assess how we can benefit from the uses of nuclear and clean-energy- sources.

I'm happy to represent hard working local people here in SC. https://t.co/5eah4UBuy5 Quality HC &amp; facilities should be accessible to all South Carolinians. I'm pleased to see a new medical ctr. being added to Bamberg county. SC recently lost several rural hospitals. The new Bamberg/ Barnwell ER will provide those areas w/ more access to health care opportunities. My hope is that this facility will help address the need for more rural health care facilities in SC, and the need for Medicaid expansion. Pleased to be a part of the ground breaking ceremony for this freestanding ER coming to Bamberg and Barnwell counties. https://t.co/Q2DXRPOgHA As we celebrate the #VRA Anniversary, let's remember our tenacious fights must continue. #RestoreTheVRA Just as we did 52 years ago, let's keep striving for fair and equitable voting practices. Yesterday marked 52 years since the Voting Rights Act was enacted. We must stay vigilant and keep working to protect its value. Minimally adequate education should be accorded to ALL in SC. Read my opinion piece on the issue, here: https://t.co/IyBvud7hjU Although the @SenateGOP's HC plan is dormant, it's not dead. We must not grow tired of working to #ProtectOurCare.

Roughly 37,000  health care jobs in rural communities will be lost if the @SenateGOP passes their plan. #Trumpcare could leave thousands of hard working Americans in rural communities without jobs. Great to see SC HS teachers advocating for Civil Rights education. It's important that our students know SC's history and relevance. Congratulations to the South Carolina Civil Rights Teachers Institute inaugural class. I look forward to observing the program's progress. Thank you to the South Carolina Civil Rights Teachers Institute for including me in their discussion of SC's Civil Rights history. https://t.co/EmhTi7Dq4V The continuation of this program means these unique institutions will have federal help maintaining their historical significance.

Everyone can benefit from Medicaid, this is for every family and every community. This is not just for lower income families. Recently, I held a town hall &amp; discussed the importance of our values &amp; affordable/accesible health care. Watch here:https://t.co/T3S9hG3KFj We need to protect the values of the ACA, &amp; what it has done for millions of Americans seeking adequate/quality health care. #ProtectOurCare The Community Health Ctr. bill will increase funding from $5.1B to $12.5B allowing these vital ctr.'s to serve twice as many people in 2028. Community Health Centers play an important role in our health care system. They serve communities that few other providers serve. Vital funds for CHCs expire in Sep. We must address the need to expand the funding to provide 100% coverage of Community Health Centers. While funding for Community Health Ctr.'s in the ACA was sched. to expire after 2015, we were able to successfully secure a 2 yr. extension. Yesterday @BernieSanders and I announced new legislation to increase funding for Community Health Centers. https://t.co/dMNpwlx2i4 RT @HouseDemocrats: #Trumpcare will kick 22 million off their health coverage – all in the name of another tax cut for the rich. https://t.… RT @KamalaHarris: Here’s the thing: Healthy people can become sick people in the blink of an eye.

Does the @SenateGOP not care about families? #Trumpcare is cruel to children, and mean to the elderly. Have they, @SenateGOP, no shame? The @SenateGOP’s #helathcarebill is #Trumpcare 2.0. It is feckless and reckless, cruel and mean. The @SenateGOP #healthcarebill will leave millions of Americans without care, robs the Medicare Trust Fund, &amp; reduces taxes for the wealthy. I’m proud of the work &amp; effort @Archie4Congress put into changing #SC05. The fight is not over. Despite the outcome we won’t grow weary. Much work needs to be done in SC.
