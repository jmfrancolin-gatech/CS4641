https://t.co/656r8Xi6l9 RT @STXPix: Congratulations to the area students who recently received appointments to the academies from @RepMarkWalker 
@eah_eagles @We_A… Area students among service academy nominations #NC06 https://t.co/Ed66mVYCTS @JayBilas @bdolinsky We can no longer look the other way at such injustice. Fine tuning plans for 2019 and may need your help @JayBilas. Both my greatest reward and accomplishment is the joy of sharing life with you. I continue to admire and learn from your love for the poor, the broken, and those deemed insignificant by today’s society. Happy Anniversary - 26 on the 26th! https://t.co/hQlA8Gqhnx Proud of my brother-in-law, first responders and our servicemen and women standing guard and serving this Christmas Day! https://t.co/U4AH8ilIVG Thank you @jdgreear for the opportunity to attend @SummitRDU Christmas at @DPAC. Five sellout performances honoring Jesus, the Savior of the Season! https://t.co/LMq5UNWDv6 For unto us a Child is born. Unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His name shall be called Jesus.

Kelly, Anna Claire &amp; I wish you a Merry Christmas! https://t.co/OwBQegUrhl Much better news than all the shutdown talk! https://t.co/B8w45AemZW RT @RussVought45: .@SenWarren, this is inaccurate. Federal employees will receive their next paycheck, even under a lapse. Let’s come toget… Spoke with @VP Pence today. He and COS Mulvaney made a fair offer this afternoon in good faith to Sen. Schumer and team that would provide funding to protect all Americans. 1.6 billion is too low and cannot be restricted meaning no barrier, wall or fencing. Let’s get it done! @POTUS This is a great start, but in the next Congress, I will be working to ensure more accountability for former members who continue to profit off their time in Congress, despite leaving due to such actions. @POTUS From now on, members of Congress will be held accountable for their misbehavior, just like every other American. The existence of a secret hush fund that uses taxpayer money to settle sexual misconduct from members of Congress highlights exactly why people don’t trust Washington. That’s why we are ending it. Thank you @POTUS for signing this into law. https://t.co/2maQvWr17C Mark Twain said, “The two most important days in your life is the day you were born and the day you find out why.” For many people who’ve never had that opportunity, the First Step Act provides a chance to discover their why. https://t.co/HsHLWk5lZN Santa says he’s good with me staying in DC! https://t.co/5BMFQXutX0 Wishing for Justice Ginsburg to make a full recovery. Hopeful she can leave the hospital soon and spend time with her family this Christmas season. The House just passed my GAO-IG Act, sending it to the @POTUS' desk. This legislation will improve government, while bringing needed accountability to federal agencies and saving hardworking Americans as much as $87 billion. https://t.co/y2ce5AE6ka @SenToddYoung @POTUS The GAO-IG Act will improve government, while bringing needed accountability and saving hardworking Americans as much as $87 billion.
