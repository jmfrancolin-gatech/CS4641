We can expand manufacturing to create good-paying jobs while also tackling the climate crisis. The fastest growing industries in America today are solar and wind.

We need to invest in renewables, microgrids, electric vehicles, retrofits and energy efficiency in every community. I agree with @Alyssa_Milano https://t.co/gZb6a7EXJo The wealthiest 1 percent in America own more wealth today than at any time over the past 50 years. We have to expand the estate tax while also making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. https://t.co/J0OSBKYKR9 If we imposed a tiny tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other investments, it could raise $110 billion to $403 billion according to @EconomicPolicy.

This financial transaction tax could also limit the risky investments that caused the financial crisis. Shirley Chisholm was a trailblazer:

We need to limit stock buybacks so corporations invest in their workers and the communities they operate in. https://t.co/ET9t2vdPYX Many of the Republicans who want to eliminate the estate tax that only applies to families with more than $22 million in assets balk in horror when we discuss expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and giving a well-earned raise to working Americans making under $75,000/year.

The Green New Deal is an aspirational vision to take action on climate while creating millions of jobs. Trump said NAFTA 2.0 is the “most important trade deal we have ever made.” I guess he’s talking about Big Pharma.

Honest question Trump’s deepest lie to our nation is that his policies on immigration and trade will bring prosperity to places left behind in a fast changing economy. The answers are far more complex, and it's insulting to Americans in the heartland who know better to pretend otherwise. The irony of Trump’s speech is he implored that “this is the time to reignite the American imagination” but offered a stale message. He did not talk about new technology or new industry or new entrepreneurs. He simply wanted to wall in the past. That’s not how America was built. It’s great that technology has allowed work to be distributed, but people should still be able to unplug when they are feeling sick.

I wish everyone a prosperous and successful year ahead. #YearOfThePig The pharmaceutical industry should be focused on making sure that prescription drugs are accessible and can provide the largest benefit for the most people.

When the goal is excessive profits, people have to ration or skip prescriptions because they can’t afford the cost. Republicans keep pushing tax breaks for billionaires and corporations but what about the middle and working class Americans who make this country successful?

We need to expand the EITC to make up for decades of wage stagnation. https://t.co/XkeTWmfAN9 We urgently need to lower the cost of prescription drugs, but ending these rebates isn’t enough.

Would it be okay for Democrats to shutdown the government to force through Medicare for All? Los Angeles teachers went on strike for six days and won a 6 percent pay raise, caps on class sizes, and more funding for nurses, counselors, and psychologists.

This is what union power looks like. #Red4Ed #1u https://t.co/cqKiQUhk78 @501colin @peterawolf @IlhanMN RT in replying to a question is part of dialogue!

That’s why we protested today in the Hart Building.

End this shutdown now, @SenateMajLdr. #OccupyHart I was proud to stand with federal workers, @AFGENational president @JDavidCoxSr and @Jamie_Raskin for a 33 minute silent protest to reopen government and pay employees for the work they are doing. #OccupyHart https://t.co/tWibKZlNpy While Trump continues shutting down our government over his campaign promise, and McConnell lacks the courage to treat the Senate as a separate branch of government, economic growth is being lost every week. https://t.co/78GuIYN2eS RT @downwithtyranny: .@RoKhanna on CCS: "The irony of having privileged kids yell 'build a wall' to a Native American-- the 1st inhabitants… So...Pelosi announces strong progressives on the committee who believe it is our constitutional obligation to have transparency and hold the Administration accountable, and the day after Cohen decides he won’t testify.

This has gone on for long enough. That’s why I’m joining federal workers today to demand an end to this shutdown. #OccupyHart https://t.co/0u7xGYINRB Let me get this straight. The US is sanctioning Venezuela for their lack of democracy but not Saudi Arabia? Such hypocrisy.

There’s no military solution to such a diffuse insurgency. We need to work with intelligence networks and cooperate with regional players to tackle the remaining insurgency. The idea that the transgender military ban is “necessary to place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people.” is completely false and without merit.

The Trump administration is engaging in transgender discrimination, plain and simple. Republican pundits try to claim that America is divided on abortion rights but the truth is that most Americans are in support. 

On the 46th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, we must stand together and defend a woman’s right to control her own body. #Roe46 https://t.co/uT8PURf1Po One reason I’m proud to rep the Bay Area is that so many of us have been ahead of the curve on LGBTQ equality. Most of us supported same sex marriage back in 2004 (even though they didn’t let @GavinNewsom speak at the DNC). Ensuring equality was a no brainer. https://t.co/PnnhNs3Bdd This is what gender bias looks like. Regardless of who you support, the fact is that there would never be a headline saying “Three hard-left men is a recipe for Democratic disaster in 2020.” https://t.co/GIduNA3T5a It’s shameful that the Supreme Court has temporarily given the green light to the transgender military ban.

Transgender servicemembers risk their lives everyday serving our country and they deserve better than this.

Trump has shut down government for a campaign pledge. Democrats want government open and then will negotiate. Constitutionally, Dems are right; Trump is wrong.
