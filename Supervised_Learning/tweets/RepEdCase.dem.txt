I look forward to serving on the House Natural Resources committee, in whose decisions are so critical to our State.
https://t.co/gFuxJh06Zh I am relieved that this shutdown is temporarily suspended. I am committed to a full debate and decision making on securing our borders, but it remains to be seen if the lesson has been learned that government should never be shut down over policy disputes. https://t.co/FAxMOWZ5HI Today marks the 9 year anniversary of Citizens United v. FEC  Supreme  Court ruling, which allowed special interest groups and their Super PACs to heavily influence elections. That's why I co-sponsored  H.R.1:  For The People Act to repeal Citizens United. https://t.co/MIs4wvv1Bl Honored to march today alongside so much diversity in celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. https://t.co/gVputzJ3GT Working on homelessness: At a training session by the Institute for Human Services in Waikiki to volunteer for the 2019 Honolulu point-in-time count of homeless this week. https://t.co/TrYwj4DonA Meeting with the press in front of the Capitol with my fellow freshman Members of Congress to urge the Senate and President to end this needless shutdown. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/YQVTpeSBJv Stood with @RepJudyChu Chair of @CAPAC, new member colleague Ilhan Omar, Pro-Choice Caucus, Planned Parenthood, and @NAPAWF in opposition to recent attacks on women’s health.

Since Statehood, only one Hawaii Representative has ever served on this committee, and that was Senator Akaka 29 years ago. https://t.co/kzA7tOHZS2 Due to the #GovernmentShutDown, key visitor attractions like our national parks and Pearl Harbor historical sites are shut down. We are doing everything we can to help our federal employees, contractors,  local businesses, and organizations cope with the impacts of the shutdown. https://t.co/2VESCuWYUJ The thousands of Hawaii federal workers and their families should not be held hostage over Trump’s wall. #GovernmentShutDown
