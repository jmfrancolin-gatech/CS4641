https://t.co/yH2MIilhhS https://t.co/84Xj6QRyHM This is why my work is not over, but just beginning. My life‚Äôs work will only end when American families have the basic security of safety. 

Until then, I will always be a mother on a mission. 

[4/4] https://t.co/h8lS24QvEZ On the day after I lost my son to gun violence, 96 families learned what I did the day before - they, too, lost a loved one to gun violence.

And since my son‚Äôs murder, almost 220,000 families have lost a loved one to gun violence.

[3/4] I know that I have been called to fight for change. 

Because on the very same day I lost my son, there were 95 OTHER families in this country learning they, too, lost a loved one to gun violence. 

[2/4] My son was murdered exactly six years ago to date. Every year, I am reminded that the title ‚Äúreluctant activist‚Äù is painfully accurate. 

This year, today comes just two months before I will fight for my son‚Äôs legacy in Congress - but it does not make the pain any less. 

[1/4] https://t.co/wtHCJ6mDMZ We have so much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

I am thankful for all of my neighbors in #GA06, and I hope that everyone can spend today with family and loved ones. https://t.co/sjBfTzSRkD The most rewarding part of my job is talking to people I meet every single day. #GA06 just wants a government that works - and that is what I intend to do. https://t.co/VJ0G3hnppx Never thought I would be here. This is for you, Jordan. And for every single family impacted by gun violence in this country - let‚Äôs get to work. #GA06 https://t.co/2lwgmrL0vI .@staceyabrams ran an inspirational campaign and highlighted how absolutely critical it is to count every single vote. #gapol Being a mother on a mission is what drove me to run for office. 

Now I will be the voice for #GA06 - I will speak up for stronger and safer communities in my district and around the country.

I pledge to fight as hard as I can for every single family in this country. 

[4/4] I grieve with the families affected and for the lives lost. I am thankful for all the first responders. Finally, I pray that Congress will support me in taking action to prevent these tragedies. 

[3/4] As a congresswoman, but more importantly as a mother, I pledge to do everything I can to make our communities safer. The most important title I am ever going to have is Jordan‚Äôs mom.

[2/4] STATEMENT ON #ThousandOaks SHOOTING. 

It is unfortunately not surprising that on the same day I officially became a Congresswoman-Elect, other families in this country are receiving the same exact call that I did six years ago when I learned my son had been murdered.

[1/4] This win is just the beginning. We‚Äôve sent a strong message to the entire country. Absolutely nothing - no politician &amp; no special interest - is more powerful than a mother on a mission.

Lives are at stake - let‚Äôs win these seats.
VOLUNTEER ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/KAputCkt4m The truth is, if we had common sense gun laws, our families would very likely not be grieving.

The only reason laws supported by over 90% of Americans have not been enacted, is because politicians like @KarenHandel are bought and paid for by the NRA gun lobby. My campaign is about standing up, and fixing the broken system that wronged each of us.

This is what drives me, a grieving Marietta mom, to stand up against a career politician like @KarenHandel who places the profits of the NRA gun lobby over our families. .@fred_guttenberg, Patricia, and I are part of a club nobody wants to belong to - we have all lost family members to gun violence. 
We deeply wish that we did not have to stand up today in these circumstances, but we have no other option https://t.co/OgRVhEBsUc We have a week left in this race - and my opponent knows that in 7 days, voters I have been talking to every single day will vote for affordable healthcare, common sense gun laws, and responsible leadership. #GA06

She has taken thousands of dollars from the NRA, and failed to enact common sense measures that are supported by over 90% of Americans. #APCDebates RT @RenittaShannon: Watching this debate it‚Äôs clear. @karenhandel Bad for families. Bad for Women. Bad for Georgia. @atlpressclub @LucyWins‚Ä¶ .@KarenHandel lies and lies and lies on immigration - because she wants to hide the truth from voters. 

We must stand up for the truth - and vote out the incompetent legislators responsible for the faults of our immigration system. #APCDebates I watched @KarenHandel gavel down the cries of children separated from their parents. I know first hand how horrific it is to have a child ripped apart from you.

@karenhandel did not want the American public to know the horrific impact of her policies. #APCDebates https://t.co/5qmvH8i7kV Our supporters are lined up outside the studio cheering on Lucy right before the big debate!

I promise to every single person in the LGBTQ+ community, young and old - I see you. I hear you. And I will fight for you. 

(4/5) https://t.co/eq63otaLcU When @KarenHandel was approached by a concerned parent of an LGBTQ+ teenager, Handel refused to even listen. 

She was dismissive and showed no concern for our LGBTQ+ children.

There are several million LGBTQ+ individuals in the United States.

The LGBTQ+ community still fights for equal treatment. Over 40% of LGBTQ+ youth do not feel accepted in their communities.

(2/5) https://t.co/JQgzWeyWPN Last weekend, I celebrated the progress that LGBTQ+ Americans have made in this country at #pride.

However, at the Pride Parade there was a notable absence. My opponent in this race - @KarenHandel was nowhere to be seen.

THREAD (1/5) https://t.co/WRVq13J3bS I am not a politician. 

But I have lived the issues that matter most to people in #GA06 - and I know the changes that we must make. 

https://t.co/eLiaUd7QYH Social security is a promise that we made to the American people, and it is a promise we must keep. 

My opponent voted against Social Security this week. 

Stand Up ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/GOT4hTpLFO https://t.co/KcolnnA31i A woman's right to choose should be protected. My opponent is too extreme for Georgia. #gapol #GA06 

https://t.co/zG29A2y5Yz The most fundamental thing you can do as an American is to vote.
Vote for change. 
Vote for progress.
