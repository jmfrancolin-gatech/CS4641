There is another artificial crisis created by one man – President Trump. We have bipartisan bills before us that could reopen the government. It’s time for Republicans &amp; Democrats to join together to tell the President to put a stop to these self-inflicted wounds. #TrumpShutdown There is a crisis. It's the crisis at the kitchen table as families struggle to make ends meet. A crisis of morale for the dedicated people who serve our country, a crisis of confidence in the young people doubting a career in public service. &amp; the President simply walks away. The great irony of the #TrumpShutdown is that it’s making our borders less safe. 88 percent of the DHSecurity, including 54,000 at CBP, 51,000 at TSA and 42,000 at Coast Guard are working without pay. IF this WAS about border security, they would be getting PAID. Another #VT'er wrote: “To be sure, we do not believe that capitulation to the Republican demand for the Wall is the answer; yet the toll on the people of holding the government hostage to such outrageous demands must not be ignored.” I agree. #TrumpShutdown One #VT'er wrote: "I’m writing you to suggest that this kind of government shutdown shouldn't be on the negotiation table, bc it holds out the possibility that the suffering of the American people can be used as political leverage. There are other ways.” I agree.  #TrumpShutdown VT’ers -- like a veteran whose employees cannot pay their bills. A man worried about his 88-year-old aunt.

It is a crisis he’s caused, felt right now at the kitchen tables of American families who are trying to figure out how they will make ends meet and pay their bills. #TrumpShutdown Long before the #TrumpShutdown began, Donald Trump, as a candidate, and then as President, resorted to fear, cynicism and misinformation for personal and political gain.

To President Trump’s Primetime Address https://t.co/99wrzAQnEC https://t.co/bxkIjSYaYc The President may not care about the impact his shutdown is having on millions of Americans, but the Senate must.  Stoking fear through misinformation in order to promote his political agenda is simply wrong.  #TrumpShutdown Everyone agrees that we need to secure our borders, but there are smart ways to do it, and a wall is not one of them.  It is a 5th Century solution to a 21st Century problem.  #TrumpShutdown Just yesterday, a #VT’er called my office worried he would not be able to pay his bills past mid January because of the #TrumpShutdown.  He was upset, worried, and looking for help.  Does the President even care? For more than two weeks now, the President has held the paychecks of over 800,000 Americans hostage in order to extort Congress into funding his border wall — a wall for which he promised the American taxpayers, over and over again, that Mexico would pay. It’s looking like “No Collusion!” may be right up there with “Mexico will pay for it!” https://t.co/wtPTs7q0iH President Trump needs a reality check.
