The National Archives &amp; Records Administration is closed due to the shutdown. My caseworkers use NARA every day to get records for veterans filing a claim w/ VA. These claims are time-sensitive. Each day that this shutdown continues is another day that those vets go without care. This funding helped bring #NY04 back after Sandy, and it's critical to Puerto Rico's ongoing recovery. It saves lives and protects communities from future storms. 

Wasting it on a useless wall is downright dumb and reckless.

Not going to happen. 
https://t.co/0kQybXvcXf Just voted on another series of bipartisan funding bills to reopen the government. Right now 800,000 federal workers are going without a paycheck including tens of thousands of veterans. That's disgraceful.

Thank you @NYGovCuomo for extending this vital program. https://t.co/UmgtxoBeWb If President Trump and @HouseGOP actually cared about our security, they would stop obsessing over a useless border wall, they would vote to reopen the government and they would pay the hardworking men and women who keep us safe. The next Congress will do better. This week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers won’t receive a paycheck. That includes TSA, CBP, FBI &amp; DEA agents, and members of the Coast Guard - the very people who are charged with protecting our homeland. To all of them, thank you for continuing to protect and serve. There's been no accountability for the administration's reckless border policy. And the consequences have been tragic.

Shameful. https://t.co/NFkxDoq4sv Congress has a basic responsibility to fund the government and the President and House Republicans completely dropped the ball, all at the expense of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. The American people deserve better. This #shutdown is brought to you by @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP. Instead of passing the Senate's funding bill, they decided to hold this country hostage. They voted on a pointless messaging bill to fund a useless border wall – a bill that they knew would go nowhere. Hey #NY04! Our office in Washington DC has moved!

The American people spoke loud &amp; clear and Congress must answer the call. We need to pass commonsense gun violence legislation once and for all. Sadly, our fight to end gun violence is far from over. 2018 was a tragic reminder of that. 

But this year also showed us that the American people want change. They elected a Democratic majority that vowed to finally take meaningful action to end our gun violence epidemic. After Carolyn's family was torn apart by gun violence, she turned her grief into action. She ran for Congress and won. And she tackled this issue head-on. I'm forever grateful for her bravery and her leadership, and I'm honored to follow in her footsteps in #NY04.

Join us at the Garden City Public Library on Oct. 25th @ 11AM. We'll have a drug reclamation, NARCAN training, on-site addiction specialists &amp; more. 

Sign up for the training here: https://t.co/gGJRKSp1pN https://t.co/7r1k9VTipU This report confirms what we already knew:
1. DHS was completely unprepared to implement Trump's disastrous zero-tolerance policy
2. The admin misled the American people about family separations
3. The ensuing humanitarian crisis was fueled by sheer incompetence &amp; indifference https://t.co/UXfWQUn6pv Congratulations to South Side High school and W. Tresper Clarke High School on being named 2018 National Blue Ribbon schools! #NY04 @RVCSchools @WestburySchools The first tax bill capped state &amp; local tax deductions &amp; hurt hard-working families in #NY04. The new tax package makes that cap permanent.

This isn't a "2.0" bill - it's just more of the same bad policy &amp; it won't even get a vote in the Senate.  

Yet another @HouseGOP PR stunt In awe of Dr. Ford's poise and courage. By coming forward and testifying today, she is standing up for survivors everywhere. We owe her a debt of gratitude. My statement on H.Res.1071. https://t.co/OlS8igWt28 Enough is enough. @SpeakerRyan, it’s time to vote on legislation to protect Robert Mueller and his investigation. This is not about politics, it's about preserving our rule of law. https://t.co/0HHUkiiWqn I met with our #Veterans Advisory Committee yesterday to discuss the ongoing efforts to improve access to health care services for Long Island's vets. https://t.co/ekLgSzhHSE Proud to introduce the Students and Families Empowerment Act today @AdelphiU. Too many college graduates are living with crippling student loan debt. Our government can &amp; should do more to help. 

My bill offers important, common-sense solutions: https://t.co/jEXKadaDYq https://t.co/ozHVRwJQ0O The majority of sexual assaults are never reported to the police.

This is a disgusting and ignorant take - but not at all surprising coming from an admitted sexual predator. https://t.co/cAMGfBLUsQ Had a great roundtable discussion today with local labor leaders from across Long Island, where we covered important topics including the recent #Janus decision. Strong unions mean a strong middle class and I'm going to keep up the fight for working families. https://t.co/Mw0auQc5Y3 Wishing all those observing #YomKippur in #NY04 an easy and meaningful fast. G’Mar Chatima Tova! Could not agree more. Long Island's veterans deserve nothing less than the best possible care - and that starts with prioritizing investments in the @NorthportVAMC. 

Thank you to @SenSchumer for his tireless advocacy on this issue. https://t.co/JzUIujassT Today I testified before the House Rules Committee on my resolution to prohibit Members of Congress from serving on the boards of publicly-held companies. 

Hard to believe this rule doesn't already exist. This is just common sense and long overdue. https://t.co/5DtYmoMZvZ RT @WhipHoyer: One immediate change we can make to strengthen ethics standards in Congress is to ban House Members from serving on corporat… Today we remember those who lost their lives on 9/11, we pray for their families, and we reaffirm our never-ending commitment to the heroic first responders who answered the call that day and in the days following.  #NeverForget Wishing a happy &amp; healthy new year to everyone celebrating #RoshHashanah in #NY04 &amp; around the world. L'Shanah Tovah! It's been 1 year since Trump terminated #DACA. Since then, @SpeakerRyan hasn't taken any action to protect Dreamers. Instead, he introduced 2 right-wing immigration bills that failed.

We could resolve this today if @HouseGOP had the courage to bring up a bipartisan solution. Once again, Republicans are trying to eliminate protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. They want to restore a system where providers can discriminate &amp; deny care to those who need it most. Make no mistake, this is an attack on working families. #ProtectOurCare Happy #LaborDay! Today we celebrate the contributions of all American workers, past and present. Tomorrow we keep up the fight for workers' rights and equality in the workplace. President Trump wants people to think that Michael Cohen didn't actually commit a crime. That would be pretty convenient for him. 

But he's flat-out wrong and his claims are a direct attack on our rule of law.

@RepTedLieu &amp; I set the record straight: https://t.co/tKRxr3iGAY These grants represent critical investments in our communities and schools. I'm grateful to Governor Cuomo for recognizing the continued need for these programs, which are crucial to fighting gang violence and recruitment on Long Island. https://t.co/ah1Ok3LStw Pleased to announce more than $1 million in security grant funding for eight nonprofit organizations in #NY04. I'll continue working to ensure all of our communities have the resources and support they need to keep people safe. https://t.co/jklDx5tHjB Deeply saddened to hear of John McCain’s passing. This is truly a national tragedy. Senator McCain served, he sacrificed and he persisted. His voice was and should continue to be a moral compass for our country. I’m praying for his family tonight. May he rest in peace. Senator McCain is a true patriot and public servant. His strength, independence and unwavering sense of duty should inspire us all. I'm praying for him and the entire McCain family. I was a prosecutor for 20+ years. Cooperating witnesses play a crucial role in exposing the truth and bringing criminals to justice - often at great personal risk. And those who try to denigrate and silence them often have something to hide. https://t.co/rBXIgWyLDX Teachers are asking for raises, new books &amp; more money for school supplies. 

Besty DeVos wants to buy them guns. 

Her plan would divert crucial education funds away from kids &amp; into the hands of the #NRA. It's absurd &amp; will only put more lives at risk. Congress will fight this. https://t.co/ipyVwU5Tdw Today @RepTomReed &amp; I introduced our bill to prohibit Members of the House from serving on corporate boards. If we want to maintain the public's trust then we need to close gaping loopholes like this one. This is a common-sense bill &amp; it's long overdue. https://t.co/n4UgM4WNx0 Such a pleasure spending time with Pablo Villavicencio, his wife Sandra &amp; their two beautiful daughters. This family has been through a lot and it was wonderful seeing them together again. I'm proud that they call #NY04 home. Thank you to @LegalAidNYC for their work on this case! https://t.co/HGrXIiVg8d Revoking Brennan's security clearance is pettiness at the expense of national security. We always knew @realDonaldTrump had a fragile ego, but this shows just how far he’s willing to go to silence critics &amp; trample the 1st amendment. His priorities get more misguided by the day. Today I met with the Sokolow family to discuss the Anti-terrorism Clarification Act, which recently passed in the House. This bill would finally allow victims of terrorism to seek justice. I urge the Senate to take up this legislation so we can send it to the President's desk. https://t.co/3oUxm3YsLq Had great visit with the Hempstead @HomeDepot team this morning. Home Depot employs 1,115 people at 4 stores across #NY04. I had a chance to tour the store, talk with staff and learn more about the company. Looking forward to visiting again soon! https://t.co/73Cdfw7YHL The indictment against Rep. Collins has made clear the need for reform. Today, @RepTomReed &amp; I announced a resolution to prohibit U.S. Reps from serving on the boards of publicly-held companies. This change is long overdue. https://t.co/HjATTj0OqG This is one of the most despicable examples of the cronyism that’s come to define this administration. 

Our veterans deserve far better than Trump's three unqualified golf buddies. 

I'm calling on Chairman Roe to quickly hold a hearing on this issue.

https://t.co/T1yNYyq4Qr It is clear that TSA needs to reassess its technological capabilities and improve its screening procedures to be more inclusive and ensure that no American is ever humiliated or discriminated against while going through security. https://t.co/pI2zzKPbt6 The transgender community deserves to be treated with fairness and respect in all aspects of life, including travel. Maintaining high safety standards and screening all passengers with dignity should not be mutually exclusive. #ScreeningwithDignityAct https://t.co/F80U9kcC6B A proud moment for Nassau County! This designation reminds us of the pivotal role that our community has played in American aviation &amp; military history. https://t.co/ZMfAPPIxcL Thank you Karen and Brandon! Your family's story and your tireless advocacy have played such an important role in getting us to this point! https://t.co/v0iEdyfzN4 Today I introduced the Younger-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Parity Act. Too often Americans w/ younger-onset Alzheimer’s are denied access to critical services because of their age. This bill would fix that. Thank you to all those who joined us this morning! https://t.co/aRnwkO3PGT https://t.co/l6tfc45rIJ A woman's right to choose should not be up for debate. We must #CommitToRoe &amp; oppose any efforts to restrict abortion rights. @NARAL One year ago @realDonaldTrump foolishly tweeted his unconstitutional ban on transgender service members. We must continue to reject this discrimination &amp; make it clear to trans troops that we are grateful for their service even if the commander-in-chief is not #ProtectTransTroops Great news! Pablo deserves to be home with his family. Thank you to @LegalAidNYC for their incredible work on behalf of the Villavicencios. The fight is not over but today is a good day. https://t.co/z6ZCE1rzAI American victims of terrorism like the Sokolow family deserve the opportunity to seek justice, regardless of where the attacks take place. The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act will allow them to do that. https://t.co/SjKbJhK6DN Earlier this year, @RepTedLieu and I called on the FBI to investigate these exact payments. We believe they may have violated campaign finance laws. Now it appears the President had direct knowledge. Our letter to the FBI Director: https://t.co/jwmLLWIwWA https://t.co/KYdVd9tKNM Few members of Congress have more credibility on this issue than my colleague @HurdOnTheHill. A smart piece that calls for bipartisan action to counter Russian aggression &amp; election interference. Couldn't agree more. https://t.co/KnBLpFyqcy Today @RepStefanik &amp; I called on @POTUS to appoint an Election Security Czar. The threat of continued interference is urgent &amp; real. We need to make sure our federal agencies are working together &amp; sharing information. Our letter:  https://t.co/iNtXV1Zuey American citizens are not bargaining chips. The fact that @POTUS even entertained the idea of letting Russia interrogate @McFaul &amp; @Billbrowder is a total betrayal of our diplomatic corps &amp; values. If he had any loyalty or courage he would have swiftly rejected this request. In May, @RepTedLieu &amp; I sent a letter to the FBI calling for an investigation into Russian ties to the NRA. Yesterday, Russian national Mariia Butina was charged w/ acting as a foreign agent after attempting to infiltrate the NRA to influence our election. https://t.co/5zGxOzrk0F https://t.co/36MCrtvqya My statement on why we need an Election Security Czar: https://t.co/QtG2b2I97y This is not a thing of the past. Our intel community confirmed that Russia is actively trying to interfere in the 2018 election. Yet, @POTUS continues to believe Putin over our own experts. His actions today weren't just shameful, they were dangerous &amp; potentially treasonous. https://t.co/p8C9Mgp7MM Whether or not @POTUS addressed Russia's interference in our election during his meeting with Putin is irrelevant, because this is how he continues to frame the topic.

The President does not care that Russia attacked our democracy. And that's a total betrayal to our country. https://t.co/HMS6mBi5q2 WATCH: When asked if they agree w/ the intel community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election 2/4 @DHSgov officials had "no opinion." Officials who cannot acknowledge this fact are not equipped to protect our elections in 2018 &amp; 2020. 

https://t.co/zXXv7cY5iW Yesterday, @USRepKeating and I questioned senior DHS officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election &amp; they refused to state definitively that Russia was responsible. Today, DOJ indicted 12 Russian military &amp; intelligence officers for hacking. 
https://t.co/ohLSqeFVpb My amendment to the Intel Authorization Act passed yesterday. It'll require @ODNIgov &amp; @USTreasury to develop a threat assessment report on terrorist use of virtual currencies. We need to give law enforcement the resources they need to counter this threat. https://t.co/RYAG6tATkZ Proud to join 31 of my colleagues in requesting information from @TSA on its screening procedures for transgender passengers. https://t.co/TcH9el7ZPz Fine print: "12 adults have been deported and are being contacted."

I wonder how "complete" this process feels for those families. This is shameful. https://t.co/e7eznrdznh The entire intel community acknowledges that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. Yet President Trump's words &amp; actions give us no reason to believe he will hold Putin accountable in their upcoming meeting. His response so far has been a total joke. In a @HouseHomeland hearing on Election Security where DHS Under Secretary Krebs says there is a concerted effort by Russia to interfere in our 2018 elections. But instead of working w/ our partners in Europe to confront Russia, @POTUS insults our allies &amp; downplays this threat. Meanwhile, the Trump Admin failed to meet the deadline set by a federal judge to reunite all separated children under the age of 5 w/ their families. @SecNielsen has no business representing our nation abroad while, under her watch, thousands of families remain separated. https://t.co/lxeYudhxyx
