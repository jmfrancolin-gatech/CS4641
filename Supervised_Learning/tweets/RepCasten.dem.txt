Today I was proud to stand with veterans to provide convenient, safe, cost-free options for child care services when they have VA medical appointments. #ChildCare4Vets John Dingell served with integrity and class - his legacy will be remembered for generations to come. I am grateful for his service and hope one day to embody his leadership. RT @SenatorDurbin: My statement with @SenDuckworth, @RepBillFoster, @RepLipinski, @RepSchneider, and @RepCasten on the latest with Sterigen‚Ä¶ I look forward to working with my colleagues under the leadership of Chair Castor to address the existential challenge to our species." https://t.co/OlfgCCHHi7 Today I was named to serve on the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis: 

"Having spent the last 20 years profitably reducing greenhouse gas emissions, I can offer the Select Committee real world expertise and a life-long commitment to action on climate change. There are places where we can and must find common ground with this White House but we cannot, and I will not, endorse falsehoods.

https://t.co/uHWYvIWLMj I believe the American people deserve to hear the truth from their elected leaders and that it is the duty of Congress to serve as a check on the President. tangible measures to reduce the gun violence epidemic in this country; a commitment to women‚Äôs rights, including the right to choose and a push for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women‚Äôs Act. I would have liked to have heard: a call for united action on climate change that includes real solutions like reducing CO2 emissions; a plan to repair the damage done in the last two years to the Affordable Care Act to ensure affordable, accessible health care for all; I appreciate his rhetoric on reducing drug prices and his acknowledgement of strong female leadership in the house, but ultimately his remarks fell short of the kind of bipartisan unity that our nation needs. I would have liked to have seen statesmanship and an end to the divisive rhetoric that has been a hallmark of his candidacy and his time in office. The President fell short. He could have demonstrated a willingness to solve problems that we all agree need to be addressed. Read my statement on last night's #SOTU: 

I ran for office, not to play politics, but to work hard to find solutions to pressing problems. I think the American people deserve elected leaders who really do want to come together to address challenges we all agree exist. Heading to my first #SOTU with my guest Judie. https://t.co/wFyK1wINM9 Great to run into @RepUnderwood and her #SOTU guest Allie. @FamilyShelter https://t.co/ZDvLsvCgr0 lower healthcare costs and repair the damage done to Affordable Care Act; invest in American infrastructure and middle class jobs; and agree to working in a truly bipartisan fashion to enhance border security and avert another government shutdown. In addition to those subjects, I hope he will use this opportunity to address reducing the risk of climate change; push for common-sense gun safety legislation; We need solutions, and I hope the President will take the opportunity provided by tonight‚Äôs address to put politics aside, end his divisive rhetoric, and demonstrate statesmanship to tackle these critical matters. On the heels of the longest government shutdown in U.S.  history, our national security is strained, our economy is hampered and thousands of federal workers worse off, now more than ever. Read my statement on the upcoming #SOTU https://t.co/7CcWKSJkYA

Tonight‚Äôs address gives the President an opportunity to bring our nation together, as well as Democrats and Republicans together to solve issues and deliver results for the American people. In the first six months of this fiscal year, Family Shelter estimates it was unable to help nearly 1,000 people with shelter. https://t.co/PfYBP48PrG https://t.co/bx1eoaupym . @FamilyShelter Service was directly impacted by the 35-day government shutdown. Due to the long-running budgetary uncertainty, the organization left vacant counseling positions funded through federal dollars. #SOTU I am honored she will be my guest; she has helped to rebuild the lives of thousands of victims and is a champion in our own community. Her message will open more dialogue in Congress &amp; illustrate why we must work together to solve nationwide issues. https://t.co/ld9XlignW5 ICYMI: Tonight my guest to the #StateOfTheUnion will be Judie Caribeaux the Executive Director of @FamilyShelter Service in DuPage County. https://t.co/k15z4Pg8Tt Today we recommit to continue her legacy of standing against racism and discrimination and fighting for equality for all. #BlackHistoryMonth Today marks what would have been the 106th birthday of #RosaParks ‚Äì a brave champion in the civil rights movement. We remember and honor her courageous actions. Today I announced that my guest to the annual State of the Union address will be Judie Caribeaux, Executive Director of the Family Shelter Service in DuPage County.

Sign up for my e-newsletter by clicking here: https://t.co/OeqweEkHxT https://t.co/J0GXFuIl3m Since I took office just three weeks ago, I have voted 11 times with the House Majority to re-open the government and am committed to working with my colleagues to deliver a long-term funding bill. https://t.co/8AJh9NYYsR The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported the U.S lost $11 billion due to the #TrumpShutdown, including $3 billion that will never be recovered ‚Äì the cost of a false promise. https://t.co/fb1ImXIpHc On this #HolocaustRemembranceDay we remember the 6 million Jewish lives lost during one of the darkest moments in history. We remember them and what can happen when bigotry and hatred are not confronted. #NeverAgain Now it‚Äôs time to get to work to proudly serve the 6th District in the 116TH Congress. We must work together and serve the American people ‚Äì our democracy depends on it. I‚Äôm grateful Senator Durbin delivered the keynote address and for his leadership not only in the delegation but also throughout the country and I look forward to our continued partnership. It is easy - but wrong - to blame politics for our problems. It is hard - and right -  to acknowledge our inherent equality. Rather than inflame political divides, let us all work to to inspire our better angels. I promise to do so and ask you to do the same. Their voices were heard and I will fight to pass laws that reduce the risk of climate change, to protect healthcare, and to push for common-sense gun safety legislation. The immense amount of gratitude I have representing the 6th district is indescribable and I will work every day to deliver results for my constituents. Today was a special day for me as I was sworn in to the 116th Congress in my home district ‚Äì surrounded by my friends, family, and the people I have the honor to represent. https://t.co/4CXckjXWiB RT @SenatorDurbin: There are many outstanding questions remaining about monitoring for EtO emissions from facilities in Lake &amp; DuPage Count‚Ä¶ While I am relieved these employees will be back at work receiving their paychecks, the Nation needs long-term funding bills and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to achieve that goal. Since I took office just three weeks ago, I have voted 11 times with the House Majority to re-open the government and return those workers to their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of hardworking, loyal American public servants have been denied paychecks, forced to turn to foodbanks, and rely on the charity of friends and family by a President who disrespects and demeans them. Here we are, 35 days later, our national security strained, our economy hampered, and countless Americans left worse off, all over the President‚Äôs political ploy. The President today agreed to sign the exact same bipartisan bill that the Senate passed on December 22nd but that he rejected in favor of shutting down the government over a campaign promise he knew he could never keep. 34 days and counting. #TrumpShutdown #WhereIsMitch https://t.co/7VhLhEu1Vf 2019 is the Year of Air Pollution &amp; Health. Air quality in the US has improved dramatically over the past several decades thanks to the #CleanAirAct, but we have to do more in order to achieve #HealthyAirForAll. https://t.co/1eF3IJ3ZIF 33 days and counting. #TrumpShutdown #WhereIsMitch https://t.co/T8WTr04PB3 I joined local organizations to address the ongoing #TrumpShutdown, provide a legislative update &amp; address questions. Today marks the 32nd day of the shutdown with over 800,000 federal employees going without pay &amp; countless more directly affected. Read: https://t.co/LnSfew8pXJ https://t.co/cGdg2RPt59 I hope that the ban is ultimately and soundly overturned. And, even more disturbingly, it tramples on the Constitutional rights of individuals who are putting themselves in harm‚Äôs way to preserve the rights of all citizens.  The military has long been at the forefront of promoting civil rights and advancing equality. The banning of transgender Americans from serving in our armed services is not only un-American it is discrimination at the expense of military readiness. It punishes brave people who proudly put their lives on the line to protect our country. 1 in 4 women have an abortion in her lifetime. A woman's right to make her own health care decisions is fundamental and politicians and judges should stay out of it. On this 46th anniversary of #RoeVWade, I vow to fight to protect Roe. #FightforRoe https://t.co/nxtfwQbsCJ ATTENTION: This Saturday, I will host a District Swearing-In Ceremony and Reception at the DuPage County Auditorium JTK Administration Building at 3:00 PM CST.

My staff and local resource organizations will be onsite to provide information to audience members. https://t.co/g9KWl61urt So today, let us celebrate Dr. King‚Äôs legacy as he celebrated his own life. Let us celebrate the progress we have made, while still acknowledging how far we have to go. And let us use this day to commit to ensuring that his dream will become our reality, in our time. #MLKDay Not because he was proud of leaders who were sitting down, but because he found hope in the masses who were rising up. Not because we are perfect, but because we aspire to a more perfect union. Not because we have achieved true justice, but because it's a privilege to bear witness to history‚Äôs great arc. When he told that crowd in Memphis that day that the world was messed up, it was only after acknowledging that if he could pick any time in human history to be alive, that is the time he would choose. We have made progress. But we still have far to go. Dr. King understood this, and was an optimist to the end. And yet our nation is still sick. Trouble is still in the land. Privileged men of low character remain threatened by the realization of Dr. King‚Äôs dream. Those same men too often persist in the ‚Äúcruel jest‚Äù of telling bootless men to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps. Today we celebrate his life. But more, we celebrate his vision of that promised land. Did he see the day when we would have an African American President? Did he see the day when we would swear in the most diverse freshman class in the history of the U.S Congress? I think he did. He was assassinated the next day. ‚ÄúThe world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land.‚Äù 

Martin Luther King Jr. spoke those words on April 3, 1968. Famously, he went on to say that he had been to the mountaintop.  He looked over the other side and he saw the promised land. 27 days and counting. #TrumpShutdown #WhereIsMitch https://t.co/cjQUNMCa12 Attention: due to the federal government shutdown, new applicants interested in SNAP benefits must submit their application TODAY.

The House of Representatives is the chamber of the people-- all people. The long-running racially charged comments by Rep. Steve King have no place in the House.
