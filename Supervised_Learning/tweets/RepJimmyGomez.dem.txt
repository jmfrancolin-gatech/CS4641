Trump centered his ENTIRE PRESIDENCY around this false notion that undocumented immigrants are a threat to America.

Now we learn that he's been benefiting from their hard work for YEARS.

THIS is why I invited Sandra Diaz ‚Äî one of his former workers ‚Äî to be my #SOTU guest. https://t.co/Hchg1ASp9I With 96 percent of #Dreamers currently employed or enrolled in school, #DACA has given 820k young people a chance to make a difference in our country.

His answer: No. https://t.co/IzJSqcysjb 1/2: America‚Äôs history is filled with unwritten customs and practices that, once they were broken, Congress stepped in to codify into law.

Our future is possible when we work #ForThePeople  

#SOTU RT @KellieMeyerNews: @RepJimmyGomez @realDonaldTrump Virgin Islands here too. Which part of our republic did @realDonaldTrump forget to mention?

#PuertoRico.

No surprise. Trump has neglected #PuertoRico throughout his tenure. 

His treatment of US citizens in #PuertoRico will be one of the greatest and most shameful stains on his presidency.

#SOTU As you listen to @realDonaldTrump talk about antisemitism, please remember he once said:

‚ÄúYou also had some very fine people on both sides.‚Äù

We remember your words. We remember your actions. We won't forget. 

#HeatherHeyer #SOTU https://t.co/wRLuYsR6qI If we are to stay free, we need to protect the freedoms of others. We need to protect:

‚Ä¢ Women‚Äôs rights
‚Ä¢ LGBTQ+ rights
‚Ä¢ Immigrants' rights

This shouldn't be controversial. This is basic common decency. #SOTU If @realDonaldTrump was serious about #NationalSecurity, the 1st thing he'd do is LISTEN to his national security advisers.

But #POTUS has shown that he'd rather listen to Vladmir Putin than the heads of the @FBI @CIA @ODNIgov.

That's something that should concern us all. #SOTU Women of color are most harmed by this administration‚Äôs anti-abortion, anti-woman policies. From clinic closures to abortion coverage bans, women of color are forced to scramble to get the care they need. This is unacceptable. #ProtectAbortionAccess #SOTU Nobody has done more to undermine protections for patients with #PreExistingConditions than @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans.

Don't you dare try to gaslight us about that, #POTUS

#SOTU I‚Äôm proud to call these 106 women my colleagues. They are fearless. They are brave. They represent what happens when EVERYONE is involved in the Democratic process. #SOTU How is @realDonaldTrump going to stand there and rail against undocumented immigrants when his OWN businesses exploited them as workers?

By the way, my #SOTU guest ‚Äî Sandra Diaz ‚Äî was one of those workers. 

Thank you for joining us tonight, Sandra! I‚Äôm inspired by your courage. https://t.co/QaEQz9wczN Our ‚Äúmoral duty to create an immigration system that protects‚Äù lives DOES NOT include putting children in cages, separating families at the border, and building a wall symbolic of hate. #SOTU Despite what you heard in the #SOTU, there is no ‚Äúnational crisis.‚Äù 

Undocumented immigration has been decreasing for YEARS and attempted border crossings are at 40-year LOWS. 

The only ‚Äúnational crisis‚Äù was manufactured by this administration. No investigations?! Our job as Members of Congress is to hold @realDonaldTrump and his administration accountable. It's called Oversight. 

And you can count on @HouseDemocrats to do just that. #SOTU FACT: The VAST majority of @RealDonaldTrump's $1.5 TRILLION #TaxScam went to millionaires, billionaires, and powerful corporations.

Under the Trump administration, #WorkingFamilies are getting poorer and the rich are just getting richer. 

#SOTU Some examples of how @realDonaldTrump crippled #WorkingFamilies: 

‚Ä¢ Attacking the #ACA and people with pre-existing conditions. 

‚Ä¢ Forcing 800k federal workers to work without two paychecks. 

‚Ä¢ Pushing #GOPTaxScam that only helps the rich.

This is NOT #ForThePeople. #SOTU If wages are rising, why can‚Äôt we #RaisetheWage to $15/hour? No one should have to work multiple full-time jobs just to make ends meet. #SOTU 306 days have passed since the start of the #FamilySeparationCrisis.

Thousands of kids remain separated from their parents -- some of whom have been lost in the system. This is choosing anything BUT ‚Äúgreatness.‚Äù #SOTU #IncomeInequality, #ClimateChange, skyrocketing health care costs, aging infrastructure, and a broken immigration system ‚Äî these are some of the biggest issues facing America.

Will Trump propose real solutions or just feed more red meat to his base? We'll find out soon.

#SOTU Tonight, I'm joining my male @HouseDemocrats colleagues in wearing a white ribbon, standing in solidarity with the female suffragettes who refused to take no for an answer. Trayvon Martin would have turned 24 today.

His birthday is a reminder to us that far too many black lives are unjustifiably cut short in America.

#RestInPower, Trayvon. https://t.co/Bf4tcZCcp7 2) Sandra‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt just my family‚Äôs story, but also the story of many of my constituents in #CA34, California &amp; across the US.

It‚Äôs a story that needs to be heard.

I‚Äôm going to continue doing everything in my power to make sure @realDonaldTrump hears it today &amp; everyday. https://t.co/9g2a8pVAxB 1) Why did I invite Sandra Diaz as my #SOTU guest?

Her story ‚Äî one of an undocumented immigrant who worked in the laundry room of Trump‚Äôs Bedminster golf club ‚Äî reminds me of my mom. She too was an immigrant who worked the laundry room of a convalescent home to support us. https://t.co/k15h2rM8BX This was @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs plan to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the border crisis:

‚ùå Separate families

‚ùå Keep children in warehouses

‚ùå Deport parents

‚ùå Deny medical care &amp; compassion

They‚Äôre not helping secure our borders, they‚Äôre creating a humanitarian crisis at the border. #OurHispanicSOTU https://t.co/5o6kJhigz4 Happy #LunarNewYear to everyone celebrating in #LA and across the world!
