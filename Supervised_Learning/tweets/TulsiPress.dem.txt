Sending my heartfelt prayers and aloha to @RepDebDingell and John Dingell’s loved ones for their great loss. John served our country with honor and dignity, and will be greatly missed Hoʻomaikaʻi to Hiro Toiya, new director of @Oahu_DEM. Keeping people safe during disasters + emergencies is one of government’s most important kuleana. It takes county, state + federal coordination with non-government orgs and community to make sure people are informed and ready. https://t.co/qfOuOXnPbo Great bipartisan workout with @RepMullin, as always. These friendships matter — they help cut through the partisanship that too often gets in the way of delivering results for those we serve. https://t.co/oQ28zyXJiN After months of repairs to eruption + earthquake damage, Pāhoa Pool reopened today – a step in returning to life as usual. My team has been on the ground + monitoring the situation since day one &amp; continues to work with recovery efforts to secure federal funding. #PunaStrong https://t.co/6gxAdc7wpb Ho'omaika'i to Sara King from Ala Wai Elementary in #Honolulu for earning the Milken Educator Award! We are thankful for your tireless service to our community, leading with your heart and aloha for your students and colleagues https://t.co/7gAzVZrUaX We must bring our troops home from Syria quickly &amp; responsibly. Trump’s announced hasty withdrawal from Syria could leave Kurds vulnerable to slaughter by Turkey’s President Erdogan who has repeatedly threatened to attack them &amp; invade Syrian territory long-held by Syrian Kurds Ilham Ahmed has been a leader in the battle against ISIS in Syria, where the Kurds have proven to be the most effective ground force, and a strong advocate for peace in Syria. https://t.co/FR30ha7mLI Many thanks to Disa, Ann, and Desire for serving our Waianae High kids and community, teaching and mentoring our next generation of leaders. Special congrats to Desire who was named a 2019 School Counselor of the Year finalist by @ASCAtweets https://t.co/UDR2x2GprE It’s a slap in the face to use veterans &amp; their families as political pawns. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that Gold Star families won’t have to worry about whether or not they'll be able to afford to pay the rent or put food on the table in the event of a govt shutdown Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country w/ some paying the ultimate price &amp; their families sacrifice greatly. It's our solemn responsibility to honor them, support their families &amp; ensure their families receive the benefits they’ve earned. https://t.co/KhPemlNuqh We must ensure that our laws &amp; policies strike the appropriate balance: protecting our national security, while simultaneously ensuring the constitutional rights of Americans are upheld. There are 2 main things of great importance to the American people: our safety and security &amp; our freedom and civil liberties. It’s unfortunate that some leaders in Washington claim the American people must choose between them. This is a false choice. https://t.co/vLtJ6oyNht This is not about politics. It's about equality. It's about humanity. It's long overdue that we pass the Equal Rights Amendment and include equality between men and women in the United States Constitution. #ERANow In the past two years, we've inched forward with successful votes in Nevada and Illinois, and now we're just one state away from finally passing the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1923, the ERA was introduced to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and was reintroduced every session until it finally passed in 1972. However, because of an arbitrary deadline in 1982, by that time, only 35 states out of the required 38 had ratified the amendment. There are too many examples in our everyday lives where women still do not get equal pay for equal work and where we still face discrimination simply for being a woman. It's been nearly 100 years since women fought for and won the right to vote. Yet, we still do not have equal rights and protection under the United States Constitution. https://t.co/QPkMyO5Fat Read Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's latest e-newsletter for updates on the deal to end the government shutdown, burn pits, bipartisan legislation to address the nationwide nursing shortage, and more. 
To sign up for future email updates, click here: https://t.co/htH79Zyxa7 We cannot allow our government and federal employees to suffer and be held hostage because of partisan politics or policy disagreements. This deal to reopen the government for 21 days will provide backpay for federal employees, and allow them to go back to work while Democrats &amp; Republicans work together to address funding levels and authorities for border security and immigration concerns. https://t.co/RiAxQ7qyAT I heard from a federal employee who held a garage sale last week,selling as much as she could to pay her rent. Another in the Army Reserves told me if the govt doesn’t open by February, he’d be forced to volunteer to deploy to Afghanistan for a paycheck to care for his wife&amp; kids For 33 days, the federal government has failed its citizens. Over 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. https://t.co/Bf8sIruzki Our bipartisan legislation will help ensure that nurses in #Hawaii and across the country have the education, training, and support they need to continue their service. https://t.co/wNDfrpWpZE Too often, nurses are unsung heroes who provide life-saving care to our communities in the most trying times. As our country faces an aging population, increase in chronic diseases, opioid epidemic &amp; more, our healthcare workers must have the support needed to care for our people I’m honored to join Joaquin’s parents, loved ones and many more who have built this movement to protect our children and help to prevent future tragedies like this. We must take action today, in honor of Joaquin and thousands more lost to gun violence, and protect our communities The horrific tragedy that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 dead, 17 injured &amp; a nation of broken hearts in its wake. Too many parents, like Manuel &amp; Patricia, never knew they were saying their final goodbyes &amp; last hugs &amp; kisses with their sons &amp; daughters https://t.co/rUWuSiKI43 Today, my colleague and fellow veteran, @repbrianmast, and I are reintroducing burn pit legislation, joined by Senator @amyklobuchar and @Sendansullivan, to make sure they get the services they have earned. In Iraq, the cloud of toxic smoke &amp; fumes from the burn pit in our camp was a daily reality. I know the damage they cause. I've seen the devastating toll taken on my brothers &amp; sisters in arms who survived combat &amp; came home, but now suffer from rare cancers, lung diseases &amp; more So far, our government has failed to fulfill its responsibility to them &amp; recognize the toxins they have been exposed to -- just like what happened to our Vietnam veterans decades ago when our government ignored their exposure and the ensuing illnesses that came from #AgentOrange Over 165,000 veterans have registered their names in the voluntary Burn Pit Registry, but there are millions of our troops who've been exposed to these toxic burn pits during their deployment. They deserve recognition. They deserve care &amp; they deserve the services they've earned. #BurnPits are the Agent Orange of post 9/11 veterans. https://t.co/PSQ5gNRmnI Senator McConnell and President Trump must pass the House’s bipartisan legislation and re-open the government now. https://t.co/pveG18fvos Although our nation’s leaders have failed to step up, everyday Americans haven’t hesitated to take this charge, share their aloha, and care for each other. We cannot  allow our people to shoulder the government’s responsibility to function. Senator McConnell and President Trump continue to put politics before their responsibilities to serve the American people, leaving our working people unable to pay medical bills, afford their rent and mortgage, and put food on the table for their children. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees across our country are scrambling to make ends meet as a result of this reckless, 26 day-long government  shutdown. https://t.co/qS6q0nshPZ We passed funding that's sorely-needed by communities like mine, where people are still struggling to get back on their feet w/ limited resources. This bill provides funding for crop insurance, water infrastructure projects, crisis counseling, rebuilding houses &amp; small businesses But time and again, in #Hawaii and across the country, people have proved their resilience and strength and living aloha, taking care of each other even when they have lost everything. We were battered by natural disasters of all types last year on nearly all of our islands – from major flooding and landslides on #Kauai and #Oahu in April, an erupting volcano throughout May and June, and flooding and wildfires on multiple islands in August. In other parts of the country, there were storms and hurricanes that similarly devastated other communities. My home state of #Hawaii was one of them. 2018 was a tough year for so many Americans. We had families and farmers and people all across #California whose homes were destroyed, people who lost their lives, lost their farms, lost their businesses. https://t.co/ABmNMklUlm We cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters. These are real people, real families, real lives, and real futures. @senatemajldr and @realDonaldTrump must pass the bipartisan legislation we have already passed and re-open the government now. Food stamps for tens of millions of Americans are at risk. Low-income housing subsidies are impacting over 340,000 elderly and disabled veterans who depend on that rental assistance. The safety and security of our country is at risk. Our national parks are filling with trash, our Coast Guard members are working without pay, being told they should hold garage sales or start babysitting to help pay for the bills while the government is shut down. I heard recently from Jay from #Maui, who's a TSA employee who has been working this entire time without pay, wondering how he's going to pay his mortgage, car, and credit card payments and life-saving medical care that he needs to provide for his daughter. Jay is not alone. It's been 25 days -- 25 days since over 800,000 federal employees have either been going to work without pay or have been furloughed, all of them wondering, ‘How am I going to pay my rent or my mortgage? How am I going to afford the bills to take care of my family?’ https://t.co/3l3dgK1HMI We must build on progress made in #Hawaii and keep this toxic chemical out of our air, food, and water, and hold industrial agri-businesses accountable for endangering our people and our planet. https://t.co/REHt9U2xOg We cannot put a price tag on the health and lives of our people. The use of chlorpyrifos puts the health and well-being of our keiki, expecting mothers, field workers, agricultural communities, and our 'aina and wai at risk. The people of #Kauai suffered the painful consequences of chlorpyrifos being used in our community, where dozens of workers were hospitalized from exposure to this dangerous pesticide. I stand in solidarity w/ our working people &amp; will continue to fight for them. We cannot wait another day when so much is on the line --the stakes are too high. The Senate needs to pass our bipartisan legislation to reopen the govt &amp; President Trump needs to sign it into law. https://t.co/O9boEJdPTf It is costing taxpayers every day the government is shut down, causing suffering and hardship for families all across the country, and it is making our country less safe. https://t.co/WAi4ehZq8Y These workers are the backbone of our community, providing essential services that ensure our safety, security, and wellbeing. This shutdown is politics at its worse. https://t.co/wMeTX3HmG3 Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of federal employees in #Hawaii &amp; across the country will not receive a paycheck because of this senseless government shutdown. They are suffering and struggling, worrying about how to pay medical bills, rent, mortgage and other necessary expenses https://t.co/annP2uPBWA Under current law, vets are being shortchanged, failing to receive their full retirement &amp; disability benefits they've earned. This is ridiculous &amp; can't be allowed to continue. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that our vets receive the benefits they’ve earned &amp; deserve Our veterans have dedicated their lives in service to our country &amp; should not be penalized for that service due to a bureaucratic rule. Retirement benefits and disability benefits are two different things, and one should not be counted against the other. https://t.co/xnGlxCwxwP Congress must end its support for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in Yemen, exercise our constitutional authority over matters of war&amp; stop putting profits of the military-industrial complex before the lives of the American people &amp; people around the world https://t.co/S1fnDevvSy Here we are 100 days later and this Congress still refuses to take action to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia and to stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia. They spend billions of dollars spreading the extreme Wahhabi Salafist ideology that fuels terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda around the world. Contrary to what @POTUS believes, Saudi Arabia is not our friend. Since 2015, the United States has supported Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in #Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, caused millions of Yemeni people to suffer, starve, and get sick, and created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. This brought the world’s attention to #SaudiArabia, a radical Wahhabi theocracy, where the oppression of women and the persecution of Christians, Hindus, atheists, and other religious minorities, as well as the LGBT community is the norm. 100 days ago today, the Saudi regime ordered the assassination of a journalist named Jamal Khashoggi. https://t.co/ssxeV4hEqI Our legislation makes progress toward ensuring quality healthcare for all Americans. https://t.co/xtulJbfsqa They’ve managed to buy access into Congress, barring the govt from negotiating cheaper prices for consumers, so they can price-gouge those trying to buy life-saving medication&amp; rake in profits at the expense of the American people. No one should be forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for life-saving medication. But that’s exactly what’s happening to millions of Americans as a result of big pharma’s chokehold on Medicare. Our veterans deserve better than added stress &amp; financial hardship due to the VA's incompetence &amp; bureaucratic red tape. This law that I helped introduce will hold the VA accountable &amp; ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they've earned &amp; deserve. https://t.co/FQEQzb5J6I Great to be back at Honolulu Hale to deliver a Message of Aloha at the council’s inauguration. This new year, may we find inspiration, strength, compassion, and courage in the spirit of aloha which lies within each of our hearts, and share that aloha with others. #LiveAloha https://t.co/tSCuucFhfm Christmas is special because of time spent with loved ones + the spirit of giving all around our community. Last night I joined @danieldaekim, @keinishikori + @GarbiMuguruza at @hitennisopen to raise $10k for @HCFHawaii's Volcano Recovery Fund. Mahalo to all who attended! https://t.co/nl6PWd68WD Today, we take the first in a long line of steps toward comprehensive criminal justice reform. There’s no overnight solution to our broken criminal justice system, but this bill makes long overdue progress that will make a lasting difference. https://t.co/LvPRChRpPh Our veterans shouldn’t suffer because of bureaucratic red tape and incompetence. Our bipartisan legislation will hold the VA accountable, correct these egregious errors, and ensure our brothers and sisters in arms receive the benefits they’ve earned. For months, problems at the @DeptVetAffairs causing delays or inaccurate Forever GI bill payments for hundreds of thousands of our nation’s veterans have caused great stress and hardship on them and their families. https://t.co/hgRkOOQ5L5 Congress must act to end U.S. support for this genocidal war now. @SpeakerRyan must honor our Constitution and schedule a vote on this resolution immediately. More info: https://t.co/Rf0w0FVRzf Millions of Yemeni civilians are on the brink of starvation and lack access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed by bombs dropped on weddings, school buses, markets, and more. For the first time, the Senate has taken action towards ending U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in #Yemen that has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and horrific suffering for the Yemeni people. https://t.co/IWZ9lnix9c I successfully secured much-needed research and development funding to help #Hawaii farmers fight back against the macadamia felted coccid that has destroyed farms and threatened the livelihoods of dozens of communities, especially on Hawai‘i Island. This bill has finally opened the door for industrial hemp — a domestic industry that already has a market value of roughly $620 million in the U.S. per year — creating great opportunity for sustainable jobs across many sectors. It protects food stamps that nearly 170,000 of our keiki, kūpuna, vets &amp; working families across Hawaii rely on, invests in ag &amp; rural development, conservation efforts to protect our air, land &amp; water, clean energy programs, &amp; assistance for vets, indigenous &amp; low-income farmers The #FarmBill that passed today was a bipartisan compromise that provides certainty for working families, empowers small and sustainable farms, and expands agricultural opportunities for #Hawaii and across the country.

https://t.co/sRmF57sGCH Last night, House Republicans voted to block a vote on a bill to end US support for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in #Yemen.

Our families across Hawaii face many challenges - we must put their well-being before politics &amp; find ways to deliver results for them It provides a pay raise for our servicemembers, support for disaster recovery, funding for critical missile defense programs, including Hawaii’s Homeland Defense Radar, burn pits research for our veterans, opioid prevention and treatment, and more. While I have concerns about some provisions in this legislation, ultimately this bipartisan funding bill will take care of our troops and help provide essential services for the people of #Hawaii and across the country. https://t.co/GQt8HCSdEl Our bipartisan legislation makes a necessary technical fix to existing law &amp; provides access to ID cards, which will make it easier to apply for healthcare services, buy or rent a home, get a quality education &amp; more, relieving uncertainty for COFA migrants who call Hawai‘i home This legislation rights a wrong to ensure that tens of thousands of COFA migrants living in the United States, including more than 17,000 in #Hawaii, are able to access the services they need, empowering themselves and their families. https://t.co/JC0mF5IyR2 This funding will be available to support ongoing efforts to repair damaged farms and homes, revitalize our communities, and assist those affected in getting back on their feet. Despite all of our challenges, the strength and resilience we continue to see from the people in our communities is inspiring, as neighbors help neighbors, share their aloha, and pull together to recover from devastation. This funding is essential to communities like ours that have been challenged in so many ways, with very limited resources to help with relief, recovery, and rebuilding. The people of #Hawaii have been hit especially hard by natural disasters this year from major flooding on #Kauai and #Oahu in April, volcanic eruptions on Hawai‘i Island &amp; the recent flooding &amp; wildfires on multiple islands related to Tropical Storm Lane. https://t.co/w8lUSKO6AU https://t.co/yXZ4UzDvLb It is long overdue time for Congress to reassert its role and responsibility provided within the Constitution, and end our illegal support for Saudi Arabia's war now. Even after Saudi Arabia dropped a bomb on a school bus that killed 40 children last month, the Trump Administration reaffirmed its support for this illegal war—reportedly to avoid jeopardizing a $2 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. For too long, the US has supported Saudi Arabia, turning a blind eye to the horrifying atrocities committed against millions of Yemeni civilians since the start of this genocidal war in 2015. 
https://t.co/emkW1lnjCp Based on our country’s continued counterproductive regime-change war policies, it's clear that leaders on both sides of the aisle haven't learned the painful lessons of decades of interventionist regime-change wars most recently in Iraq, Libya &amp; now Syria. https://t.co/pvzyQYJG2z Sending my aloha and wishes for peace to all those celebrating #InternationalPeaceDay in #Hanapepe today. #PeaceisPossible

https://t.co/xMaLN8vJWx It is a blatant violation of the Constitution, the War Powers Resolution, and U.S. law. Congress must re-assert its authority and take immediate action to prevent yet another illegal, costly, counterproductive Presidential war. This is a complete betrayal of those killed on 9/11, first responders, our troops who were killed or injured in the fight against terrorism, and their families. Trump’s Administration has threatened “dire consequences” against Syria, Russia, and Iran if they attack al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups who control the city of Idlib, Syria. This week, as we honor the lives lost when al-Qaeda attacked our country 17 years ago on 9/11, the Trump Administration is threatening to start World War III in order to protect al-Qaeda in #Syria. #ICYMI- Reps.
