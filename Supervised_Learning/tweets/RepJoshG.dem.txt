Proud to work with @USChamber to help encourage members to meet in the middle and work toward common sense, bipartisan approaches to governing.

You'll never catch me rooting for the Patriots but congrats and all I'm sure you’d all look better in blue! When you see the tunnels up close, you realize just how risky the situation that we are facing is and how dire the situation is. Our visit to through the tunnels this week underscored the need for the Gateway project to be funded and set in motion. 
https://t.co/cfxoqnC9jZ If the tunnels between NJ and NY were to collapse, it would cost the American economy $100 million a day. We literally cannot afford to wait any longer to get the Gateway Project moving. 
https://t.co/4bEFpTVcaG The New Jersey 2019 Terror Threat Assessment makes two things very clear: we must remain vigilant and we must support our first responders and law enforcement to ensure they have the tools they need to fight terror and keep our communities safe.

Extremely grateful for the long hours being put in by our first responders to control and extinguish the fire at Marcal Paper Factory. https://t.co/Rv2NRWwrvO The 109-year old tunnels that connect New Jersey and New York are vital to one fifth of our economy and to leave them in such disrepair is irresponsible and wrong. https://t.co/WouIFpHFnw Investment in our infrastructure is one of the most effective ways we can spend taxpayer dollars.

Fire departments from Fair Lawn, Wyckoff, River Edge, Oradell, Franklin Lakes, and many more rushed into danger last night to help their neighbors. I am proud the amendment I introduced will guarantee that the 6 million Jews killed during the Holocaust will not be forgotten in the commemoration of World War II.

On this International Holocaust Memorial Day, we remember the 6 million Jews and the millions more murdered in the Shoah, one of the greatest atrocities in human history. This is unacceptable. I voted 11 times to reopen the government and I will do everything possible to make sure this never happens again. We cannot play partisan games with people’s lives. I want to thank them for their commitment to our safety, security, and to our country. For 35 days, TSA agents, air traffic controllers, FBI agents, Border Patrol agents, FAA inspectors, park rangers, and many, many others had to worry about how they would make ends meet and provide for their families. https://t.co/ktdca0QPhV Thank you to all of the first responders who helped rescue an injured hiker in Worthington National Park last night. Our first responders are on the first lines every day, of keeping us safe. We owe it to them to have their backs for always having ours.
https://t.co/55afb2Zfbn I'm pleased to see we have taken that step and are reopening the government for the sake of our safety, security, and economy — and for all the families affected by the shutdown. A week ago, when the Problem Solvers Caucus met with the President in the Situation Room, we discussed the importance of reopening the government, so we can have a constructive bipartisan conversation about immigration and border security. As we have for weeks, including our meeting with the President in the Situation Room, the Problem Solvers Caucus will continue to meet and develop substantive, bipartisan solutions regarding border security and immigration. The Problem Solvers Caucus applauds both sides for agreeing to open the government and sit down at the table to find a long-term solution.  We believe it’s best to engage in bipartisan, constructive conversation. We can't let this shutdown put a ground stop on our region's economy. Our skies are at risk and massive delays at LaGuardia and Newark airports are unacceptable.   

I've sent 11 bills to the Senate to reopen the government. It's time for action. I am committed to accessible clean water and addressing these problems swiftly https://t.co/Qod1zJZoW5 New Jersey families need clean drinking water and transparency about the water in our homes.

I was truly inspired by the work that I saw go on this weekend, especially from young people https://t.co/bhEdOIcfDd This weekend is an opportunity to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and reflect on how his teachings can help us to continue to fight for civil rights, civil justice and equal opportunity today. “The time is always right to do what is right.” We should always be standing up for our Jersey Values and having each other’s backs when they need it most. Thank you, Dr. King, for being an example of how to do the right thing, even when it’s the hard thing. We must open the government as soon as we can, and that means we need to keep talking. The shutdown has been devastating for our small businesses, our food safety, and the safety of our skies.

https://t.co/T9GYk9uNFG You’re never going to solve a problem if you’re not talking. Part of the problem is both sides are not talking. To come to an agreement to reopen the government, we have to keep working at it and we have to stay at the table.
https://t.co/EFyPaon2pq Enough is enough. We must come to the table and find a deal to reopen the government immediately.

On the train back to NJ! We just got done voting to reopen the government. I know that there is a bipartisan path forward that will reopen the government to protect our safety, security, and businesses, and pay those working without pay. https://t.co/wMdtXPZnw1 Yesterday’s meeting at the White House was productive and I am hopeful that, if we keep working together, we can find a path forward. I fundamentally believe that getting the government reopen is essential to our safety, security, and economy. https://t.co/2Hiv34qzLE Today's conversations between the Problem Solvers Caucus and the White House were constructive. There is a path forward and the only way that path is realized is for us to stay at the table and keep working to open the government https://t.co/ZT28epDjsd Concerned parents and a local medical expert in infectious diseases both know all too well the risks of sidelining FDA inspectors.

https://t.co/08OJdzop6e The shutdown must end. Any delay to the Gateway Project is unacceptable and this will not only harm the New Jersey-New York region, but also our country's economic growth. We must come together and move forward for the American people and keeping Gateway on track. We must all come to the table and work to reopen the government immediately The shutdown must end. The cost to the U.S. economy is $3.6 billion as of today, with another $1.2 billion estimated for each week it drags on (S&amp;P). The shutdown is bad for Jersey families and businesses. Small businesses in my district like Alementary are stuck because of this government shutdown. We need to reopen the government and get back to doing our jobs so small businesses can continue to drive our economy in North Jersey.
https://t.co/gvcA6j2YZW For breweries like Alementary, for craft beer lovers, for the New Jersey economy, for the safety of our citizens, Washington must reopen the government as soon as possible. $1 million in equipment sitting lying dormant, running up costs as the shutdown drags on, rather than paying for itself. 
https://t.co/IP0Pl2woeU In my first term, I clawed back 16 percent more of our tax dollars - that's $290 per household in our District. I will keep working every day to bring more and more federal tax dollars back to North Jersey for our schools, our roads and bridges, and our infrastructure. New Jersey residents got back a meager 82 cents for every $1 paid to Washington in 2017, according to a new report that highlights just how much New Jersey is subsidizing Moocher States like Alabama and Mississippi.  This is wrong and it cannot stand.

https://t.co/01bjO3JOAb This town hall series would not have been the same without you.

I'm looking forward to hosting many more “Cup of Joe with Josh” Town Halls in the new Congress and always being available to talk with North Jersey families. It is great to see so many people who care about our community coming together to have a productive discussion, and I appreciate Congressman Gottheimer taking these town halls to different diners across North Jersey and supporting small businesses like mine.” River Edge Diner owner George Siderias told me, “I was excited to see so many people out to talk to the Congressman about what was on their minds and the issues that matter to them when they came to my diner. I’ve really learned the importance of bipartisan problem solving from the scores of town halls and thousands of discussions.

By buying coffee and eggs, we have also supported small businesses from Bergen to Warren. Every conversation that I've had at these local diners has helped to form my issue priorities and legislation in Congress. I’m always sharing stories and feedback from our constructive conversations with my colleagues. As my first term comes to an end, I am deeply thankful that, in two years, I've had the opportunity to speak with thousands at 32 "Cup of Joe with Josh" Town Halls. https://t.co/jA3l7hoqvg The operation even continued while Santina was undergoing chemotherapy to treat her breast cancer.

Earlier this week, I took a moment to visit the Capitol’s holiday tree to reflect and be thankful for all those working to make North Jersey an amazing place to live, work, and raise a family in 2018. https://t.co/3Wy1bPeIKS Last week, #TeamGottheimer attended the Inserra Shoprite Supermarkets Holiday Turkey Giveaway.

Click here for a specific list of what is open and what is not: https://t.co/Hn8YSTOs0U We have to come to an agreement to fund the government so we can get this and so many more vital programs running again. As a result of the shutdown, funding lapsed for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) which provides life-saving domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, legal assistance to victims, and services to LGBTQ individuals. We need to do everything we can to lower taxes and make living in New Jersey more affordable, and repealing the cap on SALT deductions is a crucial step in that process. More than one million New Jersey families deduct more than $10,000 in federal taxes which means the federal Tax Hill Bill sent NJ taxes up, especially in northern NJ. The average SALT deduction in my District is more than $24,000. One year ago today, the Federal Tax Hike Bill gutted the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for New Jersey, slamming the state with higher taxes. Anyone requiring assistance with federal services or with questions about how the shutdown might impact them should please call my office at (202) 225-4465. My office will continue to provide constituent services to ensure that no Fifth District resident is left behind because of the shutdown. I will continue to work to get the government back open. It is unacceptable that our security will suffer as the Departments of Homeland Security and State close, affecting everything from US Marshalls to airport security to drug interdiction. It’s time we solved problems — not shut down the government. Shutdowns have an enormous impact on our economy, costing our country billions in lost economic activity and services. Shutting the government down is no way to govern. I am down in Washington doing everything I can, working with both sides, to make sure we come to a solution and avoid a shutdown. I will continue to keep you updated as things change. https://t.co/lWK30lkSiI Ms. Visocky has been a teacher at Westmoreland Elementary for 50 years, educating generations of future leaders in North Jersey. Congratulations Yvonne and thank you for your dedication to our children.

https://t.co/elStaRelLh Thank you, Keith, for continuing to be such a thoughtful, hard working member of our community and hometown hero! https://t.co/6ZAFoDNRx2 Keith has taken his retirement as an opportunity to make a real difference for families in Oakland. He's installing ramps for children using wheelchairs and renovating a floor for a veteran. https://t.co/Umsa2R7TLg ...and provide for the launch of a National Concussion Surveillance System. This long overdue research will help families in New Jersey and across the country. Yesterday, Congress passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. As a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, co-chaired by @BillPascrell, I am proud that this bill will extend federal TBI programs through 2024... I am proud that New Jersey passed bipartisan, common sense protections for our kids on the school bus this week. Now it’s time to help protect our children in New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, and across the country and pass both Miranda’s Law and the SECURES Act. https://t.co/g0i8WtrVKJ Congratulations to all our awardees! https://t.co/0C8ysJIQrC I love celebrating North Jersey's Hometown Heroes throughout the year. We have so many people in our communities whose quiet power of service goes on every day without the recognition they deserve, but make North Jersey such a special place to live.
https://t.co/htCgKJTrMw Americans expect &amp; deserve much more than more gridlock and more shutdowns. With just days before the government shuts down, Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair @RepTomReed &amp; I urge leaders on both sides of the aisle to work together, in good faith, and find a solution to keep the government open. I've heard from so many in NJ that they are tired of these shutdown threats &amp; that this is not how they want their government to run. I joined @PamelaBrownCNN on @CNN this morning to call for both sides of the aisle to work together to find a solution to keep the government open. https://t.co/lK88HugB2Z The North Jersey community rallying around Gabe and the Patnoi family in recent weeks has been inspiring. We're pulling for you, Gabe! #GabesGotThis

https://t.co/DQ8ZOE3Idl We cannot afford any more delays to the Gateway tunnel. My colleagues from New Jersey and I will fight hard in the new Congress to ensure invest in our infrastructure and fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels.

https://t.co/OK5uMjJLga These Hometown Heroes are bound by a shared sense of duty to their community – and I couldn't be prouder of these outstanding awardees. https://t.co/kjZK3x0UBL At our third Fifth District Hometown Hero Awards, I honored NJ community leaders, first responders, veterans, members of the business community, students, and seniors to recognize their dedication to improving the lives of their neighbors, families, and all Jersey residents. https://t.co/DflabeuoDd Last week, Team Gottheimer joined the Eagle Scout Ceremony for Zachary Simpson from Troop 140 in Blairstown along with Freeholder Jason Sarnoski, Knowlton Township Mayor Adele Starrs, Blairstown Mayor Steve Lance, and Hope Councilman John Kruk. https://t.co/14P5EiY7k1 These incidents are completely unacceptable, and, as a parent and your Congressman, I am committed to fighting back against this disturbing uptick of hate and intolerance by ensuring that instances of bias and anti-Semitism are swiftly addressed. ...and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness to discuss best practices to curb the rising trend. After the discovery of anti-Semitic symbols scrawled in schools in the Pascack Valley Regional School District, I convened a conference call with Superintendent of Schools Erik Gundersen, North Jersey superintendents, and experts from the @ADL_National...

I'm proud to say the bill has passed the House, Senate, &amp; heads to the President's desk to finalize the honoring of Frank's 48 year legacy as Postmaster &amp; his long career of service to his community &amp; our country. Earlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan "Frank Leone Post Office Act" to rename the post office at 332 Ramapo Valley Rd in Oakland in honor of NJ's last presidentially appointed postmaster alongside Frank's widow Ellen... 

https://t.co/8ajMrFDCtG I am so thankful for the thousands of people I've had a chance to sit with at "Cup of Joe with Josh" Town Halls these past two years. People are tired of the yelling and dysfunction in DC, and I love being able to come to these town halls and have productive discussions and talk to one another. Thank you to everyone who came to my "Cup of Joe with Josh" Town Hall in River Edge this morning. We had constructive conversations on a host of issues—from infrastructure to health care to cutting taxes. I appreciated those who joined me over breakfast to share their views. https://t.co/C2g6jgiFyP In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, guests took turns reciting the names of all Glen Rock citizens who served in the war. We thank them, and all who have served our country, for their service. #TeamGottheimer joined Glen Rock residents – including Mayor Bruce Packer, Councilwoman Mary Barchetto, Councilwoman Amy Martin, members of the Boy Scouts, and local veterans — to honor National Wreaths Across America Day. https://t.co/nrIN5Zaiu3 Thank you to Chief Joseph Madden, Freeholder Sullivan, Ortiz, Sheriff Anthony Cureton, Acting Prosecutor Dennis Calo, and members of community and law enforcement. Last week, Team Gottheimer helped remember those who have been injured by drunk drivers at the Candlelight Vigil of Honor and Remembrance, hosted by the Police Traffic Officer’s Association of Bergen County and the Bergen County Police Chiefs' Association. https://t.co/MGwJHqEyjk
