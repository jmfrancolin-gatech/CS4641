Since the day he assumed office, Donald Trump has repeatedly tried to undermine the ACA. While his Administration continues its reckless attempt to restrict Americans' access to health insurance, I'll keep fighting to expand access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/eOs0swUxzq Post-Hurricane Irma, Gov. Rick Scott insisted cities/counties avoid price gouging on debris removal. Then he did it himself, gouging taxpayers up to $30M in the Keys. Scott must explain this 'rookie mistake' and vow not to repeat it @DeFede @SunSentinel 
https://t.co/NSv5LfKcSG The ethical clouds may clear, but Pruitt's destructive EPA policies will harm our land, water and families for years
https://t.co/sIzU8fQNP7 Most states restore voting rights once felons serve their sentences, yet Gov. Scott blocked reforms that would have eased this restrictive and discriminatory voting hurdle in Florida. This Reconstruction-era relic must end. Let them vote!
https://t.co/Q4joFTMhN4 RT @repjohnlewis: Be bold. Be courageous. Never be afraid to speak up and speak out. Together we can build a more perfect union. #goodtroub‚Ä¶ Reporters seeking truth should not fear for their lives as they work in a newsroom. Neither should kids while they learn at school or teens when they dance at a nightclub. We can do something about this - and we must. This White House has tried to restrict access to health insurance through executive order, failed legislation, and soon, the Supreme Court. Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions are counting on us - and we can't let them down now. RT @NEAToday: BREAKING: #SCOTUS rules on #Janus, turns its back on American workers‚Äîeducators, nurses, firefighters, police officers, and p‚Ä¶ Some of the children in the facility I visited today are as young as 4 years old. These kids should've never been separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether It's clear the Trump Administration is not doing nearly enough to reunite young children with their families. This is not a one-person job, and right now at the Homestead facility I visited today, they only have one person doing it. That's unacceptable. #FamiliesBelongTogether When I co-founded the @CWSoftballGame 10 years ago, I would've never imagined that we'd be able to raise over $1.3 million for @YSCBuzz. We may have come up short on the field last night, but we'll be back next year. Congrats to the Bad News Babes! Yesterday @SenBillNelson and I were denied entry to a South Florida facility that is holding nearly 100 kids who have been separated from their parents.

They won't show us a single picture of a young girl inside any of these facilities.

They know what they're doing is wrong. The American people deserve to see the cruel way the Trump Administration is treating children. https://t.co/172YZd6IwN RT @AmandiOnAir: Disturbing news from @DWStweets &amp; @SenBillNelson that not only are children separated from their parents indeed being held‚Ä¶ RT @MichelleObama: Sometimes truth transcends party. https://t.co/TeFM7NmNzU "Irreparable harm."

Those are the words the American Academy of Pediatrics used to describe the damage Trump's family separation policy is having on thousands of children. 

This is about the difference between right and wrong. Allowing LGBT individuals to live their truth and love who they love is a cause worth celebrating - and we must all fight to defend the progress we've made. I had such an outstanding time being a part of @WMStonewall. https://t.co/Em8clFmHx2 The corrupt head of the @EPA is trying to get back in the President's good graces by allowing more water pollution. Think about what that says about where we are as a nation. And then go help someone register to vote. https://t.co/DYZMfnDUaV .@cspan Hey, it‚Äôs @CWSoftballGame‚Äôs 10th anniversary this year.

https://t.co/rcoqMaSxRE Donald Trump's decisions to separate children from their parents at the border and prevent victims of domestic violence from entering this nation make America weaker, not stronger. Either you're with the nearly 8 million Floridians with pre-existing conditions or you're against us. This really shouldn't be that hard, even for Rick Scott.
https://t.co/QnqBgHGK7R Preventing victims of rape and domestic violence from entering this nation does not make us stronger or safer. It makes us less American. I will keep fighting every day for the America that I know and love. I'm thrilled to receive the "Gun Sense" candidate distinction from @MomsDemand. Reducing gun violence is a public safety issue. It's time we take action to protect our children and our communities. https://t.co/ojgNXT6gKC As a breast cancer survivor, I am one of the 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition. Donald Trump's new attempt to take us back to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against us is disgraceful. We are ready for this fight. We will not go back. The right-wing billionaire Koch brothers will receive about $1 billion in annual tax savings from a bill they spent $20 million pushing through Congress. Now they're trying to undermine American investments in education, the environment, and our veterans.

It's even more shameful that many of these facilities still aren't providing our seniors with the care they deserve.
