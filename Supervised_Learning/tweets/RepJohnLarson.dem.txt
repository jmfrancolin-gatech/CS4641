https://t.co/rw3tjswPu8 I hope Secretary DeVos will take this opportunity to visit EHHS, where I once taught, to see what an amazing community of students, educators, and families we have. Bryan Hall, Chairman of the East Hartford Board of Education, extended an olive branch to Secretary DeVos and invited her once again to visit E. Hartford. https://t.co/ovrLQoJ387 Yesterday, I joined federal aviation workers at Bradley to stand in solidarity with them. I’ve voted 11 times to reopen the government. It’s time for the Senate to join the House in passing a bill to reopen the government. #EndtheShutdownNow https://t.co/POhVwjwSQK RT @UTCpolicy: Joining us via video today, thanks @RepJoeCourtney &amp; @RepJohnLarson for recognizing the importance of #trade &amp; bolstering ou… It is unconscionable that our air traffic controllers, TSA agents, border patrol, &amp; other dedicated employees are set to miss a 2nd paycheck. The House has voted 10 times to reopen the govt. I urge every Senator to support the CR that would reopen the govt and #EndTheShutdownNow Today I again voted to reopen the Federal Government. Every day the government remains shuttered, the consequences become more severe and the burden placed on federal workers and contractors becomes heavier. Social Security IS the nation's most effective anti-poverty program! Thank you to Nancy Altman and @SSWorks for highlighting how Social Security aligns with the vision of Dr. King. https://t.co/GcS7E0iJOI Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us that "Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men". Today, I join men and women across the nation in remembering Dr. King by recommitting ourselves to that effort for human progress. Social Security is a lifeline for millions of Americans. Share your story on how it’s helped you or a family member here:  https://t.co/wDAYahjyCZ Thank you to Kelly Evans for having me on @CNBCTheExchange to talk what the House is doing to #EndTheShutdownNow and how the @WaysMeansCmte will operate this Congress. https://t.co/3jK9lkbvce Social Security isn’t an entitlement, it is the insurance YOU’VE paid for! 

Please share your story on how Social Security has helped you or a loved one here.

https://t.co/wDAYahjyCZ It is outrageous that POTUS would consider diverting disaster relief for  Puerto Rico to pay for his border wall. This idea should be abandoned  immediately.    https://t.co/f7OtQFLQOD The House will continue to take action to re-open these departments and fund Department of Agriculture. The Senate must take up this bill and #EndTheShutdownNow The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is closed, so breweries can’t introduce new beer. Bad for beer fans and bad for small businesses! Hundreds of food inspectors have been furloughed, putting our food safety at risk. Small farmers can’t get access to loans to buy supplies for 2019, potentially disrupting an entire year of planting. The FDA is unable to review new prescription drugs, delaying potentially lifesaving treatment from getting to those who need them. Today, the House of Representatives voted to re-open the Department of Agriculture (again). Below are some of the vital programs that are impacted by the shutdown. #Thread This list is just an example of SOME of the pre-existing conditions people used to be denied health care for. The GOP is trying to overturn these critical protections. We can’t let that happen, that’s why Democrats are working to improve access to health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Nre2PBh5Xi Welcome and congratulations to our new Governor, @GovNedLamont and Lt. Governor @LGSusanB! All the best to you both, I’m excited to see what your administration will do! Thank you to @GovMalloyOffice and @LGWyman for many years of service to the State of Connecticut. Gun violence isn’t just mass shootings. Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence, some in our own backyard. I’m proud to join Democrats in introducing commonsense background check laws. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain https://t.co/0DR4SQocH9 It’s time for Congressional Republicans and the President to join us in reopening the government now. Let’s have a debate about border security and about comprehensive immigration reform, but let’s do it with the government open instead of taking the America people hostage. Last night, the President used fear tactics instead of facts, as @SpeakerPelosi said. The new House majority has already passed legislation that would end the shutdown. The American people are already feeling the effects of the govt shutdown &amp; it will only get worse if it continues. Yesterday, I met an air traffic controller at Bradley Airport who is going w/o pay to keep the traveling public safe. Many of his colleagues have been furloughed. It makes no sense to shutdown the government and not pay the very people in charge of protecting our borders. It’s time to reopen the government and pay our workers what they’ve earned. It’s time to reopen government. The House passed legislation last week to do just that and fund Homeland Security, the IRS, the FAA and more. The House will act again this week. I won’t stop fighting until the government is reopened. #EndTheShutdown Bryan works at Bradley Tower in Windsor Locks where 40 controllers are working hard without pay to keep the traveling public safe. That’s in addition to FAA aviation specialists who are furloughed. #ShutdownStories It was a pleasure meeting Air Traffic Controllers Bryan Krampovitis and Kevin Coeyman, who are keeping our airways safe without a paycheck during the #Shutdown. https://t.co/4qbsNFDMS3 ATTENTION! If you or someone you know has a #CrumblingFoundation, applications go live on THURSDAY to apply for reimbursement and repair funding. PLEASE SHARE! https://t.co/mlDIObaJ6q It was great meeting with @IndvisibleConn yesterday to discuss the upcoming Congress and the new Democratic majority. Thank you for taking the time to come in. I look forward to working with you on Social Security, election reform, and fighting climate change! https://t.co/dCpt7BJRDr Today I voted to re-open the govt. From the beginning, workers have been political pawns. The House, led by Democrats has approved legislation that re-opens the govt. It’s time for this shutdown to end &amp; for us to get to work. https://t.co/wNM78j7HxF I was also especially proud to support @SpeakerPelosi today. She is the first woman and first Italian-American to be Speaker of the House. She has been an strong leader on climate change, election reform, health care, and Social Security, and a dear friend for many years. Today, the People’s House returned to the people. Over the past 2 yrs Americans have used their voices to stop the repeal of the ACA &amp; elect dozens of Democrats to the halls of Congress. We will restore regular order and bring on commonsense solutions to help the American people. I'm honored to be sworn in again. Serving the people of #CT01 in Congress continues to be one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am also thrilled to welcome the newest member of the CT Delegation to Congress, Jahana Hayes, who is a true leader &amp; fighter for the people of CT https://t.co/aPCTSujyMy 1 yr ago the #GOPTaxBill became law. It was rushed thru Congress absent of regular order &amp; has had a huge impact on CT, where middle-class families are paying the burden by being double-taxed. In Jan. we’ll fight for real reform for hard-working American workers &amp; their families. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/X0kfL4VTAb Between Secretary Mattis resigning, the President pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan, and the stock market plunging, the President’s decision to have a government shutdown over a border wall is throwing our country into chaos. This is not the way to run our country. Border security is imperative in our nation, however building a $5 billion wall is not the answer and not the security measures our country would need. This funding is a waste of American taxpayers’ hard-earned money. #TBT when I fought for women’s Social Security benefits on the floor, and in committee. This fight isn’t over and I will continue to fight for women so they can receive the insurance that they paid into! https://t.co/kCvlz2fog0 Japan’s announcement to purchase 105 additional F-35s is great news for CT’s manufactures and nearly 3000 high-skilled workers who directly contribute to the program. The F-35 represents the very best of American ingenuity.

My support and prayers are also with the brave men and women battling these terrible fires. Today, we pause and reflect on the service and courage of our veterans and their families who sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms and values here at home. We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you veterans. I’m terribly saddened by the tragic news coming from Thousand Oaks, Calif. There are no more words for these atrocities in our country – only action. Congress must act to end rampant gun violence in America. I refuse to allow this to be normal.

Looking forward to next year! My deepest sympathies go out to the Tree of Life Synagogue community, the family and friends of the lives lost and the injured police officers. There is no room in our country for hate. We stand with the Jewish community, the Pittsburgh community and @USRepMikeDoyle  during this tragic time. It’s irrational that since Sandy Hook the House of Representatives hasn’t held a single public hearing to end gun violence. This must change. RT @SSWorks: Social Security is the insurance that you've paid for. @RepJohnLarson is fighting to protect and expand, never cut, those earn… Social Security is not an “entitlement”. It's time we correct this misnomer. Social Security is the insurance that YOU have paid for with every paycheck and I want to make sure it is there for everyone when they retire.

Check out the @AccessHealthCT for helpful tips:  https://t.co/XJLIUZCKOT I’ve got a solution to protect the insurance you paid for with every paycheck and strengthen Social Security overall! That includes a tax cut for millions of working seniors. Read more here: https://t.co/ARoZuzf6wV The answer isn’t ‘entitlement’ cuts. That’s Republican code for cutting Medicare &amp; Social Security  – the insurance YOU paid for. Why do Republicans want to cut YOUR earned benefits and hurt vulnerable seniors, veterans, and people w/ disabilities? https://t.co/aCUYmE5xjT Official data released by Fed Reserve shows that Social Security kept 27 million Americans out of poverty.
