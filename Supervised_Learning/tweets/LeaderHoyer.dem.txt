For years, I watched my friend John approach policy w a unique blend of ferocity &amp; tact. To all our benefit, he deeply loved this country &amp; took such joy in fighting for its future to be brighter. Read my essay for @TheAtlantic on my friend John Dingell: https://t.co/BDJMCg4aN5 At the request of his wife, my friend @RepDebDingell, I informed the House of the passing of our former colleague, dear friend, &amp; giant of this House, Rep. John David Dingell Jr. May John's legacy guide us forward as we seek to make this House all he believed it could be. https://t.co/IFL6sB0R88 RT @RepMikeLevin: Honored to join so many strong leaders as a member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

With his passing, our nation loses a giant whose vision helped improve the lives of millions of Americans over the course of his career. https://t.co/1iS2bGedYA I thank my colleagues on @WaysMeansCmte for holding a hearing today on the disclosure of presidential and vice presidential tax returns. The American people deserve transparency and accountability. https://t.co/XwEEhLyncw I had a meaningful visit w @StandWParkland to discuss House Dems’ ongoing work to #EndGunViolence. I am committed to bringing #HR8, bipartisan legislation to expand background checks, to the House Floor for a vote after @HouseJudiciary’s markup next week. https://t.co/zDrnX02wzt https://t.co/TzT0nMNEsX Today, @EnergyCommerce is holding an important hearing on the Admin’s inhumane family separation policy. The Admin violated federal law by detaining children &amp; have yet to tell the committee how it intends to #ReuniteEveryChild. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/csnQaKfE33 Today, I was pleased to meet Willie O’Ree, who became the first African-American @NHL player in 1958 &amp; was inducted to the Hall of Fame last year. As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, I am inspired by Mr. O’Ree’s legacy &amp; thank him for his work to promote diversity in hockey. https://t.co/DxahHSO1YF I thank the @EdLaborCmte for holding a hearing on the #RaiseTheWage Act. Raising the minimum wage will ensure working people can get ahead &amp; help local businesses by boosting consumer spending.  I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor following committee consideration. https://t.co/YXePHr0RAH I agree with Chairman @RepJohnYarmuth’s statement at today’s @HouseBudgetDems hearing: the #TrumpShutdown demonstrated the important role of govt services &amp; is an urgent reminder that we must #RaiseTheCaps in order to fund our defense &amp; non-defense budget priorities. https://t.co/IuW6tyyQy7 Appreciate @TransportDems holding an important hearing on #TheCostOfInaction when it comes to our nation’s infrastructure. House Dems are committed to taking action to invest in our nation’s bridges, roads, &amp; seaports &amp; urge Republicans to work with us on bipartisan solutions. https://t.co/PjZBhCEIlW Looking forward to traveling to TX &amp; NM with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS.

Instead the President focused on fearmongering &amp; misleading the public. RT if you agree he’s out of touch. https://t.co/piBe8YYCWT https://t.co/Arrsax0VzC The cost of #ClimateChange grows every day Congress fails to #ActOnClimate. Today, House Dems held two hearings to understand the impact of climate change on Americans &amp; our economy. The #116thCongress is committed to take action on this critical issue. https://t.co/6nlhX9Cx8c The @VP’s comment today signals that this Admin believes threatening to inflict pain on the American people is a legitimate strategy. House Democrats &amp; the American people will hold @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans accountable if they shut down government again. https://t.co/SxTJEMfV1u Today, House Democrats held long-overdue hearings on climate change &amp; the multiplying effects on businesses &amp; the environment if Congress fails to #ActOnClimate. Watch here as every one of the witnesses before @EnergyCommerce agree #climatechange is real. https://t.co/E63edyPLsD My friend @USRepMikeDoyle is absolutely right – the GOP led lawsuit in Texas v. U.S. attacks protections for pre-existing conditions, putting 133 million Americans at risk and raising the cost of health care. https://t.co/VwL0eafn9L I thank Ms. Heidi Gerding, a #MD05 resident &amp; veteran, for her testimony today about the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on her government contracting business. We’ll continue to remind @POTUS of the consequences of a shutdown for all Americans, not just federal employees. I was moved by the stories of small businesses &amp; contractors affected by the #TrumpShutdown in today’s @HouseSmallBiz hearing. Appreciate my colleagues highlighting stories of biz owners unable to work &amp; pay their employees or who could not access loans &amp; economic opportunity. https://t.co/RAMXmhvcme For the first time in nearly a decade, the House is holding hearings on climate change. I thank my colleagues on @NRDems for highlighting how climate change impacts the lives of Americans at their hearing today &amp; looking at ways that Congress can #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/TmtVDkTOIQ I applaud my colleagues on @OversightDems for holding the House’s second hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which will help increase access to the ballot box and address the culture of corruption in Washington, among other reforms. https://t.co/hCwbSf6nJy It is offensive for any Member to claim that a costly and ineffective border wall will prevent gun violence in our country. We need commonsense, bipartisan measures to reduce gun violence, and millions of Americans agree that #EnoughisEnough and Congress must act. https://t.co/yX3kro2ofj For years, House Dems have called for action to #EndGunViolence, &amp; today @HouseJudiciary is holding a historic hearing on this issue. I look forward to bringing H.R. 8, legislation to expand background checks, to the Floor following committee consideration. #Enough #NeverAgain https://t.co/DyTUJQdnYd In the wake of the #SOTU, here’s a reminder of the steps @realDonaldTrump has taken to undermine public health and our environment. In the 116th Congress, Democrats stand ready to reverse these harmful actions and #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/2VC3Mnq2hN Happy birthday to my friend, to my friend @CongBoyle, a strong voice for working families in #PA02 on the @WaysMeansCmte and as co-chair of @BlueCollarDems. Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepBonnie. Thank you for your leadership as co-chair of the @CBWGCaucus. Thinking of my very good friend, a giant of the House, and tireless advocate for the American people, @JohnDingell. I’m keeping him, @RepDebDingell, and the entire Dingell family in my prayers. https://t.co/3EBzwb2ORR When asked about @POTUS’ comments about investigations in his #SOTU address, I said that Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time. We have a constitutional responsibility and obligation to conduct thorough and fair oversight of the Trump Admin. I told reporters House Dems are getting to work on our #ForThePeople agenda with hearings this week on #HR1; protecting Americans with pre-ex conditions; raising the minimum wage; working to #EndGunViolence &amp; taking steps to #ActOnClimate. I also said to press I have faith in the DHS conference committee and am encouraged by reports that they are making progress. I hope Republicans will continue to work with Dems in good faith to reach agreement before the Feb 15 deadline. Another #TrumpShutdown is not an option. I opened my weekly press conference this morning saying that I was deeply disappointed in @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU last night. After promising a unifying message, the President’s address sounded more like a political campaign rally to appeal to his base than a State of the Union. During his #SOTU, @POTUS claimed that he has improved our nation’s security &amp; international standing, but in reality, his polices have alienated allies &amp; emboldened adversaries. RT if you agree POTUS’ policies have failed to make the U.S. more secure. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/4RtCB6QIyH RT @NRDems: Today is 10 years in the making.

Today at 10 am ET, I will chair our @Oversigh… Despite what was said in the #SOTU address, here’s a look at @realDonaldTrump’s record on health care. Democrats will continue to defend protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions and work to lower health care costs. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/gjI5dsw9q2 While @realDonaldTrump claimed credit for his record in his #SOTU address, his policies have failed the middle class when it comes to their economic security. Dems are focused on raising wages, &amp; I hope @POTUS will work with us to do so. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/d1t23u9B18 I thank @StaceyAbrams’ for her #SOTU response, which was unifying &amp; reminded us that America is stronger when we come together to fight for our shared values. Dems will continue to fight #ForThePeople &amp; pursue our agenda to help all working families get ahead. #AbramsAddress With our new Majority, House Democrats will move forward on the American people’s priorities.  In the weeks &amp; months ahead, Democrats will bring to the House Floor legislation to put government back in the hands of the American people &amp; make it more transparent &amp; accountable. In his #SOTU address, @POTUS leaned on falsehoods &amp; fear to obscure the reality of a presidency lacking in leadership &amp; harmful to our future. His words continue to make the state of our union more divided &amp; less adherent to our founding values. https://t.co/bVz8AlLcim In his #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump attempted to take credit for lowering prescription prices, but the truth is that prices increased in 2018. Dems are committed to lowering health care &amp; Rx drug costs in the 116th Congress, &amp; we’re getting to work now to deliver for Americans. https://t.co/SWJySKEbS1 Americans wanted to hear a #SOTU address tonight about the economy &amp; protecting access to affordable health care, NOT @realDonaldTrump’s costly &amp; ineffective border wall. Instead, he spent 20% of his #SOTU fear-mongering to get his border wall. 
https://t.co/piBe8YYCWT #SOTU Fact Check: Tonight, @realDonaldTrump claimed that protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions was a major priority for him. But his Administration has actively sabotaged the #ACA and protections for 133 million Americans who have pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/WSI7HZ38gB Fact checking the #SOTU : While @POTUS claims the #GOPTaxScam benefited working families, the truth is that it overwhelmingly benefits the top 1% at the expense of working families. https://t.co/IKMArtp7uR Fact checking the #SOTU: While @POTUS claims ISIS is defeated, just last week the Director of National Intelligence said: “ISIS is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria…” https://t.co/z3HhiPAP3D Trump in his #SOTU: “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.” 

GOP Senator Lindsey Graham in March 2017: “The border wall is probably not a smart investment.” There’s a challenge at the southern border – not a crisis, not an emergency. @realDonaldTrump’s rhetoric about a lawless southern border is nothing more than fear mongering and does not match the reality on the ground. #SOTU https://t.co/rc5p74HnBw .@POTUS claimed tonight that the U.S. is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 65 years, but his own Energy Dept says that won’t happen until 2020.  #SOTU https://t.co/5jmIZQ8ta0 When the President takes credit for cutting regulations, that means he is gutting clean air and water safeguards that keep Americans safe and healthy. #SOTU Tonight, @realDonaldTrump is misleading the American people about workers’ wages in his #SOTU address. The reality is that wages grew at the slowest rate in over a year – that’s AFTER the #GOPTaxScam was signed into law – in the last jobs report. https://t.co/JI1SZP0N3I Looking forward to hearing @StaceyAbrams respond to @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU with an optimistic vision for how we can unite Americans, give everyone an opportunity for a bright future, &amp; ensure working families have the tools to succeed &amp; #MakeItInAmerica. #AbramsAddress While @realDonaldTrump may claim credit for his policies in tonight’s #SOTU address, a look at his record shows he has failed the middle class and made America less secure. Read how here: https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix .@POTUS is reportedly going to speak about working cooperatively in his #SOTU address. I hope he discusses how we can work together, but, more importantly, I hope his actions reflect that rhetoric moving forward. Watch my conversation with @BretBaier: https://t.co/qO1P14lkiP Excited to welcome Jacqueline Beale to the Capitol this evening as my #SOTU guest. Congress ought to take action to protect Marylanders with pre-existing conditions, and I hope @POTUS speaks to this tonight. https://t.co/tFoBWLEaIb I discussed my expectations for the #SOTU on @CBSNews. @POTUS has been divisive &amp; confrontational in past addresses. Instead, I urge him to discuss how we can cooperate &amp; work together to reach solutions to the problems that confront our country. Watch: https://t.co/4AVNuKxL5j Tune in: I’m on @Facebook live w my #SOTU guest, Jacqueline Beale, a constituent, cancer survivor &amp; MD State Lead Ambassador for @ACSCAN. We’re discussing Dems’ commitment to strengthening protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/gmTjepkQwi I hope @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU address strikes a unifying tone and discusses how we can come together on Americans’ priorities moving forward, including raising wages, investing in infrastructure, and lowering prescription drug prices. Watch my discussion on @BloombergTV: https://t.co/OeLCd9mVj4 Proud to join House Democrats in wearing white or a white ribbon at the #SOTU to send a respectful message that we stand with women across the country and will continue to defend their rights.

In celebrating #BlackHistoryMonth together, let us remember how integral African Americans have been to every chapter in the American story.  I look forward to commemorating four centuries of Black History in America &amp; the tragedies &amp; triumphs of the African-American experience. I am proud to represent communities in Maryland with a long history of rich African-American cultural life &amp; civic contribution, &amp; I am also proud to work closely alongside my colleagues in the @OfficialCBC to advance the causes of equality, justice, &amp; opportunity for all. As we begin the celebration of #BlackHistoryMonth, we look to the extraordinary story of African Americans in our country, enriching our national life through civic leadership, military service, business, arts, science, literature, sports, &amp; entertainment. https://t.co/tTcDLgFGqM https://t.co/XSEvPusFqR While @realDonaldTrump is threatening another #TrumpShutdown, here’s a look at House Democrats reminding the President just what’s at stake for hundreds of Americans and the impact of the longest shutdown in U.S. history. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/toQ18sLomB Americans ought to be seriously alarmed by @POTUS’ feckless approach to our most dangerous adversaries &amp; Putin’s seeming ability to get this Admin to do his bidding. The Democratic-led House will use its proper oversight responsibilities to hold the Admin accountable. I am deeply concerned by @realDonaldTrump’s announcement today that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the INF Treaty unilaterally.  I am also concerned that the President once again is proceeding without coordination with our European allies. https://t.co/sjazbtXMKs Appreciate @HouseAgDems bringing attention to @USDA’s harmful proposal that would cut nutrition assistance for vulnerable Americans. #NutritionAssistance keeps 40 million Americans from going hungry, and this proposal has already been rejected by Congress. https://t.co/0v9xxRhTP6 .@NRDems, led by @RepRaulGrijalva, are collecting stories about how the changing climate is affecting Americans’ daily lives and routines. Submit your #ClimateChangeImpactsMe story here: https://t.co/MusuqVzUeP At the same time, this #JobsReport reflects a worrying trend–wages are not rising, even in a tight labor market, &amp; January saw the slowest gain in hourly wages in over a year. The #TrumpShutdown also cost $11 billion in lost GDP, further threatening our markets and economic growth. Today’s #JobsReport has to be viewed in the context that 800,000 Americans workers effectively had their jobs taken away &amp; were denied 2 paychecks, forcing them to go to food banks or to take out risky payday loans as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/iL1HFfbSg7 I share @RepAdamSmith’s deep concern that @DeptofDefense appeared before Congress for a hearing on active duty personnel at the southern border this week &amp; failed to disclose the planned increase in troops. Misleading Congress &amp; hiding information is unacceptable. https://t.co/pt8yxvvHiL On what would have been his 100th birthday, I join in celebrating the life and legacy of #JackieRobinson, who courageously broke down barriers during his MLB career and stood up for equality and social justice throughout his life. #JR100 https://t.co/adNwXOxOrg Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and fellow Marylander, @Call_Me_Dutch. Thank you for your leadership on national security and work on @AppropsDems to fund priorities important to Marylanders &amp; working families across the country. I am cosponsoring @RepRoKhanna’s War Powers resolution today because the American people &amp; Congress deserve the opportunity to weigh in on U.S.’ involvement in #Yemen. I am committed to bringing this resolution to the Floor after committee consideration. https://t.co/3hwjSalFQH The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy at least $11 billion. 

Today, every Member had the opportunity to vote for a resolution stating shutdowns are detrimental and should not occur. Notwithstanding the significant cost of the last shutdown, 163 House Republicans voted against it. https://t.co/JXBE91jjeS By refusing to say that they will take shutdowns off the table as an option in their negotiating toolbox, @HouseGOP are sending a dangerous threat to the American people.  How shameful. Today’s vote requires us to ask why these 163 Republicans believe it was appropriate to have lost $11 billion in GDP, which is what the 35 day #TrumpShutdown cost our economy, according to @USCBO. Today’s vote begs the question as to whether Republicans support requiring federal employees to work without paychecks or putting aviation safety at risk for travelers or preventing food safety screeners from protecting consumers. Today, 163 @HouseGOP Members voted against a resolution that says shutting down the government is stupid &amp; bad policy.  It is now clear the GOP has every intention of using shutdowns or the threat of shutdowns as a tactic to help @POTUS get his way. https://t.co/bsJ2aOZKf7 Shutdowns are stupid. Today, all Members of Congress will have the opportunity to vote for a resolution stating that shutdowns are detrimental to our country and should not happen. That is all it says. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes. RT if you agree. https://t.co/gFiIxbtBG0 After the costly #TrumpShutdown, Americans have been reminded how critical federal employees are to our nation’s well-being &amp; security. I spoke on the Floor in support of my bill to provide a 2.6% cost-of-living adjustment to civilian federal employees. https://t.co/r9Q2Wur0Hd I thank my friend and colleague @RosaDeLauro for her years of leadership on #EqualPay and her work to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act. I look forward to working with her and @EdLaborCmte Chairman @BobbyScott to bring the bill to the Floor this Congress. #EqualPay is an economic issue as much as it is a social justice issue. I was proud to bring the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act to the Floor in ’09, &amp; I joined in introducing the #PaycheckFairness Act today. I look fwd to bringing this bill to the Floor. https://t.co/z5zwBN2DrF https://t.co/KOUXkLs1NI I’m joining my colleagues to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act in the 116th Congress.

I’m proud to support these efforts and all those working across the country to bring about the long overdue ratification of the #ERA https://t.co/mrzP8XkjuO .@OversightDems’ first committee hearing of the 116th Congress focused on a critical issue that Democrats are committed to addressing: lowering #prescriptiondrugprices and increasing access to affordable, quality health care. https://t.co/KASsSZ0QzG 133 million Americans are living w pre-existing conditions. I applaud @WaysMeansCmte for holding their first hearing on the urgent need to defend these protections and hold the Admin &amp; Congressional GOP accountable for their attempts to remove these protections &amp; increase costs. https://t.co/hpvtXLYmRU Democrats are for border security, and I believe the Members negotiating a border security deal will operate in good faith to seek compromise. I joined @CNNSitRoom this evening to urge @POTUS &amp; Congressional GOP to work with Democrats to prevent another shutdown. https://t.co/UdUhmorHIL At today’s hearing, I appreciate that my colleagues on @HouseBudgetDems discussed how the #GOPTaxScam added trillions to the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthiest &amp; large corporations at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/fEhDVbDGaL Today, @HASCDemocrats held their first full committee hearing on the Trump Administration’s decision to maintain active duty troops at the border. U.S. troops are not a political tool and ought not to be treated as such. https://t.co/eAWWGEogtl I thank my colleagues on @HouseJudiciary for holding the first hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor to restore the American people’s faith in government once we complete committee consideration. https://t.co/vW2PwFAQZm For 35 days, @POTUS &amp; the GOP kept the govt shut down, leaving 800k federal employees furloughed or working w/o pay, damaging our nation’s economy, &amp; undermining national security. Here’s why POTUS shouldn’t be threatening to shut down the govt once again: https://t.co/bjqnGyPqMP Today also marks #Ledbetter10. I was pleased to bring the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act to the Floor ten years ago. I told reporters today that I will join my colleagues to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act tomorrow to build on this legislation’s progress. I also told reporters I will bring a bill to the Floor tomorrow to provide a 2.6% cost-of-living adjustment for civil servants. We ought to ensure pay parity between uniformed &amp; civilian personnel. I hope @SenateMajLdr will take up the bill once the House passes it. I opened my weekly press conference this morning by discussing the @USCBO report that said the #TrumpShutdown cost the U.S. economy at least $11 billion. I’m bringing a resolution to the Floor tomorrow to make clear that shutdowns should not be an option. Happy birthday to the Chairman of @HomelandDems, @BennieGThompson. I join in remembering the courage &amp; sacrifice of the crew members of Space Shuttle #Challenger, who perished 33 yrs ago today. I spoke on the Floor that day our nation lost 7 great Americans, including my friend Christa McAuliffe. I keep their families in my thoughts &amp; prayers. https://t.co/fdUxKKt3bw Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a powerful voice for small business owners and working families on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepLindaSanchez. Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and new Member, @repdelgado. I look forward to working with you on behalf of families in the Hudson Valley and across the country, including increasing access to affordable, quality health care. Today’s @USCBO Budget and Economic Outlook report shows @POTUS will go down in history as the worst president in terms of fiscal irresponsibility. There is no question that unified GOP control of govt over the last 2 yrs was an unmitigated fiscal disaster. https://t.co/U8FhSFKjUQ This shutdown harmed federal employees, small biz, &amp; millions of Americans who couldn’t access government services. I strongly urge @POTUS &amp; the GOP to work with Democrats in good faith over the next three weeks to responsibly fund government and prevent another costly shutdown. Today’s @USCBO estimate confirms shutting down government is a failed policy that harms our country &amp; people. The fact that the #TrumpShutdown directly cost at least $11B in GDP should give @POTUS &amp; GOP pause before they consider shutting down govt again. https://t.co/KY1Cwv38WO RT @RepDonBeyer: For years Republicans have punished federal employees with political attacks, pay freezes, and Trump’s shutdowns.

America… This work begins and ends with every individual citizen, to whom our democracy ultimately assigns the responsibility of rejecting anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism in any form. #HolocaustRemembranceDay On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember millions of lives taken &amp; communities destroyed. Let us not forget how hatred was spread &amp; doubt was sown in democratic institutions. We must learn from history &amp; confront new challenges w the wisdom of hindsight. https://t.co/H3JWBtmBb4 Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepSires. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to improving human rights around the world and building international partnerships on @HouseForeign Affairs Committee. Tonight the House passed a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown and pay federal employees. I hope the experience of last 35 days has taught Republicans that we should never repeat this exercise of shutting down government again. The #TrumpShutdown is the latest in a long list of attacks on our federal civilian workforce. This legislation is an important step in treating our federal employees with the respect they deserve &amp; compensating them for the financial stress the shutdown has inflicted on them. Joined @GerryConnolly to introduce the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 today, which the House will consider next week to the 2019 pay increase for civilian federal employees in line with the raise given to members of the military. https://t.co/CFtp0LsaWx It is deeply upsetting that the Trump shutdown inflicted real harm on many families in #MD05. Today I stopped by the Southern Maryland Food Bank to drop off canned goods collected by members of my staff. The food bank has seen a significant increase in the number of families needing their services in the past few weeks, including many furloughed federal employees. https://t.co/wXZvI6n1OW The Democratic-led House voted 11 times to end the #TrumpShutdown, &amp; it will do its part again.  Dems have always supported robust border security, &amp; we will work to ensure that we pursue border security investments that are smart &amp; strategic &amp; in line with our nation’s values. While I’m relieved @POTUS is finally willing to allow 800,000 federal employees get back to work &amp; receive the paychecks they are due – &amp; restore critical services – it is deeply angering that he inflicted uncertainty &amp; insecurity across the country for no reason for 35 days. It is deeply concerning the extent to which our elections appear to have been influenced by foreign actors who were in communication with close associates of the President.  The American people deserve to know the full extent of what transpired. The #TrumpShutdown is not a game and has real-world consequences. If this shutdown does not end immediately, the harmful impact will continue to grow. @POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr must reopen government and pay federal employees now. https://t.co/ZpK9VlCMkk Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and fellow Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Safety Caucus, @BillPascrell.

Thank you for your steadfast leadership and commitment to #EndGunViolence as Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. The Senate also rejected @POTUS’ demand for $5.7B to build his wall, making it clear that Congress will not support an ineffective wall. POTUS must accept that the way forward is to #EndTheShutdown, pay federal workers, &amp; then we can negotiate a border security measure. After refusing to hold votes to reopen government for more than a month, Senate Republicans voted to continue the Trump-McConnell shutdown today, irresponsibly ignoring the suffering of millions of Americans who are being impacted.  https://t.co/WKyBdfCnxo Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and @HouseBlueDogs Co-Chair for Policy, @RepOHalleran.

I’m pleased to see you serving on the @HouseJudiciary this Congress and look forward to working together on issues like immigration. 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay.

These public servants - who ensure the well-being and security of the American people - are standing in food lines.

@HouseGOP, @realDonaldTrump, @SenateMajLdr, have you no shame? #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/Ys2On4qrg2 RT @RulesDemocrats: .@POTUS has said he was ‘proud’ to keep the government shut down for ‘months or years.’ @HouseDemocrats continue to tak… There are two people holding government hostage – @POTUS and @SenateMajLdr – and @HouseGOP has been complicit in inflicting pain and suffering on our federal employees. Let's vote to open up this government, and then we can resolve the differences we have on border security. https://t.co/7OyhQyHwPW Tony Reardon, @NTEUnews President, also spoke at the #FundTheFrontline &amp; highlighted how many fed employees are currently working overtime &amp; double shifts during the #TrumpShutdown, yet they aren’t being paid. We must #EndTheShutdown now. Another panelist featured at #FundTheFrontline is @AFGENational President @JDavidCoxSr, who shared startling statistics about turnover as federal employees miss a second paycheck since the #TrumpShutdown began 34 days ago. Durkovich also highlighted the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on both federal employees and government contractors. There are already reports that top talent is being recruited away from @DHSgov due to the shutdown and lack of continuity. We must #EndTheShutdown. Caitlin Durkovich, former Asst. Sec. for Infrastructure Protection at @DHSgov, spoke about the importance of data collection &amp; info sharing that is on hold due to the #TrumpShutdown. Failing to #FundTheFrontline impacts our nation’s ability to strengthen election security. At today’s #FundTheFrontline event, emergency preparedness professional &amp; former Deputy Administrator for Protection &amp; National Preparedness at @FEMA highlighted how much disaster recovery work is on hold right now due to the #TrumpShutdown. The first panelist, Vice Admiral Peter Neffenger, a former Administrator of @TSA and former @USCG Vice Commandant, discussed the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on recruiting new service members in the Coast Guard. It is time to #EndTheShutdown &amp; #FundTheFrontline. I thank my @HomelandDems colleagues for hosting the #FundTheFrontline event highlighting the negative impact of the #TrumpShutdown on frontline homeland security personnel and agencies many of whom are furloughed or working without pay. Tune in here: https://t.co/TJMG6reqMT Read my statement on Venezuela here: https://t.co/x5Ch4T3MNU https://t.co/ulexRqVR65 House Dems have now voted ten times to reopen government, yet @SenateGOP refuses to #EndtheShutdown. RT if you agree it is time for @SenateMajLdr to stop playing political games and holding government hostage. https://t.co/NLr617F5Ki Today on the Floor, I said House Democrats have offered alternative after alternative to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen government. So why is government still shutdown? Because @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateMajLdr won’t take yes for an answer. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/tJrCy4MDIW House Democrats are voting for the tenth time to reopen government &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. It is time for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateMajLdr to #EndTheShutdown so discussions on border security can continue. Watch my discussion on @MSNBC here: https://t.co/iJBLF4qZId .@POTUS said he would be proud to shut down the government and that he would own it. 33 days into this #TrumpShutdown, poll after poll shows he does own it. The American people overwhelmingly believe POTUS is responsible &amp; govt needs to be reopened now. https://t.co/OBIvxtwzSV At my pen &amp; pad with reporters, I said that Democrats are willing to negotiate a border security deal but @POTUS and @SenateMajLdr must first open up the government and then we can work on a border security compromise. I also said to press that that I will bring to the Floor a package of six funding bills to reopen government today, which is a product of bipartisan negotiations.  Republicans have said they would support this legislation, and I hope they will do so today to #EndTheShutdown. Today I opened up my weekly press conference by saying every American ought to be disappointed in the Trump-McConnell shutdown. This 33 day shutdown is unacceptable and only our adversaries can be happy about this hostage-taking of our government. RT @RepDavidTrone: 33 days.
 
That’s how long 800,000 workers have been watching @realDonaldTrump hold their paychecks hostage as he tries… In a letter to @SenateMajLdr, I joined House Dems in sharing #ShutdownStories from federal employees in #MD05 and across the country who are furloughed or working without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown. Our message to him is simple: #EndTheShutdown today. https://t.co/Be3J1ApBDl The #NATO alliance is central to American security and maintaining peace and stability worldwide. I was proud to join @RepJimmyPanetta, @RepMalinowski, and @RepHoulahan to discuss the bipartisan NATO Support Act before it is voted on by the House tonight. https://t.co/BYzthu0yJI https://t.co/jyds2qxnQd I will continue to stand up in defense of #LGBT Americans to be accepted equally in our country in every way. I hope the courts will eventually strike down this ban and reaffirm the principle that all Americans should be treated equally. #ProtectTransTroops The Administration’s ban sends the wrong message to transgender people in our country that they do not have an equal place in our society.  This ban not only discriminates; it also denies us the service of talented Americans and makes our country less safe. I am very concerned that SCOTUS is allowing the Trump Admin’s #TransMilitaryBan to continue discriminating against transgender Americans wishing to serve their country as litigation on this issue makes its way through the courts. https://t.co/ePMLId7PqN RT @SpeakerPelosi: This week, @HouseDemocrats will vote on more bipartisan bills to re-open government, and act to bolster funding for bord… Enjoyed joining #MD05 constituents today at #MLKDay events to reflect on the legacy of Dr. King. As we commemorate what would have been Dr. King's 90th birthday, let us honor his memory and rebuke divisive rhetoric and actions. https://t.co/fXbLIydz4w https://t.co/nC3liuWFjQ As we join together to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, let us reaffirm his message of brother &amp; sisterhood as a foundation for our common enterprise of American democracy. May his spirit continue to guide us as we work to perfect our union. #MLK2019 https://t.co/gEmTO0Qeqy https://t.co/Yhbqyfa12w Welcome to Congress and happy birthday, @RepDeanPhillips. I’m glad the driver of the government repair truck has arrived at the Capitol and is getting to work for families in #MN03. .@POTUS must stop holding government hostage and #EndTheShutdown today. Read my statement on President Trump's speech today: https://t.co/sIgLX5Gd1k https://t.co/mNWxKMUxJj Happy birthday to my friend, @Kilili_Sablan. Thank you for your work to ensure the Americans on the Northern Mariana Islands can recover and rebuild following Typhoon Yutu. Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a new Member from New Jersey, @RepSherrill. Thank you for your service to our country in the Navy and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. I look forward to working with you on behalf of working families in #NJ11 and across the country. Excellent op-ed by my friend, @RepEscobar, who sees &amp; experiences life at the U.S. &amp; Mexico border every day. We will continue to urge @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans to #EndTheShutdown &amp; then we can discuss the most effective ways to secure our border. https://t.co/QMlaIyYllt Happy birthday to my friend and new Member of the 116th Congress, @RepDMP. I look forward to working with you to #ActOnClimate and address comprehensive immigration reform in the years ahead. Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend, fellow Marylander, and Chair of @OversightDems, @RepCummings. I am thankful for our years of friendship and your leadership in Congress. House Dems kicked off the 116th Congress by introducing our landmark govt reform package the #ForThePeople Act, to restore faith in govt, strengthen election integrity, &amp; reform campaign finance laws. I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor in the coming months. #HR1 https://t.co/jIi4BjIhNR OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT https://t.co/EgakqkIgN8 RT @RepRaskin: ICYMI: watch our video message from @Reagan_Airport with @LeaderHoyer as we stand in solidarity with @PASSNational and all o… I’m at @Reagan_Airport with @RepRaskin to stand with @PASSNational and @AFGENational calling attention to the fact that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are currently working without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/GIUUZHbrrI The needless continuation of the #TrumpShutdown is unacceptable &amp; detrimental to our nation &amp; economy.  Next week, I will bring to the Floor a package of 6 approps bills that represent the compromise position negotiated by Dems &amp; GOP in the House &amp; Senate. https://t.co/TOebtUBWWB I hope the lifting of sanctions would be stayed until Congress has the ability to conduct an adequate briefing and review. Following House passage of my resolution to block the Admin lifting sanctions on companies associated with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, I’ve written to @USTreasury Secretary Mnuchin asking for a delay in the lifting of these sanctions.  https://t.co/LjgIVwML1k https://t.co/Z6UHgybbX1 I urge @SenateMajLdr to take up this resolution this afternoon to keep America safe from foreign adversaries and maintain sanctions against companies controlled by Mr. Deripaska. Pleased the House passed my bill to prevent the Admin from lifting sanctions on companies controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. I urge the Senate to reconsider their position &amp; join the House in protecting the American people against foreign interference &amp; corruption. https://t.co/tpHXVsBIRR .@POTUS’ own economic advisors said the #TrumpShutdown could cost the United States half a point in GDP. It is time for President Trump &amp; Congressional Republicans to abandon this failed policy &amp; reopen government. Watch my interview on @BloombergTV on the need to #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/31lCxk1CZT Resources are available for Prince George’s County residents impacted by the partial government shutdown. Click here for more information from @PrinceGeorgesMD: https://t.co/rRPNmIbzo5 We were sent here by our people to make govt work &amp; what have Republicans done? @SenateMajLdr won't put anything on the Senate Floor that @POTUS won't sign. We're a co-equal branch. We're better than this. Dems will keep voting to #EndTheShutdown &amp; put people back to work. https://t.co/Be1wA18zvI RT @RepSusieLee: My fellow new Members &amp; I were elected to work.

We must reopen government and then Democrats are prepared to negotiate the best way to secure our borders. Watch the interview here: https://t.co/Z5UcfXNUVk Proud to join House and Senate Dems to introduce the #RaiseTheWage Act, which is good for workers, businesses, and our economy. I look forward to working with @EdLaborCmte Chair @BobbyScott to bring this to the Floor &amp; give 40 million Americans a raise. https://t.co/iUzwFRiYyo https://t.co/MeDySrsd6E I will be working with my colleagues to understand how this incident occurred and whether the @POTUS’ announced withdrawal had any impact on the safety of our forces there. The deadly attack in #Syria was a horrific reminder that the battle against ISIS continues. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the families of the 4 fallen Americans. Syria remains destabilized, &amp; a sudden American withdrawal will only make it more dangerous. https://t.co/78AWIHDrFS I continue to be outraged by reports that #LGBT people in Chechnya have been detained &amp; tortured by the government. I implore the @StateDept &amp; the international community to condemn and take action to investigate these reports. https://t.co/saClx4v3xD Resources are available for Charles County residents impacted by the partial government shutdown.

Click here for more information from @AACountyGovt: https://t.co/9zz3geLhdT Additionally today, House Dems passed supplemental disaster relief funding to help #OurFellowAmericans recover from natural disasters that struck in 2018, with additional assistance to Puerto Rico &amp; USVI, which continue to rebuild from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Democrats will continue to stand firm in opposing the President’s shutdown strategy and in support of the principle that in a democracy one side cannot threaten shutdowns and harm to our citizens if it doesn’t get everything it demands. House Dems once again voted to reopen govt while 187 @HouseGOP voted to keep it shut down. Meanwhile, 800,000 federal employees &amp; their families are finding it harder to make ends meet, &amp; Americans are being denied the services they expect from govt.  https://t.co/o52RVITtwM https://t.co/fqgmZHbl8H Pleased to see my good friend, @RepScottPeters, will continue to serve in Congress. He’s been a powerful advocate for working families in #CA52 &amp; an important voice in our caucus. I'm proud to continue to work together to advocate for the middle class, veterans, &amp; small biz.
