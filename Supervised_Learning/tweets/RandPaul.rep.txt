The Senate should investigate FBI methods and selective prosecution of Trump officials. TIME FOR HEARINGS! Justice is supposed to be blind.

The swamp is unhappy tonight, but America is thrilled I’m tired of America doing everyone’s fighting. I’m tired of America paying for everyone’s wars! How about we take care of our own homeland? I’m glad @realDonaldTrump isn’t letting everyone take advantage of us! We must fight when needed, but we can’t be the world’s policeman! I want to compliment @realDonaldTrump for being bold and brave! We’ve been in Afghanistan for far too long! Let’s stop spending money there and start spending it here at home. The war caucus, Republican and Democrat, agree on one thing – American soldiers must not come home – EVER! Apparently, these warmongers believe you can’t come home quickly or slowly. So, supporters of forever war have defined coming home after 17 years as too precipitous and condemned a planned withdrawal as too deliberate. These same supporters of forever war argue that if we set a timetable for coming home that we are telegraphing to the enemy our plans and our actions are too deliberate. Finally, after 17 years, we have a President bold enough to declare victory and bring our troops home and the warmongers have the gall to claim that coming home, after 17 years, is precipitous? Precipitously? How laughable and ludicrous is that description. How could anyone with a straight face argue that declaring victory and coming home after nearly two decades is precipitous. This resolution condemns President Trump for ‘precipitously’ bringing troops home from Afghanistan.

https://t.co/Qi6KQ4sxWd So everyone enjoy your feats of strength today. Air your grievances here or in your home.  But remember, thanks to Donald Trump we are ALL saying Merry Christmas this year — so repeat after me: MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY HOLIDAYS to everyone even the haters and losers. All kidding aside, they were important, bipartisan reforms that show how Washington CAN work if people from both sides of the aisle get together on things that make sense. I’m proud to have been a part of both. But then we exchanged some thoughts about bipartisan reforms we could work on, like hemp legalization and criminal justice reforms. Well, it’s a Festivus miracle because Congress passed and the President signed BOTH of those things this week. I’m going to close today by talking about something good that has happened. In fact, some could even say it has its beginnings right here on #Festivus twitter a few years ago. I poked a little fun at my friend Corey Booker. I hear they’re piping this into his office now for the entire Christmas season. .https://t.co/KLPpLHavSy I opposed John Bolton being hired. But I really can’t think of anything that makes me happier then thinking of him having to end wars for the rest of his time in the White House. Well, actually…let’s talk about John Bolton. I don’t have a grievance. I just really would have liked to have been in the room when the POTUS told him to END a war. How many times do you think he made the President repeat it because he didn’t even know what the words meant? I’m going to go a bit easier on the grievances against the neocons and warmongers this year though.  The Weekly Standard has folded, wars are ending — I really think their holiday is already bad enough, I don’t want to pile on. Many of these people hold these two views: 1 - that it was horrible to leave the war in Syria and 2 - that it is horrible that General Mattis left, since he was what kept the President from starting WWIII or something. I don’t understand how you hold both of those views. Grievance against the foreign policy establishment of both parties in DC: Lindsay and I were on the same side on foreign policy for about 5 minutes a few weeks ago, regarding the Saudis. He said it was a sign of “end times”.  I guess we are all gonna live a bit longer after all. I have to tell you; I haven’t seen a Senator who loves war this much since the Star Wars Prequels. https://t.co/UFU242XYQK My friend Lindsay Graham is a bit mad right now. You see, he’s never seen a war end before. He’s going to have to console himself with the fact that we still are in about 8 more. I know it will be hard for him, but I think he’ll get by. Ted really should have grown that beard before he ran for President. He looks less Canadian now. Congress has now decided to shut down the government because they aren’t spending enough money. I got suspicious when Ted Cruz came back from Thanksgiving break with that beard. https://t.co/y0r3dpFbbG So moving down the road to Congress.  Oh, Congress. Every year it seems things get more absurd. They were so bad this week they made my friend Mike Lee say “doggone”.  It was nuts. It will be quite lovely really. And It was on sale for $99, so we can open the government back up now. I did something to help the President out though. I found him a wall I think will work on the border. https://t.co/gx7ejwn1RU And folks, that is NOT who you want in charge of your Middle East peace plans. Speaking of criminal justice reform, I have to give Jared Kushner credit. He was great on this. And I’m glad I got to know him, because before that I was a bit suspicious he was the kid from the Omen movie all grown up. People are saying that with the recent passage of criminal justice reform, and coming home from wars, that I have a lot of influence on the President. It is true I’m on the phone with him a good amount. But I have to tell you, I haven’t gotten a word in on him in over a year. Mick is a good friend of mine, in fact a lot of people probably don’t remember he was the national co-chair for my Presidential campaign. Uh oh, probably just got him fired. https://t.co/3jH3ZsZh8r Let’s start with POTUS I like the President, I honestly do. I know people don’t believe me. But the man seems to have a problem keeping staff around him. But they solved the problem. I went to the White House the other day and there were at least 14 ppl in Mick Mulvaney masks. https://t.co/u0nnGWQ7V0 You’ll be surprised to learn I have some grievances with people in Washington, fellow members and others. It’s time to talk about them now, because it’s the holiday season. I came to say Happy #Festivus to my friend Elizabeth Warren. Cant find her. https://t.co/A4xSJ7Nf7x This is actually my grievance with liberals. They want the government to do more and more, take over more healthcare, more education — I mean you seen what it ALREADY is doing? Speaking of which, buried in the foreign aid reports last year, I discovered something — we give foreign aid to China. So government is so dumb, it is literally borrowing money from China, to give it back to China, while paying interest on it. So of course, instead of fixing waste like this and reforming government, the geniuses in Congress decided to have a fight over how much MORE money they were going to “spend” aka borrow from China. $75k to throw lizards around with a leaf blower: https://t.co/vbTkpbKVOc https://t.co/nA7ZA9JdCA $2 mil on daydreaming: https://t.co/vbTkpbKVOc https://t.co/IWWDtK3kyg The USAID spending $18 mil to promote tourism....in Egypt: https://t.co/vbTkpbKVOc https://t.co/SBbcUU2uDi Everyone's favorite frisky quail are back with an update on how much money they blew: https://t.co/vbTkpbKVOc https://t.co/KjPL4fKzvt One of the things I hate most about Washington is that they have literally NO IDEA how to spend your money.

For years I led the charge on these issues so KY could see more success stories like today’s exciting news in Mayfield, KY! https://t.co/r5HdqNMbWE RT @jackhunter74: "Libertarians such as @RandPaul have been pounding the podium for years that the problem is unchecked power itself, not m… Congress must reassert its war authority and stop being complicit in these atrocities. https://t.co/nes1gY509K RT @jackhunter74: "Congress has stood up, grabbed their constitutional power and said to a president, 'You can't go to war without our perm… Saudi Arabia has been committing atrocities against civilians in Yemen, and we should have NOTHING to do with it. https://t.co/ovs5EzypEo RT @ChrisMurphyCT: Two years ago, when @RandPaul and I introduced a bill to cut arms sales to Saudi Arabia, only 27 Senators voted with us.… RT @justinamash: Are you listening, @SpeakerRyan?

Today, in an historic vote, the Senate sent a clear message to Saudi Arabia that we will not turn a blind eye to their abuse of human rights, killing of dissidents and innocent Yemenis, and fueling of a humanitarian crisis. https://t.co/oO1QQG2Lbk RT @pennjillette: Hung with ⁦@RandPaul⁩ for a while.

I have introduced in the past, and will do so again in a new Congress, legislation to cut off all funding to the PA for supporting terrorism! https://t.co/Enwl7CK62V RT @SenMikeLee: Thank you, @RandPaul. Let’s get this done! https://t.co/nzDKyt7MVA RT @johncardillo: .@RandPaul joining me now on @newsmax America Talks Live. “The GOP-controlled Senate will vote on a sweeping bill to overhaul the nation’s criminal justice system before the end of the year.”
