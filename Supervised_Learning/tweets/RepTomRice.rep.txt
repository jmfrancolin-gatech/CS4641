In their zeal to attack this President, Democrats are weaponizing the IRS, just like they've weaponized the FBI and DOJ. I won't stand by while they hold sham hearings to score political points.

Watch more: https://t.co/RaSZabSlpp üö® FACT CHECKüö® : There is NO law that requires the president to disclose his tax returns.... but Democrats want you to believe there is. Saying President Trump isn't complying with the law is an abject falsehood. https://t.co/SHAs8JwiFz It is beyond belief that we even have to debate protecting the lives of newborn babies, but I will continue to fight for the sanctity of every life.

https://t.co/F7OSmTOUrD The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure any infant born alive after an abortion receives the same level of care as other newborns. We are in the process of collecting signatures to force Speaker Pelosi to bring this bill to the floor for a vote. I cannot believe this would be celebrated in the United States. It is unconscionable. In the State of the Union, President Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to ban the late-term abortion of babies who can feel pain in the womb. We‚Äôre already getting to work. In NY, they actually lit up the One World Trade Center to ‚ÄúCELEBRATE‚Äù the passage of a bill that allows abortions to be performed right up to the moment of birth. In VA, the gov advocated for a bill that allows abortion to be performed when the mother is ‚Äúabout to give birth." I give @POTUS an A+ on last night‚Äôs State of the Union. It was interesting to me that Democrats didn‚Äôt express support for economic growth, record low minority unemployment, and a renewed resolve against socialism at last night‚Äôs #SOTU. https://t.co/YsS7JOnP3t Democrats' refusal to secure our border is out of step with America and certainly out of step with South Carolina! https://t.co/v6PZhmOBrm Hopefully Democrats will answer President Trump's call to reject the politics of resistance so that we can continue to uplift all Americans. It's just plain sad that Democrats won't join us in celebrating the successes our constituents are sharing or rise in support of the American values and freedoms we hold dear. President Trump announced that we have achieved the lowest minority unemployment in decades. Radio silence from the Democrats. He renewed our resolve against socialism. We saw scowls across the aisle! .@POTUS's call for unity in last night's #SOTU was inspiring and uplifting, but unfortunately many Democrats refused to recognize our achievements or express support for policies that will move our country forward. My full statement on #SOTU: https://t.co/vTo1dKbhht ‚ÄúWe are born free, and we will stay free.

Democrats are three for three on not paying furloughed government employees during the shutdown. It's past time for Speaker Pelosi to come to the negotiating table so that we can secure the border, pay federal workers, and end the shutdown. https://t.co/AXZvKeoski It's a tall task, but I have faith that this collaborative effort will yield real results for those most vulnerable to flooding in #SC07. The purpose of the Commission is to find innovative solutions to mitigate flooding in South Carolina. Gov. McMaster called on experts from all sectors &amp; industries across the state to find ways to mitigate, prepare, &amp; protect SC against future flooding. Just participated in a productive #SouthCarolina Floodwater Commission meeting. The meeting focused on identifying federal funding sources to support task force initiatives, which will be my primary role on the Commission.

She cannot continue to complain if she refuses to negotiate.

https://t.co/VqvtG8UlKm Instead of offering the same doomed bill 11 times, Speaker Pelosi should come to the negotiating table. President Trump put forward a good faith proposal rooted in bipartisanship. While it certainly isn't exactly what I wanted or what Mrs. Pelosi wanted, it is a starting point. Instead of participating in meaningful negotiations, Speaker Pelosi wasted time bringing the same sham bill that includes $0 for border security to the House floor. It's time for her to work with the President instead of against the American people. Enough is Enough. Today, @HouseGOP voted to pay federal employees while we work to reopen the government and secure our border. Before deciding to go home early for the weekend, 215 Democrats voted to deprive federal workers of their pay. Democratic leadership should spend less time working against President Trump and more time working across the aisle to address the crisis at our southern border and reopen the government. WATCH: "A bus in Mexico drops off dozens of migrants and then they simply walk across a stretch of the Arizona border." Apparently Democrats see nothing wrong with unchecked, uncontrolled illegal immigration into this country. They continue to complain, but refuse to negotiate. https://t.co/nTa1FTgXxs He had a dream.

https://t.co/fWESLWTguT This is a political game to them- and they're playing to win. But they're playing with the lives of people in South Carolina who are hurting and need our help. It's time Democrats come to the table to provide disaster relief, secure our border, and reopen the government. Democrats they made the disaster relief bill subject to opening the govt. w/o border security by adding a CR to the bill at the last minute. The added CR was a poison pill that ensured that an otherwise legitimate, bipartisan bill won't be considered by the Senate or @POTUS. I even offered an amendment to this bill that would have streamlined the rebuilding process and helped people get back into their homes as quickly as possible. Democrats' shutdown tactics reached a new low today. The House considered a bill that would have provided disaster relief funding for South Carolina, and surely would have been signed into law once the Democrats decided to stop with their games and reopen the government. RT @RepCloakroom: We have begun 10 minutes of debate on the Rep. Rice (R-SC) @RepTomRice Amendment No. 3 RT @HouseGOP: Democrats of 2019, meet Democrats of 2014.

From depressed wages, to human trafficking, drugs, and violent crime, our failure to secure our border is a national disgrace.

Kendrick serves in the @USArmy and has just been assigned to the Honor Guard at Arlington National Cemetery! He is doing our hometown and district proud! https://t.co/yEiBJT8Uq4 How many more people have to die before Democrats get serious about illegal immigration and open borders? Meanwhile, President Trump and @HouseGOP have been ready to discuss ways to pass a comprehensive border security strategy that will give our Border Patrol Officers the resources they need to protect American citizens from the scourges coming across our border. Update --&gt;Unfortunately, we saw more of the same from Democrats this week. Instead of seriously coming to the negotiating table, (Speaker Pelosi offered President Trump $1 for a border wall), House Dems brought forward spending bills that included 0 funding for border security. Thank you, @MBPDSC Patrolman McMahon, for your years of service in our community and for keeping Myrtle Beach High School students safe! Enjoy your retirement! https://t.co/BrKLBi6sdu I agree. Action needs to be taken to save lives in #SC07 and across the nation. We need to cut off the source of these drugs. We need to #SecureOurBorder. 

https://t.co/51cVYaG4NI Democrats are acting like @realDonaldTrump only wants to build a 2,000 mile wall. Here‚Äôs the truth: President Trump's comprehensive border security plan includes 234 miles of new physical barriers, more personnel, technology, and additional resources that will #SecureOurBorder. #ThrowbackThursday to when Democrats went on the record in support of a border security strategy that included physical barriers.

Democrats need to come to the table and secure the border! 2. Democrats have voted for wall funding in the past and have gone on the record about how illegal immigration and open borders are harmful to our country. They are only opposing increased border security because they dislike President Trump and do not want to see him succeed. .@seanhannity makes good points here:

1. Americans are dying at an alarming rate from drug overdoses. Many of these dangerous drugs, especially synthetic opioids, are coming across our porous southern border.

https://t.co/CxsMCeJWEn President Trump is absolutely right. We have reached a crisis point and need to secure our border. The safety of the American people is worth fighting for. #TrumpAddress https://t.co/YC7qCbv3X3 Full interview: https://t.co/3tERSGqwNw We need to secure the border to: 
1. Stop the flow of drugs across the border that have perpetuated the devastating opioid crisis in our country.

https://t.co/y0ryk9fnNm https://t.co/rdYJPGiZ4R From my family to yours, #MerryChristmas! https://t.co/2YWCb2AYvs Democrats have said time and again that they are for ‚Äúborder security.‚Äù They should prove it by supporting a bill that will help secure our border, provide critical disaster relief funding, and keep our government open. The border wall will help stop the flow of illegal immigration that is hurting the economy &amp; endangering communities across the country. This funding bill reflects the priorities of not only #SC07, but the entire country. Securing our border is a matter of national security and a matter of life and death in the Seventh District. Law enforcement officers have attributed the 150 opioid overdoses in our district last year to drugs coming across our porous borders. Many of my constituents are still recovering from Hurricane Florence and this funding is critical to helping the Seventh District rebuild. I will continue to assess the unmet needs of our district and ensure we have the resources for a complete recovery. The House just advanced a spending bill that includes $7.8 billion for disaster relief and $5.7 billion to secure our border. Democrats claim to support border security, but it's just not true. Illegal immigration hurts our economy and the drugs flowing across our porous border are endangering communities across the country. Enough is enough. https://t.co/lyg2xGrsTX Read the full release: https://t.co/yfIBZ3DCM2 The House just passed a tax package that will build on the economic momentum that is creating new opportunities and lifting people up in #SC07 &amp; across the country.

Happy Holidays! https://t.co/4pkiAim5K1 The Farm Bill is a critical component of disaster recovery and will provide stability as our farmers continue to work, grow, and produce despite tough circumstance and unforeseen challenges. https://t.co/dDUOB4mt8J #SC07 farmers have dealt with more than their fair share of devastation, having to overcome 3 hurricanes in the last 4 years. After Florence, I joined farmers in our district to survey crop damage &amp; saw first-hand the additional challenges they face after a catastrophic event. Great news for South Carolina farmers, the #FarmBill is on the way to @POTUS‚Äôs desk! This legislation strengthens the farm safety net by expanding crop insurance, providing certainty for producers in the face of dropping farm income &amp; natural disasters. Great to see the Grand Strand continuing to grow and expand to new markets! Now, we are working on infrastructure to keep up with this growth and bring opportunity to all of #SC07.

https://t.co/qpwZ2Nhyhu The straightforward approach suggested by the Trump Administration will provide much needed certainty, return authority to state and local entities, and promote responsible management of our nation‚Äôs water and land in accordance with the Clean Water Act. Farmers were no longer able to plow their own land or became tied up in jurisdiction disputes that took years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve - it was the predictable result of such a massive government overreach. It was a power grab of epic proportions that subjected South Carolina farmers, landowners, and small businesses to onerous rules &amp; costly requirements. At the time, I heard concerns of many constituents whose fears turned into reality across the country. The @EPA and @USACEHQ proposed #WOTUS definition is welcome news in #SC07! President Obama's regulatory-happy EPA expanded the federal govt's regulatory authority from "main waterways" to all bodies of water, even on private property. I would like to thank Governor McMaster for his lifesaving actions during the storm and his commitment to the people of South Carolina during the recovery process. We will continue to work together to ensure a strong, complete recovery for our constituents. Additionally, I am glad the Governor has asked the South Carolina delegation to find a way to fund I-73 as an emergency evacuation route. Improving our outdated infrastructure is critical to enhancing our disaster preparedness. In #SC07, we are facing a long and costly recovery from Hurricane Florence. Governor McMaster‚Äôs request for additional CDBG-DR funding will ensure we can help as many people rebuild as possible. .@henrymcmaster sent me a letter that included an updated estimate for Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) funding. In the letter, Governor McMaster also called upon the South Carolina delegation to seek funding for I-73. Congratulations to the Myrtle Beach Seahawks on this well-deserved win!
