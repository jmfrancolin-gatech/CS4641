Let‚Äôs hope she and her party are willing keep their word and come to the negotiating table. (1/3) I appreciate that @POTUS was the first person to step forward and end this shutdown.

Nearly 90% of the Heroin that enters the U.S. comes from Mexico.

Democrats should #ComeToTheTable &amp; help our frontline of defense, @DEAHQ, @DHSgov, &amp; @CBP, block this drug from entering our country by #BuildingTheWall &amp; #SecuringOurBorder @HouseDemocrats must acknowledge a #BorderCrisis and #ComeToTheTable.

In the first two months of FY 2019, over 102,000 individuals have been apprehended so far. This is almost DOUBLE the apprehensions than the first two months of FY 2018. Between Fiscal Year 2017 and Fiscal Year 2018, @CBP reported that apprehensions along the Southwest Border increased by over 92,000 people.

This is a 30 percent increase.

America must #SecureTheBorder. In FY 2018, @CBP apprehended a total of 396,579 individuals attempting to illegally enter our country while thousands of legal immigrants are waiting on line for years to unite their families. #ThatIsWrong. We need Democrats to #ComeToTheTable and work toward solutions. @HouseDemocrats need to stop playing politics with much needed #BorderSecurity reforms and #ComeToTheTable to address the crisis at America‚Äôs southern border.

Best of luck and keep up the great work! The intent of Congress has been clear: no taxpayer dollars should support abortion‚Äîperiod.  It was clear when I voted to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion in the 2018 spending bill, and I‚Äôm pleased to see the @POTUS's decision today. #TitleX https://t.co/utAwUsvtmp Providing long-term certainty for Georgia's farmers is a priority ‚Äì and I‚Äôm proud to support this measure today. #2018FarmBill https://t.co/stL8wQD9Vw On Peace Officers Memorial Day, we‚Äôre reminded of the tremendous sacrifice made by so many in service to their neighbors. We‚Äôre forever grateful for these brave men and women, as well as their remarkable families. #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay #NationalPoliceWeek Pleased to see the @StateDept and @POTUS reach a resolution on #OpenSkies ‚Äì protecting American jobs from unfair foreign government practices such as issuing large subsidies to their own airlines.

Job openings hit a record high at 6.6M! #jobs #growth MORE: https://t.co/WiEdX53FLf Per @WSJ, "Unemployment in the U.S. fell in April to one of the lowest levels of the post-World War II era, the result of a historically long jobs expansion that shows little evidence of slowing." Can't think of more fitting news for the end of a great #SmallBusinessWeek. Tonight I'm in @PtreeCorners with the business association talking #TaxReform #Transportation and more. Thanks for your partnership &amp; for inviting me to be with you! #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/8855mSfRVl I recently had the pleasure of visiting with one of the many remarkable small businesses here in #GA07, which also happens to be the Small Manufacturer of the Year Award winner in Forsyth County!

This week I had the opportunity to share more about why I believe the #FairTax is the answer. @FairTaxOfficial https://t.co/U0yzcrowXq Headed to the @HouseFloor to talk #FairTax. #TaxDay may be behind us this year, but the #FairTaxMeansFreedom from it altogether. We can make it just another beautiful spring day. #HR25 #TaxDay is here again &amp; thankfully it is the last Tax Day under the old, broken tax code. That said, my ultimate goal is still to do away with Tax Day altogether, &amp; HR25, the #FairTax, does that. @FairTaxOfficial @TeamCavuto @Varneyco #TaxDay2018 https://t.co/MOSXk6kuXQ Great discussion. Thanks again, @ACEC_National @ACECGA #ACECAnnual2018 #Engineering #infrastructureinamerica https://t.co/CdWoRqHsBP RT @MichaelLSully: Looking forward to hearing from @RepRobWoodall this morning at the @ACEC_National 2018 Spring Conference. @ACECGA #gapol‚Ä¶ Grateful to @SenatorIsakson for his leadership and service. Looking forward to another successful Academy Day! https://t.co/q7AOS7rvXM As reported by the @WSJ &amp; according to the @USDOL, "The number of Americans claiming new unemployment benefits has never been so low for so long." Great progress, just getting started! https://t.co/wQGpYAIwb9 It was one of the darkest episodes in human history, and by remembering ‚Äì paying tribute to those lost and those who endured ‚Äì we help guard future generations from such tragedy. #HolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/sKmkMgcMyX Grateful for your service and friendship, @SpeakerRyan! Looking forward to continuing our work the remainder of this year. A 21st century #infrastructure system requires a streamlined, efficient regulatory process that no longer stands in the way of progress. Excited to see this Administration partnering with Congress to do just that. @WhiteHouse #infrastructureinamerica https://t.co/8YqkVfUy3L There are many important days on the calendar, but I can‚Äôt help but look forward to the renewal and hope that #Easter brings each year.

Thank you for your service and sacrifice to America! #NationalVietnamWarVeteransDay RT @HouseGOP: .@RepRobWoodall: We talk about tax reform as if it is a line item somewhere.

The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct was a great first step, and FairTax supporters continue to shape the ongoing tax reform conversation. #HR25 #TaxReform Headed to the House Floor to talk #TaxReform. We‚Äôve made great economic strides since passing the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, and I believe we‚Äôre just getting started. Rebuilding our outdated, over-capacity #infrastructure is going to require the kind of major reforms that we have laid out in the House @Transport Committee, and that the @POTUS has endorsed. #Transportation https://t.co/BpG3n2CUCc Great to have Transportation Secretary¬†Elaine¬†Chao join us on Capitol Hill today to further discuss the Administration‚Äôs infrastructure proposal! #Transportation #infrastructure @USDOT @WhiteHouse @Transport https://t.co/vEFBn9ZlLJ Congratulations to @We_Are_GSMST! Keep up the great work, and best of luck in the Finals! #NSB2018 https://t.co/b3NTvySJiv America's budgeting process is flawed, and hasn't been reformed in more than 4 decades, but we now have the opportunity to build the bipartisan, bicameral consensus to change that. #budget https://t.co/xU3fYSWvUt We have a real opportunity to make significant changes to America's #budget process, and I'm eager to continuing that work in this role. https://t.co/LMbB6YezOf Headed to the House Floor to share a bit about the ongoing #budgets and #spending discussion happening in Washington and across the country.

I hope you‚Äôll join me in urging the Senate to take up this common sense bill. Just voted to end the #SchumerShutdown. I was troubled and perplexed that Senate Dems would shut the govt down by opposing a funding bill that they actually support, all to convince the President to take up an issue he had already committed to taking up. https://t.co/qISC2zpYmy Proud to support House passage of #HR4712 today, moving us closer to our ultimate goal in the defense of life. #MarchforLife #MarchForLife2018 More good news for American workers and families in response to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct - and we're just getting started. #TaxReform @HouseGOP https://t.co/wkycXdEA20 ‚ÄúA genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus, but a molder of consensus.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. #MartinLutherKingJr  #MLKDay Happy #KoreanAmericanDay to everyone taking part in the celebration! #GA07 is blessed with a vibrant community!
