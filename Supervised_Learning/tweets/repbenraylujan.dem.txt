In New Mexico we know that water is life and most New Mexican communities rely on small water systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people each. Thank you to the New Mexico Rural Water Association for speaking with me about the water needs of small and rural communities. https://t.co/jaCw7AdUDq People in New Mexico and across the country are already experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change. The Trump administration's efforts to bury the facts puts the entire global community in jeopardy. #ActOnClimate #ClimateFriday If you’re experiencing difficulties with a federal agency, my staff are here to help. Stop by Le Farge Public Library in Santa Fe between 10 am and 12 pm to talk with a member of my staff. https://t.co/C3QAJ3XaS6 Democrats have been clear that we need to make modern, effective investments at our borders through technology at our ports of entry, filling Customs Officers vacancies, and providing basic supplies to agents on the ground. https://t.co/ayUyKsrLTn We will miss you, Chairman Dingell. To my friend @RepDebDingell- I am so sorry for your loss. Know that you are surrounded with love and prayers. John Dingell was a political giant and a friend to all. He was an incredible person, warm and thoughtful, who made the world a better place and truly embraced making a positive difference every day. When @AjitPaiFCC repealed #NetNeutrality rules, he promised it would revolutionize broadband access for rural Americans. That wasn't true. https://t.co/0I8iKfyStv It was a pleasure talking Medicaid Buy-in with you @morethanmySLE!

HR1 includes ethics reforms that will make government more transparent &amp; clean up corruption in Washington. Millions of Americans are at risk of being priced out of their health insurance if the Texas v. U.S. court case stands. Democrats want to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable and quality health care. #ProtectOurCare I'm grateful to my colleagues like @RepEscobar who represent districts along the Southern border for setting the record straight. https://t.co/8qplEWqtyk For too long, Congress responded to gun violence victims and their families with only thoughts and prayers. That era is over. Today, @HouseJudiciary held the first Congressional hearings on gun violence prevention in eight years. The U.S. is already seeing the impacts of extreme weather, including flooding, wildfires and drought. While Republican Congresses may have been in denial, Democrats will #ActOnClimate.

This historic legislation will return power back to the American people and end the culture of corruption in Washington. #SOTU We owe gun violence victims and their families more than just thoughts and prayers. That’s why this week, @HouseDemocrats will be holding the first Congressional hearings on gun violence prevention in eight years. #EndGunViolence #SOTU #SOTU2EndGunViolence No place of worship should ever again become the site of senseless gun violence. I join my Democratic colleagues, students, and the family and friends of victims in saying #NeverAgain. #EndGunViolence #SOTU #SOTU2EndGunViolence We must pursue peace through diplomacy whenever possible. President Trump has an obligation to work with our allies to form a clear strategy toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. #SOTU Women deserve the right to make their own healthcare decisions, no matter where they live or how much money they make. #SOTU I agree that Rx prices need to be reduced, but it’s hard to take POTUS seriously when he has sabotaged people’s health care for years - all efforts that would raise costs for American families. Learn about @HouseDemocrats plan to lower Rx costs here: https://t.co/PgBrjTCIdX #SOTU Tired of hearing POTUS talk about protecting people with preexisting conditions. It is time for Republicans to put up or shut up about protecting the health care of every American. Tune into @EnergyCommerce health hearing tomorrow to see if Rs are serious about change. #SOTU When it comes to infrastructure investments, the President can’t just talk the talk tonight, he needs to walk the walk. We need comprehensive investments in our roads, bridges, and broadband infrastructure to meet the demands of our 21st-century economy. #SOTU We must implement trade policies that protect American workers &amp; generate economic growth at home. It is critical that the President consider trade agreements &amp; policies that not only benefit workers and consumers, but also the environment. #SOTU New Mexico benefits from international trade when it strengthens our economy. We must continue to work towards policies that promote higher wages &amp; worker protections, fair labor &amp; environmental standards, increased opportunities for American workers &amp; greater economic growth. The #TrumpShutdown caused permanent damage to our economy. According to @USCBO, the President’s needless shutdown cost our economy $11 billion--$3 billion of which was lost forever. #SOTU The United States has always been a beacon to the rest of the world, offering refugees and asylum seekers safe haven. My guest tonight is an example of the power of hope. #SOTU @LIRSorg @LFSRM It’s unbelievable that President Trump continues to demand his 5th-century border wall. @HouseDemocrats support a modern and effective approach to border security, including investing in smart infrastructure and technology. #SOTU Despite the President’s inflammatory rhetoric, people coming to the United States seeking a better life are not a problem to be solved. Immigrants, refugees, and asylees make our communities more vibrant and our economy stronger. #SOTU The President has repeatedly chosen to stoke fear rather than come to the negotiating table to discuss the modern and effective border security strategies that Democrats have laid out. #SOTU President Trump's attempts to undercut the Special Counsel's investigation are unacceptable. Robert Mueller must be allowed to complete his work without obstruction. #SOTU @USCBO has projected economic growth this year to slow to 2.3% due to the #TrumpShutdown. Our economy should never have to pay the price for President Trump’s temper tantrums. #SOTU As Lead Case Worker for @lfsrm, Mungsan now uses his experience to help others who have come to our country seeking a new life. I’m honored to have Mungsan joining me this evening. #SOTU https://t.co/ohBGJUQtUK When the President looks into the House of Representatives gallery tonight, he will see Mungsan, a former refugee who now lives in New Mexico.

In the days ahead, we will discuss the modern and effective border security measures that Democrats have laid out. What is most important is that federal workers are going to get paid, services will resume, and local projects can proceed. There was no reason for the American people to suffer for 35 days.

But first, I urge the President to work with Congress on one of the options Democrats have put forward to open the government. Tonight, the President chose to stoke fear instead of restore certainty for the hundreds of thousands of families who do not know when their next paycheck will come. To govern based on the President’s tantrums is a disservice to the American people. It's long past time for Congress to take action to end this epidemic and start saving lives.

I join with @JoaquinCastrotx in calling for a full Congressional investigation. https://t.co/EObMibiADq Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from my family to yours. May your holiday season be filled with joy and blessings. RT @WhipHoyer: As a result of @RealDonaldTrump’s #TrumpShutdown, 800,000 federal employees across the nation are being furloughed or forced… President Trump has said over 25 times that he wanted a shutdown, which now comes while Republicans control the White House, the United States House, and the Senate. Democrats are ready to end this harmful #TrumpShutdown and get to work #ForThePeople. A #TrumpShutdown would be on the watch of a Republican Congress and a President who said himself he’d be proud to shut down our government. This is unnecessary, irresponsible, and not in the best interest of our country. The bipartisan #FirstStepAct that passed the House today makes much-needed reforms to America’s criminal justice system, including important improvements to address mass incarceration and mandatory minimums.

I know his leadership on behalf of the Kewa Pueblo will be deeply missed, and my prayers will continue to be with his family.

He was our friend; he was our brother. https://t.co/nfT2gybqAS Thank you to my colleagues @repmarkpocan, @RepStephenLynch, @RepBrendanBoyle, and @RepSchakowsky for co-sponsoring this legislation.
