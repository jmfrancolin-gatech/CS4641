Over the past week, I've traveled across #WI01 listening to folks in our communities and talking about the issues impacting us here in Southeast Wisconsin. Thanks to everyone for joining me at our listening sessions. Click below for a recap ⬇️
https://t.co/CmQLWSx8iC Thanks to everyone for joining tonight’s telephone town hall! Great questions. #WI01 https://t.co/sH7kd5n5eE RT @jessicatighe: Today I asked @RepBryanSteil if he thinks a deal will be made before the deadline for another #governmentshutdown. Here's… Great seeing Erin and Jenny from Janesville! Your work to prevent drug and substance abuse in our #WI01 community is important. Thanks for stopping by! https://t.co/N0PlZL7i4E Attention #WI01: For those who missed my 6 in-person listening sessions, this is your chance to ask me questions! Hope you can join me tonight for a telephone town hall! https://t.co/1e8U2wNZuh The president set forth an agenda that strengthens families and workers. There are clearly areas he discussed that both parties can work on to solve problems. I’m committed to cutting through the dysfunction in Washington and working with my colleagues to get results. #SOTU “'My goal is to be as accessible as I can,’” Steil said. “‘I love hearing what people’s thoughts are on policies...I’m one month in, so I’m learning. What I want to be is your voice in Washington. To do that, I need to listen.'"

A great tradition of honoring the unsung heroes in Racine who are working to improve our community. https://t.co/pEd0wTCUZK Well, the news today is promising. An early spring would be nice for us in Southeast Wisconsin after this week’s polar vortex! Happy #GroundhogDay! Another great listening session this afternoon. Thanks to all for joining me in Mount Pleasant for our Racine County listening session! #WI01 https://t.co/EcinZRtZOS Thanks to everyone who came out in Milwaukee County.

Next stop ➡️ Milwaukee County. #WI01 https://t.co/KFfhQClpKc My @FinancialCmte subcommittee assignments will allow me to focus on helping families achieve financial stability. We also must ensure our community, including rural and city neighborhoods, have the ability to attract investment &amp; create good paying jobs. https://t.co/xdN4IgVHYv Joining @WTMJSteve on @620wtmj around 8:45 CT. Tune in! My view during our first @FinancialCmte meeting. https://t.co/sbpkH1XLFl Attention all in #WI01: I'm hosting listening sessions on Friday, Feb. 1 and Monday, Feb. 4—one in each county. Below you will find information on dates, times, and locations. I hope you will join me! https://t.co/ZXCBaTufLk Thanks to Brett from the Muskego-Norway School Board for visiting the office today! Enjoyed talking about the importance of education in our community. #WI01 https://t.co/M5fOJ11iby Great meeting with @BurlingtonWI Mayor Jeannie Hefty this weekend. Thanks, Mayor Hefty for your leadership in #WI01! https://t.co/0tr6rAkGAD About to join Tim Bremel on “Your Talk Show” on @wclo1230. Tune in! Congrats to @MuskegoHSFB Coach Ken Krause. Ken was nominated by the @packers for the Don Shula Award. Ken led the Warriors to its first state championship title! He’s a leader and dedicated to his players and #WI01 community. Good luck! I’ll watch for you during the #ProBowl! Today we remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and thank the heroes, our WWII veterans, who risked their lives to defeat Nazism. Let us honor the lives of those we lost and remain vigilant against all forms of evil and anti-semitism. #WeRemember https://t.co/krXY0cjT0q Great meeting with @Kenosha_Sheriff David Beth. Looking forward to working with him to keep our community safe. https://t.co/796aMDFcu1 Happy birthday to a legend, Bob Uecker! https://t.co/5v5S0m9N4R I caught up with State Rep. @samanthakerkman at the 75th Street Inn. Enjoyed our discussion on how to expand opportunities for families and workers in Kenosha County! https://t.co/mlsb8ANtHl Now that we have a deal, let’s get to work on a permanent solution to fund the government and secure our border. Today, I grabbed coffee with a local mother whose daughter serves in the Coast Guard. Her story is like many others throughout the country right now. We must do our jobs, find common ground, and end this shutdown. https://t.co/ORmrax7NRp Hitting the road this morning for a busy day in #WI01...I knew it was cold...I didn’t think it was THAT cold! https://t.co/z6B7vqAzTg A couple of things...

1- Today’s vote in the House was more political theater, not a solution to end the shutdown
2- We should be in D.C. tomorrow and every day until we reopen the government

Let’s do our jobs, stay in D.C., and end this shutdown! The Coast Guard's commitment to serving our country is admirable. Many are reporting to duty, without pay, to protect our nation. The shutdown should've ended 34 days ago, but if it lasts a day longer, we must pass this bill today so @USCG can receive pay. https://t.co/cpjGLB31m0 Every child should have the opportunity to attend a school that is best for them. In fact, 81,000 students in Wisconsin attend a private voucher or a charter school. #SchoolChoice https://t.co/qnbQCKqiQx Welcome home and thank you for your service! #WisconsinNationalGuard https://t.co/ikzV4MMq5y Juvenile diabetes impacts thousands of families across Wisconsin and the nation. I recently met with #WI01 @JDRF advocates in our Janesville Constituent Services Center. Thanks for sharing your stories with me and for your continued advocacy. https://t.co/o2Hxz7iU6q From @WKOW this weekend: I held swearing-in ceremonies in Janesville and Racine. In Congress, I’m committed to getting results for Southeast Wisconsin families, workers, and students. #WI01 https://t.co/kEDPicAeb5 Happy National #SchoolChoice week! Did you know Wisconsin is home to the nation’s oldest private voucher program in the nation? 

(Courtesy of @WILawLiberty) https://t.co/qryiRogNDr Yesterday I toured Kinetic in Greendale. It’s critical that Southeast Wisconsin workers have access to quality, affordable education so they can be prepared for jobs of the future. Closing the skills gap will result in higher wages for workers in #WI01! https://t.co/rJtcjVlpnx Attended today’s One Voice, Many Stories #MLKDay celebration at @gatewaytech in Kenosha. Great to honor those in Southeast Wisconsin who continue to inspire and embody MLK’s spirit. 

“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” -MLK https://t.co/YbkmmfXwLX Today we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. I joined the Southeastern Wisconsin Baptist Pastors Fellowship for their Dr. King’s Celebration event on Friday—a great evening. We should all strive to incorporate MLK’s teachings into our daily lives and communities. #MLKDay https://t.co/DjLuMQ4DjG Thanks to everyone who came out to today’s swearing-in ceremonies in Racine and Janesville! Special thanks to Judges Boyle and Werner for administering the oath of office. It’s a great honor to serve the people of Southeast Wisconsin. #WI01 https://t.co/aZALC48ShG Today, President Trump offered a path to end the shutdown. Now it is time for Senate Democrats and Nancy Pelosi to display a similar willingness to compromise and finally bring an end to this impasse. I'm hopeful that with the president’s offer, real progress is finally possible. Huge win!!! #OnWisconsin https://t.co/HtohR93QPJ Enjoyed meeting with @WaukeshaSheriff Eric Severson. Thanks to Sheriff Severson and all of our Waukesha law enforcement officers for their service and for protecting our community. https://t.co/9Ol9AbFuXj Another great Friday night Fish Fry! Thanks to St. Thomas Aquinas in Waterford for having me. #WI01 https://t.co/bz8aGde575 Today I met with @RacinePD Chief Art Howell. Thank you for your service and I look forward to partnering with the Racine Police Department to keep our community safe. https://t.co/yAgExDxtKw RT @RacineCounty: Thanks for meeting with us, @RepBryanSteil. Excited to work together to help Racine County residents and businesses. http… Great meeting with you, @WaukeshaCoExec. Looking forward to working together to support and grow our community! #WI01 https://t.co/7884BD1RSm ICYMI listen to yesterday's interview with @WTMJSteve on @620wtmj here: https://t.co/ZHtpL8hYjE https://t.co/ho213zE733 The government is still shut down, yet Speaker Pelosi just sent everyone home until Tuesday. We should be here working every day until we get the job done. Let’s get to work! https://t.co/k898H9nCA0 Joining @WTMJSteve on @620wtmj at 8:45am CST. Tune in! In the private sector, you don’t leave until the job is done. I’m ready to stay here until we get the job done. Let’s get to work. https://t.co/9dm9eofvOY About to join Tim Bremel on “Your Talk Show” on @wclo1230. Tune in! Whether you are buying a home, starting a small business, or receiving financial aid, financial services play an important role in #WI01. As a member on @FinancialCmte, I will work to ensure the American dream is within everyone's reach. https://t.co/rFls9n973n Attention #WI01 students: Our Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. offices are looking for interns! This is a great opportunity to learn more about the legislative process. If you or someone you know would be interested in applying, please visit my website: https://t.co/y8euqJo4mF https://t.co/sHt8ThWEdg ICYMI: I joined @DanODonnellShow on @newstalk1130 to discuss the government shutdown. These political games and dysfunction would never fly in the private sector. Let's get to work. https://t.co/nl1Ov1N0co There’s nothing better than a #WI01 Friday night Fish Fry! Thanks to St. Theresa Church in Eagle for the great company and delicious food. https://t.co/WMY83t85pv I spent this morning at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church’s 28th annual MLK prayer breakfast in Racine. Great to join our community in prayer and celebrate the life and teachings of MLK. https://t.co/GUnuf2NAR0 At a Kwik Trip in Mount Pleasant celebrating #NationalMilkDay! Did you know that the Wisconsin dairy industry contributes more than $43 billion to our state’s economy? Thanks to those in our dairy industry for their hard work! 🐄🥛 https://t.co/wwxQb1eYBz In the private sector, you never stop working until the job is done. Why isn’t this true in Washington? Disappointed that Speaker Pelosi adjourned the House for the weekend in the midst of a government shutdown. We need to solve this now! I’m joining the @DanODonnellShow on @newstalk1130 at 10:30CST. Tune in! Great meeting with #WI01 advocates from the Littlest Tumor Foundation. They are in Washington bringing awareness to Neurofibromatosis, a genetic, tumor-generating disorder. Your advocacy is important and thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. https://t.co/AkTZsK90HW Thank you to all of our law enforcement officers in #WI01 and throughout the country for protecting our communities every day. Your sacrifices and call to serve do not go unnoticed. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/4Asl04tkvA I am in Congress to work with anyone to get the job done and solve these problems, not to play political games with our border security and government funding. We must secure our border and end the shutdown. https://t.co/3Jkx4xhEmE Joining @WTMJSteve on @620wtmj at 9:07CST. Tune in! Our office is open! If you need help with a federal agency or want to share your opinion on federal policy, please contact me here: https://t.co/qzJy64slSh https://t.co/Ks8VvZry5Y I am committed to finding a solution, ending the shutdown, and providing necessary funding for enhanced border security. We must be productive and offer serious proposals.

I came here to solve the tough issues and get results for Southeast Wisconsin. It’s time to get to work. #WI01 https://t.co/NMtoKYUIZ5 My statement on the government shutdown and last night’s votes: https://t.co/tFQ5bYRiPr I used my 101-year-old grandma’s bible for the swearing-in. Great to have my family here with me today. Let’s get to work. https://t.co/pSV7RDOtoA I was just officially sworn in as #WI01’s representative. I'm ready to work with my House colleagues to address the issues impacting our community: lowering health care costs, increasing access to affordable education, and preparing today's workforce for tomorrow's jobs. https://t.co/EqxHZ2k4R9 Busy morning getting the office up and running and preparing for the new Congress. I picked up my official voting card—I’ll use it each time I cast a vote on the House floor. https://t.co/oBzy9IwrXZ Today I’ll be sworn in as #WI01’s representative for the 116th Congress. Looking forward to getting to work on behalf of the people of Southeast Wisconsin! https://t.co/OrwRCSaXVq
