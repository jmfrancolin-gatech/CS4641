We must stand up against a radical agenda that would legalize infanticide. We must protect the rights of all babies. This is not a partisan issue. It is simply what’s right. https://t.co/jybZfQjw9G Sadly, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is needed more than ever with the passage of a radical law in New York state that essentially legalizes infanticide. https://t.co/0remgJU8fY The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require doctors to provide medical care to children who survive an abortion attempt. I urge the Speaker to schedule a vote as soon as possible. https://t.co/0remgJCwRo Just spoke on the House floor to call for a vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a vital bill to prohibit infanticide.

(3/5) We need to work together to keep our economic momentum going, allow our manufacturers and farmers to succeed, and make sure hardworking Hoosiers have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. (2/5) President Trump spoke to the American people with clarity, a call for unity, and a renewed commitment to our shared ideals. (1/5) Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and a human rights violator. @POTUS is right to stand strong against this rogue regime. #SOTU ISIS is weakened, but it remains a serious threat to our national security and our allies. We must continue to fight these terrorists until we defeat ISIS once and for all. #SOTU Maximum pressure brought North Korea to the table. Now we need to remember President Reagan’s advice: trust, but verify. #SOTU America stands with our NATO allies in the face of threats and destabilizing actions from countries like Russia. #SOTU I stand with @POTUS in defense of the sanctity of life. Every life, born or unborn, is precious and deserves respect. #SOTU #prolife I support protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. No one should lose coverage or face higher premiums due to health status. #SOTU America needs a 21st century infrastructure to keep our economy going strong. I look forward to working with @POTUS to achieve this important goal. #SOTU U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is good news for American manufacturers, farmers, and workers – but it’s time to remove steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliation. #SOTU I applaud @POTUS for bringing China to the table, and I’m hopeful these talks will lead to an agreement that levels the playing field and holds China accountable. #SOTU .@POTUS is right to go after China’s unfair trade practices, but we need to be careful not to harm American manufacturers and farmers in the process. #SOTU .@POTUS is right: we must fix our immigration system and secure our borders. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will support commonsense border security measures. #SOTU Our veterans risked their lives for our freedom, and I’m committed to making sure they get the services, benefits, and care they earned. #SOTU Because of historic tax cuts and regulatory reforms, our economy is growing. We need to work together to keep that momentum going. #SOTU Hardworking Hoosiers are seeing more job opportunities and higher wages because of tax cuts and regulatory reforms. The American Dream is alive and well. #SOTU RT @Marketplace: .@RepWalorski talked to @kairyssdal about her efforts to keep American business informed on the tariff exemption process:… RT @WNDU: An Army veteran from Culver has finally reunited with Tess, his soldier dog that searched for bombs during their deployment to Af… Last year, I got a remarkable letter from a veteran’s wife asking for help.
