We need a safe, lawful immigration system that secures the border and eliminates bad policies that encourage the breaking of our laws. Our current immigration policies incentivize cartels and migrants to game the system. It must be fixed! https://t.co/1XDk5RQS5M My response to the Democrats' radical and socialistic #GreenNewDeal , which promises "a massive transformation of our society" by providing "economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work": https://t.co/PCRdwGN4Gf We join @NASA in remembering the crews of Apollo 1 (Jan 27, 1967), Challenger (Jan 28, 1986), and Columbia (Feb 1, 2003) who were lost while pushing the boundaries of space exploration.

I stand w @SteveScalise &amp; @RepAnnWagner in forcing vote to ban. As Rep. Wagner said, “this is the simplest vote you will ever take: either you support babies being killed after they are born or you don’t.” RT @housesciencegop: Welcome @RepBrianBabin back to the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics as Ranking Member! https://t.co/49p0AsYmDz RT @juliegraceb: Scalise, Wagner plan to introduce discharge petition for abortion bill https://t.co/00NgCmjqUa In tonight’s #SOTU, @POTUS discussed the progress weve made in 2 short years &amp; the challenges ahead we can overcome by “Choosing Greatness”. He laid out a plan to protect America’s workforce, strengthen national security, &amp; revive our aging infrastructure. https://t.co/9jn6Qwrg9a RT @TheRealBuzz: Proud to serve! #USA https://t.co/aXAOaWAz2D “America is born free and we will stay free.” “America will never be a socialist country.” The American people stand firmly with @POTUS in condemning a system that has oppressed millions. Our government should protect our God-given rights, not subjugate us. #SOTU It’s amazing at the progress we have made in two years in curbing North Korea’s nuclear program. Much work remains, but excellent job so far by @POTUS. #SOTU https://t.co/VYSY9BpV0N @POTUS wants paid family leave so every family can bond with their newborn child. What a contrast with radical abortion policies of NY and VA Democrats! Thank you Mr. President for calling to end partial birth abortions. This will forever be a stain on our nation’s history. #SOTU I’m glad @POTUS and @GOP remain firmly committed to protect those with pre-existing conditions. As a health care provider, I know how important this is to patients. But we need more free market solutions to bring down costs and expand treatment optional. #SOTU “The border agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way way down.” This is a commonsense principal most Dems agreed with before @POTUS was elected. #buildthebarrier #SOTU “Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate. It’s actually very cruel.” @POTUS is right - we must enforce a legal immigration system to end violent coyote and gang exploitation of migrants and protect our own citizens. #SOTU “It’s time for Congress to show America is committed to ending illegal immigration.” @POTUS and the American people know border security is national security. 10 days left for Dems to compromise. Let’s get it done! #SOTU “The US is now the #1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world” and “a net exporter of energy.” @POTUS I’m proud that Houston, TX is the energy capital of the US! #SOTU It’s great to see @POTUS recognize @TheRealBuzz at #SOTU. As the top Republican on @housesciencegop the past two Congresses, I’ve benefited greatly from Buzz Aldrin’s friendship and wise counsel. Dems, there's a simple solution to avoid emergency declaration - come to the negotiating table! We're asking for $5.7 billion out of a $trillion plus budget - less than 1/10 of 1%. How can you say this is money you can't find? This is national security! https://t.co/fV4XCG4EoB RT @EveningEdit: .@RepBrianBabin on #border: "I wish the #Democrats would go down to the border and see what I've seen." @FoxBusiness @LizM… I’ll be live momentarily on @EveningEdit on @FoxBusiness to discuss #SOTU and border security. I hope you can tune in! Last week, w/ bipartisan support in the House &amp; Senate, I reintroduced the TAPS Act. I cannot thank Greg enough for his service to our country &amp; for his help on the TAPS Act, &amp; I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill passed. https://t.co/i3zPgWizXx I am proud that Greg Glod will be my guest at #SOTU. Greg served 26 years in Secret Service &amp; is an expert in threat assessment. After the Parkland tragedy, Greg contacted me w/ a plan to prevent attacks in our schools and communities which led to my introduction of the TAPS Act. 6) Revitalizing American space program: @POTUS has sought renewed mission for @NASA &amp; space program. @NASA_Johnson Space Center will play vital role in US reclaiming sole leadership in space exploration. We want to return to the moon - to stay - and go to Mars. @housesciencegop 5) Rebuilding American infrastructure: @POTUS wants to continue rebuilding infrastructure to move people &amp; goods. On @TransportGOP Cmte we want to work with Dems on highway bill, but some freshman Dems say no bill without unrelated climate change provisions. Let's be bipartisan! 4) Protecting American workers: strong workforce is crucial for continued economic growth. @GOP plan: empower individuals &amp; businesses to boost wages. We've sent msg we'll protect our trade interests. Dems push policies to hollow out workforce, increase federal dependence. 3) Healthcare &amp; prescriptions: @GOPHouse passed reforms last year to lower prescription drug prices for Americans needing medical care. Dems have refused to replace/improve Obamacare even as healthcare costs ⬆️ &amp; options ⬇️. Will #SOTU present next steps? Dems, come to the table! 2) National security: @POTUS is pursuing foreign policy that protects Americans and our interests 1st &amp; foremost. How will we continue pursuing our long-term interests while honoring commitments &amp; protecting allies? We've made progress in Afghanistan, Venezuela &amp; North Korea. 1) Border security &amp; immigration: This affects every congressional district in the US - critically important! We need immigration policies that benefit American people's interest. It all starts with securing border. @POTUS has been willing to compromise but so far Dems have not. I'm excited @POTUS will speak about "Choosing Greatness" in tonight's #SOTU. Our economy is strong, but we can do so much more if we decide to come together and advance an agenda in the best interests of the American people. Here are some issues I hope to see him address tonight: Thank you @ndaajustice ! The TAPS Act has been a priority for me since introducing it last year, &amp; I'm excited to have bipartisan support in both the House &amp; Senate this year. We will work hard to get this bill passed so we can prevent violence against innocent people.

Not only has Democratic leadership REFUSED to negotiate to end shutdown, but now their entire caucus has voted TWICE against paying federal workers. @POTUS has offered compromise plan. Republicans in House &amp; Senate are ready to negotiate. Nancy? Come to the table! Let's end this! https://t.co/g33bv4tBV1 I had to double take when I saw this. Chuck &amp; Nancy have insisted for weeks Dems won’t negotiate, but I'm hopeful internal pressure on Dem leadership will lead them to the table. We have to compromise to secure our border &amp; get everyone back to work! https://t.co/GJbKFqSubJ Sadly, today marks the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision. I join Americans across the country in mourning the millions of innocent lives we have lost in the years since. We must give voice to the voiceless and defend the unborn. Today we reflect upon the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He believed strongly that all men are created equal and should receive equal justice under the law. Let’s always remember his message. Pelosi keeps House in session 4 more show votes but wont even be here?!

We must secure our borders. American lives and sovereignty are at risk. https://t.co/xbvTmmSHO2 The President is willing to negotiate and compromise to find a path forward to protect our citizens and open our government.  Why won't Democrats come to the table?  This is political theater, pure and simple. https://t.co/x9w2OSttBB I spoke on the House floor last week about the ongoing crisis our nation is facing at the border, which I have seen with my own eyes. I made a promise to my constituents and the American people to secure our southern border, and I intend to keep that promise. https://t.co/JLU5HofuIu RT @GOP: There is a national security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border and it is only worsening.
 
Tell Democrats to work wit… Yesterday, I joined Cavuto on Fox Business to say that the shutdown could be fixed in 15 minutes if Dems would come to the table. We also discussed the importance of funding increased border security, including a barrier, before opening the gov't again. https://t.co/Ut6lTpLl6N House Dems are introducing spending bills that 1) Senate won't take up &amp; 2) Pres. won't sign. Instead of negotiating, they're playing political games w/ worthless "messaging" votes on bills they know will go nowhere! Where is a serious proposal? Let's compromise &amp; open the gov't. @marinasidesteve @HouseGOP offer solutions, not rhetoric. Rhetoric is @HouseDemocrats claiming they support border security while advocating for sanctuary cities, mass amnesty and abolishing ICE. I agree we need vast improvements to our immigration policy and I will continue advocating for that. @DorothyHagan I made the decision to forgo my pay during the shutdown. I know shutdowns are hard for many, which is why I voted to fully fund the gov't Dec 21. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats blocked that bill from even receiving a vote, which led to the shutdown. https://t.co/U38LMOCHqF @meliss_a Just to be clear, that is a quote directly from @BarackObama, who clearly believed immigrants pour into the country. https://t.co/iF6p1T8R43 Democrats say over and over “of course we want border security” but offer no solutions other than abolishing ICE, creating Sanctuary Cities and offering mass amnesty. It doesn’t add up! https://t.co/Nmogq6pgbY We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.

I returned from our Southern border yesterday after meeting face to face with border agents and American citizens closely affected by our border crisis. They made clear to me: improved border security is a must, and wall funding must be a critical component. #BuildTheWall https://t.co/9mL7jzKLEX I’ve officially signed my oath of office for the 116th Congress and am ready to get back to work to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. https://t.co/aMJ9iYnW6Q This is why I’m fighting to secure our border.
