That is why I'm urging my colleagues to support my legislation that will help provide supportive mental health services to our military heroes fighting invisible injuries. #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek RT @USTravel: "Renewing @BrandUSA long-term is important for the economy, as well as the perfect opportunity for bipartisan cooperation." -… Pleased to announce that @UMCSN and the #SouthernNevada Health District have been awarded a total of $300,000 from @HHSGov. Pleased to see the Chinese-American World War II Veteran Congressional Gold Medal Act, a bill I cosponsored, pass the Senate. It's important to honor the dedication of Chinese-Americans veterans who sacrificed for our nation at a time when their service went unrecognized by many. Congratulations to @Fly_Flirtey &amp; @CityofReno on conducting their first multi-drone delivery demonstration under the @FAANews Drone Integration Pilot Program! This partnership will not only advance drone technology, it will help save lives.

funds for 4 #NV military construction projects &amp; my provisions to support our veterans &amp; strengthen water security: https://t.co/sEHqAHP38i That’s why I’m pressing VA Secretary Wilkie to reconsider his position &amp; support legislation I’m pushing to extend disability benefits to our Blue Water veterans for medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. Learn more: https://t.co/iepoijLOCF The cost of providing the care and benefits we owe to our veterans for their service &amp; sacrifices should not be part of any reasoning to reject legislation that extends disability benefits to our Blue Water Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Read @RoyBlunt and my piece in @thehill to learn why we're leading the charge in Congress to renew #BrandUSA, a program that encourages travelers from around the world to visit the U.S.: https://t.co/KuH1GZypvW As a Northern Nevadan myself, I realize how important Truckee Meadows Flood Control Project is for our community, which is why I worked to secure the $181 million in funding it was promised in the reconciled water infrastructure legislation. Read more: https://t.co/V2IXdWpkw5 Pleased to announce @NSF has awarded @UNLV ‘s Lean Entrepreneurship Advancement Program (LEAP) over $150,000. Over $2.7 million has been awarded to the state of #Nevada to help address substance abuse in communities throughout the state. As an advocate for efforts that combat the opioid crisis and increase patient access to treatment, I welcome this announcement. As wildfires continue to devastate land throughout Nevada, I welcome the recent announcement from @NSF that the @unevadareno has been awarded $684,689 in funding to continue collaborative research on wildfire smoke &amp; air quality safety. More here: https://t.co/wiyJV7Bp1g Encouraged to see my provision to ensure funding for the #TruckeeMeadows Flood Control Project is preserved in the most recent water infrastructure legislation agreed to by leaders of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Today, we reflect on the thousands of innocent lives that were lost, &amp; we are reminded of the immeasurable acts of selflessness and bravery that followed the 9/11 attacks. On this day in particular, we are reminded of the resilience of our United States. https://t.co/hdNPCxsdcC Not only did I work to keep #YuccaMountain out of the legislation released today, this bill also funds 4 military projects in #NV and it includes my provisions to support our #veterans and strengthen our water security. Learn more here: https://t.co/PtB2eawpPt My office greeted #NV veterans returning home from the #HonorFlight trip to Washington D.C. where they had the chance to visit the national memorials that commemorate the war, or wars, they served in. Thank you to all of Nevada's  veterans for your service and sacrifice. https://t.co/yntn6DuGFS Once again, the U.S. House of Representatives has failed in its relentless pursuit to turn #NV into our nation’s nuclear waste dump. Read about my work to keep funding to revive #YuccaMountain out of the reconciled appropriations bill released today: https://t.co/zGY2NtErRW I cosponsored the #STARAct to accelerate pediatric cancer research &amp; provide resources to young patients. It's a positive step toward supporting survivors &amp; helping our nation’s top disease fighters develop treatments to save young lives. Learn more here: https://t.co/M6KnS9QnQy September is #ChildhoodCancerAwarenessMonth, and this year, I'm encouraged that it follows the passage of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act, bipartisan legislation that I was proud to help navigate into law. Having supported legislation that helps expand access to mental health &amp; substance use disorder services, I welcome @HHSGov award of $2 million to Vitality Unlimited, a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic, which will go a long way toward helping patients in #NV. In light of #Nevada’s devastating fire season, I joined fellow members of the U.S. Senate Western Caucus to urge robust forest management reforms to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Watch @8NewsNow coverage of our effort, and learn more here: https://t.co/NnUFec1iGr https://t.co/2ugaLwX96J Happy #RoshHashanah to all of those across #Nevada who are celebrating the New Year! #NV is still recovering from the #MartinFire, which dealt a devastating blow to ranchers who lost their property, cattle, &amp; grazing allotments. That's why I thank @SecretarySonny for @USDA decision I announced earlier today. More here: https://t.co/tH1z9WBvmd Read more about my visit with @VP, @DeptVetAffairs Acting Deputy Secretary James Byrne, airmen @NellisAFB, and their families here: https://t.co/7MlYZvqimA Great visiting with veterans and members of our Armed Forces at @NellisAFB today. Thank you to all in #Nevada and across the country who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms. https://t.co/Gy8smu60jy It was an honor to introduce our @VP today at @NellisAFB and reaffirm our support to our nation’s active service members, our veterans, and their families. Thank you, Vice President Pence, for making another trip to #Nevada. (Official White House Photo by Allaina Parton) https://t.co/oCRWxZbmPb Proud to welcome @VP back to #Nevada today to meet with service members at @NellisAFB. Always good to catch up w/@jgillanNews3LV. We talked about the message I sent to DOE yesterday: storing weapons-grade plutonium outside of #LasVegas could threaten the health &amp; safety of Nevadans &amp; have a devastating impact on our economy. More here: https://t.co/PD806q7RsJ https://t.co/L3LU5KaI4b I welcome the announcement from @SecretarySonny that he has declared #HumboldtCounty a disaster area due to wildfires in the region. This opens up additional resources for #NV ranchers and farmers who have lost so much to these blazes. Thank you to the students with the Close Up Foundation in #LasVegas for asking thoughtful questions during our visit yesterday. Always great to see young people engaged and interested in the legislative process. https://t.co/iJbDpbCoRr Great to see Rosemary Vassiliadis, the Director of Aviation @LASairport, to discuss the airport's continual growth &amp; how we can work together to promote more domestic and international tourism to NV and support the tens of millions of visitors who travel to #LasVegas each year. https://t.co/1jrmlLHYe2 That’s why I’m strongly opposed to this proposal and am pressing DOE to conduct a full environmental impact analysis before moving forward with any further action. Read more here: https://t.co/X84rnvdR2k Not only does shipping up to one metric ton of plutonium across the country likely present risks to those living along the proposed transportation routes, storing this material just a few miles from #LasVegas could threaten the health &amp; safety of Nevadans &amp; our tourism economy. DOE should not move forward with its proposal to store weapons-grade plutonium in #Nevada before fully evaluating the health, safety, and environmental impact that it would have on our state. Thank you to Larissa and Kristen who traveled from #Nevada with the American Organization of #Nurse Executives to speak with me about nursing workforce development programs &amp; patient access to care. I appreciate your work on behalf of the well-being of Nevadans! https://t.co/Xj48TeCMBV Had a productive discussion about immigration reform with Pratik from #Henderson, Jay from #Reno, and others with @immivoice. https://t.co/j43qB26K0u Excited to announce that @unevadareno has been awarded $340,000 through @NSF’s National Robotics Initiative to improve robotic grippers. #Robotics technology is transforming manufacturing, creating stronger prosthetics for our #veterans, &amp; even encouraging space exploration. Thanks to everyone in #Washoe for participating in tonight's telephone town hall meeting. I was encouraged to see my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives speak in support of our bill, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act Reauthorization, this evening. I will continue working on both sides of the aisle to move #FVPSA through Congress. Proud to report that the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Know the Lowest Price Act, a bipartisan bill that I co-sponsored to help save Nevadans money by banning a practice that has led to too many patients overpaying for their medications. More here: https://t.co/dJ5fPMFfPO Today, I joined the @SenWestCaucus in urging robust forest management reforms, which I believe will help reduce the risk &amp; severity of devastating #wildfires in #NV. Learn more here: https://t.co/NnUFec1iGr Proud to see my bipartisan legislation, the Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, pass the U.S. House of Representatives. Students deserve the opportunity to make well-informed financial decisions as they pursue higher education. My legislation offers an effective partnership between veterans &amp; STEM career opportunities in #Nevada, &amp; as a senior member of @VAChair, I look forward to working w/ my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to send it to the President's desk. Read more: https://t.co/XOYCmbXA0q With the influx of drones, autonomous &amp; electric vehicles &amp; other tech companies in #NV, there is a high demand for STEM specific job requirements. That’s why I was proud to see my legislation – the Supporting Veterans in #STEM Careers Act - pass out of @SenateCommerce today. Before heading to a @VAChair hearing this afternoon, I had the chance to take questions from Nevadans throughout #ClarkCounty during our telephone town hall meeting. https://t.co/Izg9xdroW6 Great to see that @unevadareno has been awarded $1mil from @usnistgov for its Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center, which works to ensure #NV's manufacturing sector continues to thrive &amp; create more competitive jobs. Learn more about the Center: https://t.co/FFLcbLZg7N Pleased to announce that Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe Fire Rescue &amp; Las Vegas Fire &amp; Rescue will be awarded grants totaling over $2.9 million through the competitive SAFER program, which helps departments hire more frontline firefighters who bravely protect our #NV communities. Thanks to everyone in #ClarkCounty who joined tonight’s telephone town hall meeting. Look forward to the next one. Happy #LaborDay, Nevada! Thank you to all of the hardworking men and women throughout our great state, which is now one of the fastest growing states in the country. https://t.co/mUwzKAV60B Following Nevada’s recent denied request to help fight the #SouthSugarloafFire, I am urging @FEMA to reconsider criteria required to qualify for wildfire assistance grants in order to level the playing field for rural #Nevada. Learn more: https://t.co/KRifzHtYng I was honored to attend the memorial service honoring the life of Sen. John McCain in Phoenix this morning. This country has lost an American war hero, and a fierce advocate for our veterans and all of those who serve. He will truly be missed. In NV, more than 1,300 veterans are homeless. Arnold Stalk of @VetsVillageLV is a tireless advocate for Nevada's veterans, and we share the same mission of making sure that no veteran is forced to sleep on the streets. Learn more about our discussion here: https://t.co/6bKjSWZOyu As the #SouthSugarloafFire continues to burn, I ask all Nevadans in Elko County to pay close attention to evacuation notices &amp; advisories. Thank you to the brave firefighters who are battling this &amp; other wildfires throughout #NV. I will continue to monitor the situation closely. https://t.co/43EvciLZlZ No words to describe the loss of Senator John McCain, a man I’ve had the honor of serving with in the U.S. Senate. Our country has lost an American war hero and statesman. Lynne and I are praying for Cindy and the entire McCain family. Caught up with #Reno media today about my work to combat Nevada's backlog of untested sexual assault kits and the Senate's action to confirm more judges to the federal bench. https://t.co/bhC6bJd1XO Joined my colleagues to introduce the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, a bill that would guarantee Nevadans have equal health care coverage, regardless of their health status or pre-existing conditions. Read about it here: https://t.co/2E4psClkgu Visited @WashoeCoSheriff office earlier today &amp; discussed #Nevada’s progress toward reducing the number of untested sexual assault kits. I’m committed to doing everything I can to secure more federal resources for this division &amp; all labs in NV. More here: https://t.co/zlVsUkHRsX This year, DHS acted on my request to change the formula used to determine the UASI grant money that #LasVegas receives. The result? Las Vegas was awarded an additional $2.13 million in UASI funding compared to last year. https://t.co/68M4yJNsVa DHS notified Congress in May that #LasVegas will receive $5 million from the UASI program to help protect against attacks. For years, I've pushed DHS to change the formula used to determine UASI grant $ to accurately reflect the needs of Las Vegas. https://t.co/VFrKEx2Vut
