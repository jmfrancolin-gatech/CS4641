It's time for the leaders of both parties to come together, shut the door &amp; hammer out a win-win deal that breaks this gridlock. https://t.co/WMV3BU2S0S @vince_powers ...and to negotiate in good faith. Compromise takes both sides, and Pelosi said “not a single dollar” before and after shutdown, and promised the same if govt is reopened. This gridlock is about her zero compromise. @jenndreibel @GOP I ran and won on clear principles and platform. I keep promises. Our condolences to the families of the 4 beloved Americans killed. ISIS has lost the territory it once held in Iraq &amp; Syria, but is underground &amp; still capable of conducting terror strikes. We can’t let them regroup where they can once again pose a threat. https://t.co/UMv2W9D3QX @ZevRohloff @justinkemerling We support additional vehicle screen devices. Our CBP requests a physical barrier in key portions of our border. And... much less than what Schumer requested just a few years ago. @justinkemerling You mean the one that Schumer supported but three times larger than Trump’s request? @RollanSchott The filibuster was always the hindrance and not having an agreement that would secure 60 votes. But, I would agree that we should have had this debate sooner and found agreement. This is wrong. The SOTU is a time honored tradition, where the POTUS addresses the people of this great nation. I agree we need this shutdown to end &amp; encourage both sides to compromise, but I regret Pelosi’s choice to play partisan politics w/the SOTU. https://t.co/mWm54rE5NO Updated time for the NPR interview: You can listen in at 4:35pm Central on WOI 640 AM and KIOS 91.5 FM. Today I discussed the government shutdown and the need for compromise to end it with NPR. Feel free to tune in at 3 PM CST to listen to it! https://t.co/3XCsBNlWY8 Make no bones about it—we need NATO and NATO needs the United States. I support the President pressuring our allies to pay their fair share in defense spending. But, our commitment to NATO should not be threatened nor undermined. https://t.co/pjTQQ1nxXx This week Nancy Pelosi is scheduling multiple more “show votes” that is political grandstanding and won’t get our government to first base in reopening the government. Instead, Pelosi should start negotiating with the President earnestly. This gridlock is hurting innocent people. @jenndreibel I’ve been ready to seek a compromise. It takes two sides to do so... as soon as Pelosi is willing to seek a middle ground this shut down will end. Removing barriers and challenges that currently face America’s foster youth is a bipartisan task, requiring bipartisan solutions. Today I met with my fellow co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth to discuss our priorities for the 116th Congress. https://t.co/NsxJNVu5ce @jlumsden1 You’d make a great negotiator and facilitator. There’s some proposals from Republican side that is similar. Yesterday, I sent out a statement condemning the comments made by Rep. King. Read the full statement here: https://t.co/xhxeUBRcyj “Restrict off duty and retired law enforcement personnel from entering a venue while in possession of a firearm and you hamper more expedient responses to attacks.” I agree and will be reintroducing the LEOSA Reform Act soon to improve public safety. https://t.co/uwKIR2d5ST One of Congress’ crucial responsibilities is oversight over the Executive branch, however, partisan decisions such as this harms America. We should not be scrapping a vital Anti-Terrorism Subcommittee that helps us remain safe. https://t.co/KUnlyILvrn Our nation cannot afford gaps in information between local &amp; federal agencies. We cannot allow information to not reach those that need it as a crisis develops. For this reason I am reintroducing the DHS Field Engagement Accountability Act.

Featuring @GovRicketts, @Senato… I am grateful Dem Congresswoman Gabbard and OWH disagree with NE Democratic leadership on this... Nebraskans should unite behind a great nominee from Omaha in Brian Buescher and, regardless of party, be boldly against religious bigotry. https://t.co/qyi6Bf8BIj @MarrWilliams I’m glad some Dem leadership have stood up against the view you hold and of the two senators. Religious tests are against the Constitution.
