After a long day yesterday traveling around Iowa from Mason City to Waterloo to Cedar Rapids it was great to wind down the day in Iowa City at Micky’s! https://t.co/ZSocOPLwey Had a powerful conversation this afternoon with inspirational local leaders in Waterloo about the concerns facing their community. I believe that in this country we can restore our sense of common purpose by focusing on our common pain—that’s at the core of my campaign ahead. https://t.co/8IY18HItAo Incredible day in Iowa (and still going!)

Honored to start this journey in Mason City. https://t.co/li8Z5tGmXI The multiple detailed allegations against the Lt. Gov. of Virginia are deeply troubling.

We honor the victims by continuing their fight for justice &amp; equality. https://t.co/aTHmFGs30U The first question I was asked in Iowa was about #GreenNewDeal. The hard truth is climate change has imperiled our planet—it’s going to take bold action now to save it including dramatic investment in green energy that will create the jobs of the future. We can do this. https://t.co/zdU26AjcNN Grateful to kick off my first Iowa trip as a presidential candidate surrounded by 5 generations of family at my Aunt Alma's home.

My heart is with the Dingell family during this difficult time. https://t.co/pLpqqi7tCG Mr. Barr's record on mass incarceration and admitted lack of knowledge on the role of implicit racial bias in our criminal justice system were key factors in my no vote today. 2/ Our next Attorney General must defend civil rights and our shared principles of equal protection. I am not persuaded Mr. Barr will meet this challenge. I pray I am wrong. 1/ Excited to join @AOC &amp; @SenMarkey on a historic #GreenNewDeal resolution to address the peril of climate change and worsening inequality. Our history is a testimony to the achievement of what some think is impossible — we must take bold action now. This inspires me more than you know.

#gratitude https://t.co/vP2QD5wPFh People at a federal prison in Brooklyn are enduring unbearable, freezing conditions after going without heat and power for days — this is outrageous and inhumane. We need answers. https://t.co/O9snbhcBZn These images arouse centuries of anger, anguish, and racist violence and they’ve eroded all confidence in Gov. Northam’s ability to lead. We should expect more from our elected officials. He should resign. Today on the anniversary of the Greensboro sit-in we remember the struggle and sacrifice of the Greensboro Four—what happens when a group of people come together to sit in, and to stand up, for each other and our country. We still have work to do. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/0Igy5VEfbY Lo que nos une es mucho más de lo que nos divide. Cuando nos unimos y trabajamos juntos - progresamos juntos. My Aunt Alma is the incredible matriarch of our Iowa family - she means business! https://t.co/3QHMVjHBXM Huge smile! Kirsten, I am glad we are both in. 

As I told folks today on The View:  

You are my sister. There may be some sibling rivalry but we will always be family. https://t.co/EHqfZtdKYN Deeply grateful for you and this tweet my brother. 

Your integrity, strong sense of justice, and righteous and relentless activism is light in our nation. https://t.co/4xvyVpRaMK I’m not in this race to tear people down. I’m in it to build people up and bring people together to make progressive change and build a country that's more fair and more just. https://t.co/XSa9bUWr2G I know that together, we can… we will, rise.

I hope you’ll join me. https://t.co/NqOSrlvaS7 Despite our divisions, the hatred of some, and the economic hardship of many, together we will ensure that our generation and generations to come will achieve things others say can’t be done. When I went down to Washington, people told me it was a place where you couldn’t make change happen, but I’ve been able to pass laws that start to turn the tide against mass incarceration and spark historic investment in vulnerable communities. When I moved to Newark to protect tenants from slumlords, people told us we couldn't win. Well, we beat them. When I was mayor, we showed the doubters that impossible things could still happen in our city. I've spent my entire career running toward big challenges others had given up on, bringing people together to do things that we were told were impossible. That's what our country needs right now. People feel left out. They worry that the lines that divide us right now are stronger than the ties that bind us. I’m running to change that.

In America, we have a common pain, common challenges. But what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose. The promise of our country, that this is a country that works for everyone, is hanging in the balance. When we should be coming together to take on our biggest challenges, there are forces at work trying to split us apart. I want to take a couple minutes and share a few thoughts about why I’m running for president: Thanks for the pic. I miss my dad. He died days before I was elected to The Senate. 
He had wise words that kept me grounded. When I graduated Law School: "Boy u got more degrees than the month of July but you ain't hot, life's about the service you give not the degrees you get." https://t.co/A7y05UVKKd He told me when I was growing up that I was his "stunt double."

Shout out to @JulianCastro for not being the only presidential candidate that has a doppelgänger. https://t.co/hxwMlMo4QK So grateful for your kind feedback. Thank you. https://t.co/gGlLr4t2PE Michael this really moves me. Thank you for joining our team. We will work together to honor your Paw Paw and all of our ancestors who lived so that we could have a better, more just life. https://t.co/YSM4cuIB67 So grateful for my family in Iowa who gathered to watch me launch my campaign.

My grandmother was born and raised in Des Moines and I owe that community and the church she grew up in so much. #Roots https://t.co/V91sNG7OR3 We’re building this campaign together the right way: I won't take a single dollar from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists.

Our campaign will be funded by real people -- like YOU!

Chip in now to join our team: https://t.co/NrgbUJ5MpA My dad used to say to me: “Boy, don’t forget where you came from and the people who sacrificed to get you to where you are.” https://t.co/PqESzfPUYG My soul belongs to God. I fear no man. 

And I believe that anyone's individual capacity to denigrate will never be as strong as our collective power to elevate. https://t.co/YBEwRD9FjK Thank you for this commitment. https://t.co/RWlEuoy0OS That is not the call. The call is to unite with people around our shared values and ideals. Too many of us focus on the hate of the some and not the limitless potential strength of the active many.

In order for the American Dream to be alive and well, we must never forget our great nation was built by the love and hard work of immigrants. 7/ We must make #EnvironmentalJustice a rallying cry in 2019.

We must demand fairness https://t.co/2n18PVlnBk Thank you for pointing this out. I often do but definitely not enough. https://t.co/f6fzi1k6JH It is so good that even if we aren't "fans" we can still extend an open mind to each other and look for common ground. 

Thanks for this tweet and for extending me a bit of grace. 

Hope we cross paths one day. I bet there is a lot more we agree on. https://t.co/loEloHSYCY My questions exactly. https://t.co/umEDOCik6K RT @vanitaguptaCR: My takeaway from Barr so far is that despite powerful questioning by @SenatorDurbin and @CoryBooker, Barr is standing by… RT @mkraju: Cory Booker starts off his questioning of Bill Barr asking him about medical marijuana, and Barr suggests that he will allow me… Thanks.

Here's what we know… William Barr *literally* wrote &amp; published a book called "The Case for More Incarceration" while leading the Department of Justice. Found a copy in a law library. It's real.

The fight for criminal justice reform has made so much progress – we can't let forces take us back. https://t.co/pTwHohVwiJ I condemn the senseless attack by Al Shabab on the Dusit Hotel in Nairobi. Perpetrators of this horrific act should be held accountable and brought to justice. Americans posted at our Nairobi embassy and all Kenyans are in my thoughts. https://t.co/6NIw4bVP6c Today is the confirmation hearing on William Barr, Trump's pick for AG. I have objections. Take for example, this awful claim from Barr:
“The benefits of increased incarceration would be enjoyed disproportionately by black Americans living in inner cities.”

Absolutely not. ❌ This is an important first victory. Putting a citizenship question on the census is a cynical and sinister attempt to suppress participation and undercount immigrants short changing fair apportionment of resources and political representation. The fight continues. https://t.co/u1zlyiOjeO Happy 90th birthday to this warrior for justice.
