We had a great week in Washington. Haley and I heard our President’s encouraging words in his State of the Union, I continued to be a voice for our unborn children, and I gave my first speech on the floor on the importance of securing our southwest border. https://t.co/VVFo0cYD05 In case you missed it, @realDonaldTrump called for Congress and the American people to adopt a spirit of compromise in his State of the Union address. I’m proud to echo his message of unity and cooperation – together, we can build a bright future for the American people. https://t.co/tnydgKg5qQ I also signed on to @GOPLeader's bill that would prohibit abortion providers from taking the life of children born alive during abortions. We must fight for their right to life. If we are to remain a nation that values innocent life, we must never advance policies that lead to abortion on demand. Today, I cosponsored a bill that would make permanent the prohibition of the use of taxpayer funds for abortion services – including in Obamacare. https://t.co/jWkEdOol0Y Congratulations to Beverly Cotton of the MS Band of Choctaw Indians on her new appointment as the director of the Nashville Area Indian Health Services.

Nothing is more important for our continued prosperity than faith in our Heavenly Father. https://t.co/3A9n8EYw3F The video can be found here: https://t.co/gHdh0qnHyE As a member of the @HouseForeignGOP I had the opportunity to question policy experts on the status of US Foreign Policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Strong foreign policy in this region will help combat terrorism and extremism that threaten our nation &amp; our security around the world https://t.co/m839hmN2oW Yesterday, Dr. Mark Keenum presented our office a unique MS State “Statesman” football helmet – designed to honor an icon of MS public service, Congressman Sonny Montgomery. It’s an honor to represent @msstate, &amp; I’m humbled by this reminder of the significance of statesmanship. https://t.co/c8nUKU8MhE RT @WhiteHouse: Last night President Trump shared some great news:

We must choose unity. We must choose greatness. #SOTU @WhiteHouse https://t.co/NAz5L63PaC Our international presence casts an American vision of prosperity, democracy, and hope across our globe, and as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I look forward to supporting @realDonaldTrump on sound international policies. #SOTU Congress can work together with the @WhiteHouse to achieve bipartisan legislation that reinvigorates our expansive infrastructure system. New roads, bridges, ports, and utilities means higher economic growth, more jobs, and better trade. #SOTU https://t.co/iX7wcaYzeJ Do you agree with @realDonaldTrump that more should be done to end the crisis on our Southwest Border? https://t.co/ZhWcBCm5as Drugs are being manufactured, smuggled, and sold by transnational crime organizations in our communities. They are profiting off addiction, and we need additional border security – including a physical barrier – to curb the flow of these dangerous drugs into our community. #SOTU https://t.co/R95qzP0BRC I agree with @realDonaldTrump to allow individuals who want to help us build a strong future for America to enter our country legally. #SOTU America’s economy is stronger than ever thanks to @realDonaldTrump’s Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. These tax cuts are creating jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for all Americans, and we must work to make them permanent. #SOTU RT @HouseGOP: .@RepMichaelGuest is attending his first #SOTU tonight, but he has yet to find a solid spot for sweet tea in D.C.

Thanks to provisions in the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, Mr. James was hired to oversee the Vicksburg Forest Products lumber facility &amp; will join @realDonaldTrump tonight for the #SOTU https://t.co/f6vuXkWXiD There’s no one I’d rather have by my side during the State of the Union tomorrow night than my wonderful wife, Haley. She’s been an incredible source of strength, a wonderful mother to our two boys, and I look forward to sharing this special moment with you. https://t.co/PwJshG0W5b Congress must do more to keep these drugs from entering our country with common sense border security measures, including a physical barrier along our SW border. Over $1 million of cocaine was taken off the streets of my hometown thanks to our men and women in law enforcement.

 https://t.co/VTvRzYe2vK Fentanyl is now the most dangerous street-level drug we have ever seen in the United States, accounting for more deaths in 2017 than meth and heroine combined. Protecting our communities from these dangerous drugs starts with securing our SW border.
 
https://t.co/RD8MlsKa2R Earlier today, I signed a letter encouraging the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Committee to take the right steps to end the crisis at our southwest border by providing funds for technology, manpower, and a physical barrier. Read more here: https://t.co/1kFdUK89L6 Thank you for your kind words, General Rice. I will continue to support our men and women in military and promote the values that have made our great nation strong.
 
https://t.co/AsEc4YJ67s Mississippians deserve to have access to healthcare services in their communities. It was a pleasure to visit the Covington County Hospital in Collins today and meet with CEO Gregg Gibbes to discuss policy issues affecting rural hospitals. https://t.co/SeD08xMNui Abortion at anytime is immoral, but a bill allowing abortions when a woman is showing physical signs of labor is unconscionable. We must continue to be a voice for our unborn children and oppose any such bill introduced in Congress. 
https://t.co/UFku9DEbwp I’m honored to join so many talented Freshmen Members on @HouseHomeland, including @RepMarkGreen, @RepDanCrenshaw, @RepVanTaylor, and @RepJohnJoyce. I look forward to working with them and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep our country safe. https://t.co/bsepwh4g1E As a former prosecutor of numerous drug interdiction cases, I know that securing our southwest border is necessary. I hope that an agreement can be reached on a solution to the crisis at the border so that our government can remain open past February 15.

It was a pleasure to discuss how our office can be a resource as they create more opportunities for the blind and visually impaired https://t.co/owICEoVKJ7 I was honored to welcome the Georgian Parliamentary Delegation &amp; the First Vice Speaker of the Parliament into our office today. Democracy across our globe is vital to the prosperity of all nations &amp; I was honored to discuss how our two nations can continue to work together. https://t.co/VkUAP2vFfb This is great news for the people of Mississippi. Our energy industry is growing under conservative leadership and this expansion will lead to an even stronger economy for all Mississippians.
https://t.co/Pu5evwFf2C The Department of Homeland Security released new data showing the number of apprehensions between the points of entry on our southwest border has increased 81 percent this FY. Additional border security and a physical barrier is needed to end this trend, and it’s needed now. It was a pleasure to sit down with Mayor Percy Bland to discuss how we can work together to benefit Meridian and all of East Mississippi. I will continue to work with our local leaders for the people of Mississippi and the Third District. https://t.co/PR6xwCgS9U I strongly disagree with @SpeakerPelosi’s decision to deny @POTUS the chance to address our nation. As a country we need to work to end divisiveness and look for compromise, and I can’t think of a more appropriate event to bring us together for than a State of the Union address. I’m honored to announce that I have been selected to serve on @HouseHomeland &amp; @HouseForeignGOP. In these two roles I will work to ensure that our nation is secure &amp; that Mississippi remains a safe place to live, worship, and raise a family. https://t.co/UtUlUSfxxP Please visit our website, https://t.co/w4xHISw754 or call (202) 225-5031 to let us know about your visit!

https://t.co/7ADK64BjZI Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. changed our nation with his tenacity, his love for his fellow man, and a firm faith in our Heavenly Father.

https://t.co/hTBjZp0o5F We are now approaching 50 years since the ruling of Roe v. Wade, but the momentum to protect the right to life of our unborn children is growing every day. As your Congressman, I will continue to be a voice for our unborn children. https://t.co/kVH35NU0rj The scientific community is beginning to reveal what we’ve always known through our faith.

https://t.co/wsokm8f3H1 I’ve announced my support of pro-life legislation by joining the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus &amp; by cosponsoring legislation to declare life begins at conception. The lives of our unborn children are special &amp; I will continue to be a voice for the unborn. https://t.co/kskc0rkfgq I’ve enjoyed the insight I’ve gained from my new colleagues and friends in the freshman class. @RepGregPence dropped by today to discuss the important issues facing our districts and the many issues we’ll work to address as freshmen members. https://t.co/34VnZrHIcD As District Attorney, I prosecuted those who transported and sold illegal drugs in our communities.
