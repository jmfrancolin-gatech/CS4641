When Democrats stood our ground last month, we proved that Individual 1 does not have the public support to ram his hateful wall through Congress.

Let’s stand firm: #Not1Dollar for DHS. This is an outrage. I'm hearing from TSA workers back in Minnesota who STILL haven't received backpay after the shutdown. 

All workers affected by the shutdown—including contractors—deserve backpay!
https://t.co/x7jE0yJpan Thank you @DeanObeidallah for an honest conversation about the #SOTU address! https://t.co/ei4R200C1R Too often our discussions around healthcare revolve around corporations and profit instead of the humans impacted by our broken system.

I'm grateful to Chad Riedy for sharing his struggle with cystic fibrosis and its impact on his family at this week's @EdLaborCmte hearing. https://t.co/X6OnYTiavB My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and her whole family during this difficult time. John Dingell defined statesmanship. Every year, for 5 decades, Rep. Dingell would introduce a single-payer health care bill in the House. I know that when we finally pass Medicare for All to guarantee health care as a human right, John will be smiling down. 🙏🏽 https://t.co/J2HVLkxOmf In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million.

The median pay for a McDonald's worker that year was $7,000.

This is a moral outrage. We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. https://t.co/TIxZMlzQF6 #RaiseTheWage This is the biggest challenge of our time. Let’s seize the moment. Let’s put the policies behind the Green New Deal into law! 💪🏽 We cannot let the urgency of this die. We can’t just settle for a select committee or resolution. We rallied for a big bold solution and momentum for our policies is at an all-time high. That’s why one of my top priorities is a bill to fully divest from dirty energy. We are here to legislate to our reality. And the reality is we’re in the majority. We need to pass a #GreenNewDeal to shift away from fossil fuels and create millions of jobs. I too came to this country as a refugee.

The difference between what is happening to these little girls and me is that I didn't have a cage waiting for me.  I had an open arm.
