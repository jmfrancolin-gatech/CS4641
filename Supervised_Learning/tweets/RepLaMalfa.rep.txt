Full release: https://t.co/vXcETGu1V7 https://t.co/TlduSD7nQE Important news for #CampFire recovery: FEMA has extended the deadline to register for disaster assistance to January 31, 2019. https://t.co/XgZabwKYSh @POTUS has issued the challenge tonight with a comprehensive plan. There are no excuses not to debate and legislate one accordingly. #SecureOurBorder Their unwillingness to negotiate speaks volumes about their priorities to defy a President &amp; the overwhelming number of Americans that want solutions, not gridlock. In San Diego, illegal traffic has dropped 92% since a barrier was built in 1992. Democrats do have some history of supporting physical barriers at the southern border. What has changed? They seem only to oppose it now to impede this President. The status quo is dangerous and is inflicting harm on real people and real families. Walls work – in sections of the southern border where a physical barrier is already present, we’ve seen a marked decrease in illegal immigration. Over the last two months, we’ve seen an 86% increase in the amount of illegal immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents compared to the same period last year. President Trump is right – the situation at our southern border is a humanitarian &amp; national security crisis. #SecureOurBorder Take advantage of this opportunity, starting tomorrow, to help ensure your property is best prepared for future disasters. @Cal_OES &amp; @fema announced mitigation specialists will be on hand at Home Depot in Chico to provide free advice for those beginning to rebuild &amp; repair their homes, property, &amp; businesses in the wake of the #CampFire. https://t.co/d1UziDArHE RT @GOPLeader: There is a humanitarian crisis happening along our Southern border.

Unfortunately, the bill today lacks both. It has been clear for weeks that in order for a funding bill to pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the President it will need to be a compromise. The Senate has said they won’t consider this bill and the President has said he would veto this bill. The funding bill passed by Democrats tonight wasn’t a serious attempt to reopen the government, but the beginning of a stunt that takes time away from finding a solution. (4/4) I’m optimistic that the House, Senate, and the President can all work together to further legislation that will meaningfully benefit the American people, and I’ll ensure the North State’s voice is heard loud and clear. Now, it’s time to get to work.

(2/3) Remember - most of the government has already been funded through the year, &amp; a government shutdown won’t affect our parks, TSA, or the FEMA employees currently assisting with disasters in Butte &amp; Shasta counties &amp; the hurricane-affected states elsewhere in the country. (1/3) While it appears the Senate won’t pass a funding bill tonight, I’m proud that the House has stayed here to fight for disaster funding and security at our southern border. It’s worth the fight. I commend Republican leadership for adding to the funding bill much-needed disaster relief for the west coast &amp; south, as well as the border security measure demanded by most Americans.

States will finally have a clear definition of where federal jurisdiction ends &amp; begins, as well as the ability to properly manage their own water. Instead of attempting to needlessly regulate every puddle, ditch, and furrow in America, the new rule will focus on bodies of water and wetlands that are physically and meaningfully connected to other bodies of jurisdictional water. After listening to those directly impacted by one of the previous Administration’s most harmful rules, the @EPA is replacing #WOTUS with something that actually makes sense for land and business owners.
