Bill benefits and strengthens education benefits for generations to come. #mtpol https://t.co/k9jg3c9ARj Matt Kuntz has been a tremendous advocate for Montana veterans‚Äô access to mental health screenings and treatment. His years of experience innovating and improving mental health treatment will be a huge asset to the @DeptVetAffairs. @namimontana
https://t.co/UOqpt6dn4G Dedicating today‚Äôs #FlattopFriday to the @NFFF_News &amp; all the men and women who risk life and limb to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/bTzrj2PNkB This week I took to the @SenateFloor to stop the expansion of junk health insurance plans that don‚Äôt even cover the basics. Unfortunately, we fell one vote short. But I won‚Äôt stop fighting until every Montanan can see a doctor w/o breaking the bank. #mtpol
https://t.co/2DtnKk2rJS RT @NGAUS1878: NGAUS president, Ret. Brig. Gen. Roy Robinson, presented the Harry S. Truman Award, the Association's highest honor, to @Sen‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an honor to receive the Harry S. Truman Award for Distinguished Service in Support of National Defense from @NGAUS1878. I will never stop fighting to honor those who bravely serve our nation, especially our citizen soldiers and airmen of the @NationalGuard. #mtpol https://t.co/kswerAFrix Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to sell long-term junk plans to Montana families. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sponsoring legislation to stop corporations from shilling shoddy plans that don‚Äôt cover Montanans‚Äô basic health care needs. #mtpol #WhatsAtRisk https://t.co/qdNMxi2k0l A few years ago, Kalispell community and business leaders approached me with a plan &amp; we were able to secure a $10 million grant to build the Glacier Rail Park. Today we celebrated the grand opening of this new rail park! #mtpol https://t.co/91JtJLOj84 Today's news is a positive step forward, but it‚Äôs only a temporary solution. I will continue fighting to pass my bill that permanently bans mining on the doorstep of @YellowstoneNPS to protect it for generations to come. #mtpol #DontMineYellowstone https://t.co/2NEIM3CfVe 2 yrs ago we secured a temporary mining ban on the doorstep of @YellowstoneNPS‚Äîwhich expires at the end of the month. So I‚Äôm calling on @SecretaryZinke to extend this ban until we can pass my Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act. #mtpol #DontMineYellowstone
https://t.co/X2p7lMJNKa As someone who still lives in the tiny town I grew up in, I firmly believe that there is no better place to live, work &amp; raise a family than rural America. That's why, as a Senator, I'm working hard to tackle our challenges &amp; increase opportunities across rural America.  #mtpol https://t.co/Az7AcSgysL #FlattopFriday https://t.co/Sp1mop5Q3f When corporations sell their workers down the river, they shouldn't be able to cash in on the backs of taxpayers. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm introducing a bill to eliminate tax breaks for corporations‚Äîlike @Imerys‚Äîthat lockout workers out during labor disputes. #mtpol https://t.co/s88NktgGAk https://t.co/KhDSmTC8lR This morning I had the honor of presenting an American flag to the families of the 103 firefighters who died in the line of duty this year. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I will continue to make sure our country does right by these heroes. @NFFF_News https://t.co/Ze0l70wbeU BIG NEWS: My bill to reauthorize LWCF cleared the Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee yesterday!

We need to hold contractors accountable to taxpayers &amp; shine more light on how our government does business. #mtpol https://t.co/WhZJbfZDDX There are some places you just shouldn‚Äôt dig or drill &amp; the doorstep of @YellowstoneNPS is one of them. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been fighting to get my Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act to the President‚Äôs desk &amp; today it cleared a major hurdle! #mtpol READ MORE: https://t.co/eGJkpxPJJI https://t.co/hxf4nVDUL6 After going toe-to-toe with @BetsyDeVosED over her attempt to deny funding for the @umontana's Upward Bound program last year, I‚Äôm introducing legislation to defend Montana students against decisions that could put their college educations at risk. #mtpol
https://t.co/vx7Bus74ZA A good education is the key to a great future. That‚Äôs why I met with folks representing Native American schools across Montana last week to brainstorm solutions for improving education in Indian Country so we can set students up for success. #mtpol https://t.co/mY64G0KdCa "The Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund has silently been behind success stories across Montana, and small communities like Whitefish are all the better because of the access and investment in public lands supported by LWCF. " #mtpol #SaveLWCF #KeepItPublic
https://t.co/qniWlhDGyC The current #FarmBill expires tomorrow &amp; as a farmer, I know how important it is for rural America. That's why it‚Äôs critically important that we pass a new Farm Bill that gives farmers and ranchers the certainty they need in these uncertain times. #mtpol

The A/C isn't working so well, so he says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDo any of you sell personal information? Yes or no?‚Äù That's what I asked tech execs at the @SenateCommerce hearing. The right to privacy is enshrined in our Constitution &amp; we need to make sure it's protected‚Äînot just on paper, but online. Watch more here: https://t.co/XGXeQwxXyn https://t.co/EXhIqjkTti Have a crazy day here in the Senate! Kicked things off with Montana Coffee, a few interviews, and a whole mess of meetings. Just grilled top tech execs at the @SenateCommerce hearing on data collection &amp; online privacy. Follow along with updates below! #mtpol https://t.co/ySbmn75DBG RT @GauravLaroia: @jontester is right. Why should companies get to sell/monetize information they don't think is private but I do? RT @FreeFairMarkets: When @SenatorTester asks Amazon straight up if it sells yours data, Amazon is not able to give him a clear answer. Jus‚Ä¶ RT @AnnaBurkhart: Senator Tester is ‚Äúa farmer, not a technology guy‚Äù and does not understand why he keeps getting targeted ads for tires #d‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been fighting since 2008 to bring Senate elections into the 21st Century &amp; last week @POTUS finally signed my #EFile bill into law. This will require Senate candidates to file their finance disclosures online so folks can access them immediately. #TransparencyTuesday #mtpol https://t.co/lEFd5Y5ZaN We must crack down on the dark money flooding our political system. That's why we‚Äôve introduced legislation to overturn @USTreasury's decision to allow special interests to hide their donors from the IRS. #mtpol
https://t.co/3vyk8W3m8z RT @SVACDems: On Wed. Sept. 26, @DeptVetAffairs Secretary Robert Wilkie will give a progress report on his first 60 days. @SenatorTester wa‚Ä¶ Montana‚Äôs outdoor economy generates $7.1 billion &amp; supports 71k jobs/yr. A lot of this is made possible by the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund. If we don‚Äôt #SaveLWCF, which expires in 7 days, those 71k jobs &amp; $7.1 billion will begin a countdown of their own. #KeepItPublic #mtpol https://t.co/GntUsaZBgk If we want Montana to thrive we have to make sure Montanans can thrive. That's why, when it comes to drug abuse and addiction, we've got to figure out ways to help people get back on their feet. ‚Äã#mtpol
https://t.co/u3vgjSpKwu With the signing of my bipartisan e-file bill, the Senate is finally joining the 21st Century! I've been fighting for over 10 years to make this commonsense idea a reality, and now elections will be more transparent for everyone. #mtpol

Post your questions HERE: https://t.co/iZ03R6EXzk https://t.co/QaC0EmWVo2 As of yesterday, consumers are now guaranteed free credit freezes thanks to our bill signed in May.

Now we need a permanent solution. #mtpol #dontmineyellowstone
https://t.co/0BOQdG9I6P Overcoming addiction is a huge challenge, but if we don‚Äôt address this problem it won't get any better. That‚Äôs why we passed not one, but two major bills this week to address the drug epidemic and help folks get back on their feet. #mtpol

Check it out here: https://t.co/buscGwROBF Had a great discussion with @MFUfarmers about trade, tariffs &amp; the #2018FarmBill last week. These issues are critical to our farmers &amp; ranchers, which is why I have and will continue to fight for long-term certainty and stability in Montana's #1 industry. #mtpol https://t.co/FxXpFtATt2 Since its creation in 1965, #LWCF has become one of the best tools we have to expand public access to our public lands. But funding for LWCF is set to expire in exactly 2 weeks. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm demanding that Congress bring up a vote to reauthorize LWCF and #KeepItPublic #mtpol https://t.co/qsqu01gPdE As a Montanan, I want to tell all the folks experiencing #HurricaneFlorence that we‚Äôre with you &amp; as Ranking Member of the committee that funds @FEMA I will do everything I can to make sure you have what you need to stay safe and recover quickly.

https://t.co/yh3UXF7a53 Health care costs are too high, especially prescription drug costs. That‚Äôs why I've introduced legislation to get more generic options on the market, hold big pharma accountable &amp; increase transparency when it comes to price hikes. #mtpol
