https://t.co/47o8uVVAiG ‚úÖ Signed up and ready to go! Is it 2019 yet? #116thCongress @USProgressives https://t.co/Y8lG6VoN6Q @portlandmercury I‚Äôm making a list and checking it twice... Healthcare is a right, not privilege. If we do this right, we can lay the foundation not only for dramatic coverage expansion under #ACA, but for a future in which every American can #getcovered, no matter the age, econ. status or pre-existing conditions. #MedicareforAll (3/3) This is the 2nd major attempt to gut a law for which they have no viable alternative. This is our moment to redouble our efforts to understand and advance proposals related to #MedicareforAll &amp; ensuring all Americans #getcovered, no matter what. #ACA When @GOP launched their assault on the #ACA soon after assuming control of Congress &amp; WH, I predicted they would accelerate the #SinglePayer movement by 10 yrs. W/ this latest court ruling putting the ACA in more jeopardy, they cut that time frame in half. #MedicareforAll (1/3) Zinke &amp; this admin‚Äôs legacy is one of damaging our public lands for the enrichment of the few &amp; undermining protections for our environment &amp; wild creatures. 

Now, will they get someone worse? House D‚Äôs will keep the spotlight on these reckless people &amp; fight them at every turn. https://t.co/JXpSZRx2LZ This is outrageous! The coordinated attack on the Affordable Care Act by the #GOP continues, despite the fact that elections across the country were won on supporting #ACA. We will keep fighting.  See you in another court! #HealthcareforAll https://t.co/IXIa2ruIca Thank YOU @sunrisemvmt and activists for YOUR passion and leadership for a better, greener future. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/vaHp6HUa0b It‚Äôs been 6 years since the tragic #SandyHook Elementary mass shooting &amp; since then, 1,917 mass shootings have gone by without any common sense solutions. No more. The tide is turning.  #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/OKWorXfmn8 This is horrifying. This admin &amp; their brutal, inhumane tactics have shocked, traumatized, and resulted in the loss of an innocent child‚Äôs life.  Democrats will ensure an immediate investigation into how this took place. This behavior by @CBP must end. https://t.co/F5KsO4B8oB The tradition continues in the nation‚Äôs capital! 

Spreading holiday cheer one fruitcake and @saltandstraw ice cream at a time. #BlumenauerFruitcake https://t.co/IOomicKMHS Yep, that‚Äôs the plan. https://t.co/MgINZ34qjr We should  not allow him to shut down the government, or give him money which he promised Mexico would supply that would add to the yawning deficit or short change other vital priorities. Make him deliver. #TrumpWall #TrumpShutDown (4/4) We should be as unequivocal as Trump. If he knows how to do these things, and if he is the master negotiator and master builder, he will build the wall with Mexican money. #TrumpWall #TrumpShutDown (3/4) The most unequivocal promise from his campaign as that he would build a wall and that Mexico would pay for it. 
We should simply go home and let him deliver on his unequivocal, often repeated campaign promise. (2/4) https://t.co/lh92cezsRX Put aside the fact that Trump's wall is a stupid idea and will never be built, we should stop pretending you can negotiate with him over the wall. But, as Trump himself pointed out, we don't need to. (1/4) Seeing this on the anniversary of the #ParisAgreement is troubling. How many more reports are needed to document this urgent crisis? 

It‚Äôs time for bold action with a #GreenNewDeal #ActOnClimate
https://t.co/82yTpTi4vD These days, bad outcomes that could‚Äôve been worse count as victories. It‚Äôs time to change the dynamic.

In the meantime, the crisis in American agriculture, the threats to most farmers and ranchers, the challenges to giving Americans healthy food, must wait for another Farm Bill. This Farm Bill is a disappointment. It‚Äôs a massive waste of tax payer dollars that does little to address climate change or improve nutrition for families. Just because the bill could be worse, that‚Äôs no reason to vote for it, so I will oppose. Trump‚Äôs repeated lies about the border wall are not new. Some presidents lie, but he takes it to new lows by constantly peddling outright falsehoods. 

When he misleads his supporters, it damages democracy. But when his lies drive our policy, he threatens the world as we know it. https://t.co/4SANJWwUn5 As if separating children at the border wasn‚Äôt enough, the Trump Admin is looking to reduce legal immigration by further complicating the process &amp; penalizing people for applying to programs that support their basic needs. 

It‚Äôs not the Oregon way and I‚Äôm fighting back. https://t.co/Qozm7FwLGX This is wrong! Not surprised to see the Trump administration choose private gain over the environment. Jan. 3rd can‚Äôt come soon enough! https://t.co/aC3seBm1m0 One of the most exciting parts of the #GreenNewDeal and #sunrisemvmt is it‚Äôs being led by young people who recognize their future (and all of our futures) are at stake if we don‚Äôt urgently address the climate crisis. https://t.co/Jl01Jta51X Rose City ‚ÄòTill I Die! #RCTID #PortlandTimbers With my grandsons, both mega Timbers fans, at the Christmas Tuba celebration at Portland‚Äôs Pioneer Square.

My team is in Atlanta representing. #RCTID #portlandtimbers https://t.co/Lxzo4VRK0g Cutting outreach funding is all a part of the Trump admin doing everything they can to gut the ACA &amp; take healthcare from millions of Americans. 

If they don't want to get the word out, we will.

Every child deserves a bike &amp; I‚Äôm glad @ChloeEudalyPDX was able to join me to see hundreds of kids get their first. https://t.co/xedS47QdWP Under Republicans, the federal government has stalled on climate action, even as the latest #NCA4 report from Trump‚Äôs own administration makes it clear that this is a crisis. 

The new Democratic House majority will #ActOnClimate with a #GreenNewDeal 

#ClimateFriday We‚Äôre Back! You‚Äôre Welcome! #RCTID  #timbers @RashidaTlaib @Ocasio2018 We have one for you too! 

Compliments of @NWGSDPDX üôå RT @Ocasio2018: I was pumped! A local grassroots women‚Äôs group gave @repblumenauer a flag poster, and also asked him to give one to me. 

I‚Ä¶ .@NWGSDPDX, look who loves your sign ‚Äî @Ocasio2018!

These are the values we will be fighting for! https://t.co/vEUOwtPUQi .@RepBarbaraLee willingness to serve illustrated her phenomenal commitment to our party &amp; compelling vision for our future. Thank you!

Hakeem is as skillful as he is thoughtful. A rising star who will lead our caucus well. Congratulations to our new Caucus Chair @RepJeffries! You would think after losing a nat'l election, creating a blue wave &amp; exploding the budget deficit, GOP would have learned that tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; powerful are not popular. 

Voters elected Democrats to actually listen to the needs of our families. It's time to start. RT @PattyMurray: I am proud to join @SenJeffMerkley and @repblumenauer in helping fulfill the federal government‚Äôs long overdue obligation‚Ä¶ Extremely proud to say congratulations to City Councilor-elect @eddymorales! 

Eddy‚Äôs vision, commitment to community engagement and energy will make him an outstanding representative of Gresham and all of East County. https://t.co/G9RIjsuwQq Reprehensible. Another unnecessary ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù entirely of Trump's making. We should be treating desperate people fleeing violence with dignity and respect.  

Another black eye for Trump and sadly, the United States. https://t.co/0zXzyKBMON Earlier this week, I went around PDX with Tyler Malek w/ @saltandstraw giving a sneak peak to this years "Congressman Blumenauer Fruitcake" ice cream to a few special celebrities. Proceeds went toward the @CommCyclingCtr Holiday Bike Drive. 

Great city. Great Tradition. https://t.co/mxB1kCMPx6 RT @RepJoeKennedy: From health care to criminal justice, the failures of our nation's prohibition on marijuana can be seen in every corner‚Ä¶ As the vice chair of the last Select Committee on Global Warming &amp; Energy Independence, I am thrilled to see renewed energy &amp; passion about getting it started again trying to create a #GreenNewDeal to create jobs &amp; help those most impacted by climate disruption &amp; toxic pollution. Welcome to Congress! Excited for you to join the Congressional Bike Caucus‚Äîpromoting livable communities and burning calories, not carbon. https://t.co/lTsm84ZwLw Looking forward to voting for @NancyPelosi as speaker when the Democratic Caucus meets. 

It‚Äôs time for Democrats to unite as she has consistently shown outstanding skill, vision &amp; commitment. But, the days of GOP control of the House are numbered. When Dems take back control, I will fight to put an end to the GOP putting politics over facts. 

When it comes to the environment &amp; protecting endangered species, science‚Äînot mindless politics‚Äîshould rule the day. Since House R's have been in charge, they've had an abysmal record on animal welfare and their first move after the recess was to remove all gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act. Scaling back protections now is not only wrong, it has no basis in science. I unequivocally reject white nationalism and recognize it is a threat to individuals, communities, and American democracy itself.
