I'm joining @FoxBusiness at 6pm to discuss border security and #Amazon. Consider tuning in! .@realDonaldTrump has made #infrastructure investment a national priority. I was proud to welcome @SecElaineChao from @USDOT to Jacksonville today to celebrate two federal grant awards totaling $25 million. This is a big win for Jacksonville and our entire Northeast FL region. https://t.co/25i2wIH6hj The #GreenNewDeal is dangerous for our country. Free will dies with a socialist agenda. I hope my colleagues across the aisle reject these socialist proposals and find ways to address our nation’s challenges without resorting to authoritarian policies. The most ridiculous part of #GreenNewDeal is how they propose paying for it – extending unspecified credit from the Federal Reserve. However, they reassure us that “the question isn’t how will we pay for it, but what will we do with our new shared prosperity.” Shared Prosperity? In the #GreenNewDeal, Democrats would provide a job for everyone in America, but they would also give money to those “unwilling to work.” Why take the job when staying home pays the bills? In the #GreenNewDeal, Democrats would eliminate all air travel, which may make it difficult to get around both domestically and internationally. Although they did acknowledge they “aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows." https://t.co/Mqqvz5nnlT This morning, the office of @AOC and progressive Democrats released a now-deleted proposal of their socialist agenda for America known as the #GreenNewDeal. In case you missed it, here are some of the highlights: RT @JAXChamber: Secretary Chao will join Mayor Curry, Congressman @RepRutherfordFL, @FDOT_Secretary Kevin Thibault, Jacksonville City Counc… RT @Nemours: Nemours CEO, Dr Larry Moss and @RepRutherfordFL on Capitol Hill after a great discussion around policies that can benefit chil… Check out my interview this morning with @WJXTvic and @wjxt4 to discuss @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU address.
https://t.co/ag0xzpPRQO The Jewish people are the apple of God’s eye. Thank you @realdonaldtrump for standing strong with Israel and Jewish people everywhere. #SOTU While some Democrats in Congress tout the “benefits” of socialism, #Venezuela has seen its deadly effects. We must stand strong for the American principles of freedom and liberty that make our country great. #SOTU Infanticide is not healthcare.
At 20 weeks: A baby feels pain
At 22 weeks: A baby can survive premature birth
And yet, some heartbreaking state proposals seek to kill newborn babies. Thank you @realDonaldTrump  for your unwavering support of the unborn #ProLife #SOTU Securing our porous border and solving our humanitarian crisis requires a multi-layered approach #SOTU https://t.co/gv3oAYZZyO As a former sheriff, I support @realDonaldTrump's dedication to reforming our criminal justice system and giving our fellow citizens a second chance. The #FirstStepAct is not soft on crime, but smart on crime. #SOTU It is unquestionable that our nation is stronger today under @realDonaldTrump than two years ago.
 
✅Highest expected GDP growth since 2005
✅Fastest wage growth in a decade
✅Highest Small Business Optimism in 35 years

Imagine what we can accomplish in the years to come. #SOTU The unemployment rate will be at its lowest point during any #SOTU since 2000. #ChoosingGreatness Tonight, @realDonaldTrump will deliver the #SOTU in the midst of 100 straight months of job growth. #ChoosingGreatness This morning I visited @sulzbacherjax and their new community for homeless women and their families. I thank the wonderful staff for the important work they do in an effort to reduce #homelessness and empower women and their families to thrive. https://t.co/Kl3tBIvEzo A treaty with ourselves is not a treaty. This is the right call by @realDonaldTrump and a strong response to Russia's aggression and dangerous disregard of our agreements. #INFTreaty https://t.co/ez13rbamnV The heartbreaking prevalence of veteran homelessness must continue to be prioritized and addressed. 38,000 homeless #Veterans are counting on us. Check out this incredible program at the @DeptVetAffairs  aiming to serve our aging #Veterans in need. I thank the foster families for the love and support they give to our nation's heroes. https://t.co/y9zle7AiXc The wall, technology, and border agents all work together to achieve operational control of our border. If you remove one of these from the equation, our borders become less secure, our country less safe, and our communities at a greater risk of drugs and crime. I have never seen a drone put handcuffs on a criminal. We need more agents on the ground to make arrests and process individuals who enter our nation illegally. Drones, alert systems, and other technology monitor our border and direct officers to illegal crossings when and where they occur. But it’s not enough. Walls, fencing, and other physical impediments discourage illegal crossings. They force traffickers and criminals to spend significant time and effort digging tunnels and climbing, offering law enforcement the time to detect individuals attempting to illegally cross the border. As a former Sheriff, I know that the best security plans require a multi-layered approach. This remains especially true for our southern border. Today, a bipartisan, bicameral group of members is meeting to negotiate a package of resources – barriers, technology, and human resources – to help us finally bring our border under operational control. .@NatlHeadStart programs provide vital services for over 34,000 families and their youngsters in Florida. I enjoyed meeting with local families and leaders today to hear their stories and discuss how Congress can bolster early education in Northeast Florida. https://t.co/CGEBWGe2sq Proud to announce my reappointment to the Appropriations Committee. I look forward to ensuring precious taxpayer dollars are spent wisely while working to promote our national priorities, like a robust national defense, a secure border, and enhanced resources for our veterans. https://t.co/9PvYt4piiz Great shoutout to the Southern League’s best team! A sign of good things ahead for the @JaxShrimp. #AffordableFamilyFun #CrustaceanNation https://t.co/JNe1HV23sQ Great news for @NASJax_! https://t.co/DYJBoBM0rJ My statement on @realDonaldTrump's announcement ending the shutdown: https://t.co/JXZavLhQW3 RT @SenBillCassidy: An increasing number of Democrats in Congress say they are willing to support physical barriers on the southern border: .@SpeakerPelosi sends Congress home on the day federal employees miss another paycheck. We should be staying in Washington working to find a solution to #EndTheShutdown. .@realDonaldTrump has offered a compromise to end the shutdown. Instead of coming to the table, @SpeakerPelosi is playing politics with the State of the Union. In the meantime, our federal employees are set to miss their second paycheck. Enough! Last week I had the opportunity to welcome Liberty Pines Academy to Washington, D.C. It was great to chat with the students and see their enthusiasm for visiting the nation's capital! https://t.co/Q5F8z2GRby Yesterday, I joined the Association for Mature American Citizens for a discussion on the work we are doing in Congress. I appreciated the many questions on securing our border and solving our immigration challenges, as well as protecting Medicare and Social Security. https://t.co/lpIZG2FHkB My statement on @realDonaldTrump’s good faith effort to find compromise: https://t.co/yjrk6Fjucs An organization whose core mission has taken the lives of 61 million unborn children should not receive taxpayer funds. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/NNaJ906I40 I had a great time showing off the Capitol to young adults from Northeast Florida in Washington for #MarchForLife. I thank them for their commitment to the sanctity of life and protecting the unborn. https://t.co/3UJq6r1aJx I agree with @realDonaldTrump. Speaker Pelosi should be in Washington to negotiate a compromise for the American people. Federal workers in Northeast Florida deserve better! https://t.co/1spMTsLadc WATCH: It is no secret that I have expressed frustration over the Majority’s decision to bring funding bills to the floor that have no chance of being signed into law. Americans deserve a solution which requires a willingness to compromise. 
https://t.co/p6BAn4jnYg WATCH: House Democrats hit a new low today by using states ravaged by natural disasters as political pawns. They attached a poison pill provision to score political points and ensure the bill's failure, instead of helping fellow citizens in distress. 
https://t.co/1b7tuxVzXd WATCH: Today I went back to the House floor to urge Speaker Pelosi to end this shutdown by bringing a bill to the floor that Senate will pass and the President will sign.

May God bless their friends and loved ones as we honor their service to our great country. https://t.co/XjC2hSMCPC Proud of the Sailors and Marines aboard Mayport’s own USS Fort McHenry. This display of @USNavy strength is an important response to Russian aggression against our allies. https://t.co/4KucoWFDCK Thanks to Republican tax cuts, wages continue to rise as employers flood the market with jobs.

As you gather with family and friends tomorrow, remember that you are following a Florida tradition that dates back to at least 1564!https://t.co/ctvJEAQUoo Empowering veterans both during and after their service remains a top priority of mine.

The House passed H.Res 990 to show support for the men and women of ICE who protect our country from terrorist plots, drugs, trafficking &amp; more. ICE agents deserve our appreciation for keeping us safe. Suggesting we abolish ICE is reckless &amp; wrong We welcomed @SecretarySonny at the Working Forest Caucus for a roundtable discussion on the role of innovation and applied research in expanding forest products markets. Forestry is an important component of our NE FL economy https://t.co/yV4YAgBro3 A new economic report finds no positive case for waiving the Jones Act in Puerto Rico.
