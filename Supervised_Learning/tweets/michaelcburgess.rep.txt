Thank you to the @FlowerMoundHS Debate Team for stopping by the @uscapitol to meet with me during your trip to Washington, D.C. It was a privilege to talk with these bright North Texas students on the Capitol steps. https://t.co/LA4Y1SZ0wP .@EnergyCommerce Democrats refuse to hold a hearing on their extreme health care plan to strip Americans of private health insurance, force patients into single-payer &amp; government-run health care, cost taxpayers $32 trillion, &amp; end Medicare as we know it .https://t.co/J97XiDm5Sx This week I reintroduced H.R. 1040, the Flat Tax Act. Every Congress since 2003, I’ve introduced this commonsense legislation to ensure that all Americans pay their fair share in taxes. More: https://t.co/bGCHCMXGP3 https://t.co/wsHR4hLEQ2 Chairman John Dingell was a lifelong public servant and legislative giant. His matchless wisdom, persistence, and humor will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress, and especially in the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room that bears his name. Congress cannot bring back their loved ones, but my North Texas constituent Chris and other #AngelFamilies do deserve justice. We must act to protect the American people and defend our borders to prevent further heartbreak. #BorderSecurity https://t.co/nOqrcsYTIR https://t.co/KZcDzzuVpy Under the Trump Administration, @SecAzar and @HHSGov are providing excellent care to the children entrusted to their custody. At today’s @EnergyCommerce hearing, we should recognize these public servants for their steadfast service to these children. As a physician and a congressman, I take oversight of @HHSGov very seriously. Thanks to @HouseCommerce GOP’s efforts, unaccompanied children in ORR custody are now screened for medical, dental, and mental health, in addition to sexual abuse and vulnerability to #humantrafficking. During the Obama Administration at the height of the unaccompanied minor crisis in 2014, I visited HHS ORR facilities and was horrified by the conditions I found. Quite simply, it is downright inhumane to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our southern border – often atop of La Bestia. https://t.co/veOtFGFikl It’s always a pleasure to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, and I am glad that North Texans Vince and Mona Puente were able to join me for this outstanding event. https://t.co/Sx2PqMNLFP I was saddened to hear about Chairman @JohnDingell's health challenges. My thoughts and prayers are with my friend &amp; Energy and Commerce legend @JohnDingell and @RepDebDingell at this difficult time. Encouraging families to make the treacherous journey across the desert to our southern border is not only wrong, it’s inhumane. #SOTU https://t.co/gQqas6xyXV This evening President @realDonaldTrump offered an optimistic message of hope and unity to the American people. My statement on tonight’s #SOTU: https://t.co/Sfb4YpaPJV While Democrats are working to force Americans into government-run, single-payer health care, I’m fighting to lower drug costs and make the health care system work for – and not against – American patients and doctors. #SOTU President Trump is committed to protecting workers &amp; fighting unfair #trade deals by equalizing U.S. tariffs with those of other nations. Congress should ensure @POTUS has the ability to negotiate from a position of strength for the American people. #SOTU https://t.co/ADzeMnWpk9 Sovereign nations must define + defend their borders. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump should have the resources he needs to defend the American people from gang violence, crime, drugs, and human trafficking. #SOTU #BorderSecurity All of us can - and should - work together to choose greatness for our fellow Americans. From strengthening our national defense to protecting American workers and investing in our infrastructure, President @realDonaldTrump is committed to creating a better tomorrow.  #SOTU Despite Democrats’ obstruction, @realDonaldTrump’s Administration and Republicans in Congress continue to deliver on our promises to the American people. #SOTU https://t.co/eodejSNAaM It’s an honor to welcome U.S. veteran, Angel Dad, and TX-26 constituent Chris to attend tonight’s #SOTU. https://t.co/dDUm8iTduB Technology is playing an increasingly-vital role in the detection and prevention of disease, including the #flu. It was great to visit @TeladocHealth in Lewisville with Commissioner @BrendanCarrFCC to learn how Teladoc serves American patients from afar. https://t.co/G07Wh2HJ5N Today @FCC Commissioner @BrendanCarrFCC and I attended the opening of @ericsson's new Lewisville facility, which joins a number of North Texas companies that are leading the way in innovation for the 21st century. https://t.co/RRfceqGuY2 Tomorrow morning, I'll join @MariaBartiromo at 6am CT/7am ET to preview President @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU and more. Hope you’ll tune in. Don’t let the queso sit out too long. @CDCgov has helpful tips for keeping your gameday snacks safe. #SuperBowlSunday https://t.co/BVDxaJ1BAR Thank you to the Greater Dallas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to join its Chinese New Year celebration. I wish all who celebrate a happy, safe, and prosperous year ahead. https://t.co/l8I8tpdCZF While Republicans focus on pro-growth policy, Democrats are fighting to strip hardworking Americans of their private insurance and force them into radical “one-size-fits-all” single-payer, government-run health care. The excellent January #jobsreport not only indicates that 300,000+ more Americans have jobs, but also that more families have access to employer-sponsored health insurance - a far better option than #Obamacare marketplace or any other government-mandated coverage. Thanks to @dentonisd leaders for visiting my D.C. office this week. We had a productive conversation about serving North Texas students. https://t.co/JmRpNcpOW4 Thanks to @MarkDavis for hosting me on his @660KSKY show this morning to discuss the fight for #bordersecurity and more. Listen in here: https://t.co/vJVD2yV0xl https://t.co/Lp7UYW7GA0 As #HumanTraffickingPreventionMonth comes to a close, we remember the evils of human trafficking and highlight ways we can prevent abuse. Especially as we consider #bordersecurity, we must work to stop the trafficking that is spurred by irregular migration. https://t.co/yyavElmcPh I’m coming up on the @MarkDavis Show on @660KSKY in a few moments. Tune in here: https://t.co/ctm20wFSps Athletes who compete honestly never should have victory seized from them by those who have used performing-enhancing drugs. I introduced the bipartisan Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act to restore a level playing field for all clean U.S. &amp; international athletes. https://t.co/2jotuOMKa7 It was a pleasure to join business and community leaders at the Flower Mound Chamber of Commerce on Friday.  https://t.co/H6IRkcur12 Today #WeRemember the innocent victims and survivors who faced evil, and we honor those who helped shine light in darkness. #HolocaustMemorialDay https://t.co/Hh0j5GarST It was great to meet with @cityofdentontx Mayor Chris Watts in my DC office this week. Mayor Watts and I had a productive conversation about our collaborative efforts on local priorities, including the Lewisville Dam. https://t.co/A5G7EOyAVS President @realDonaldTrump has proven that he values the wellbeing of Americans over petty politics. In the coming days, @SpeakerPelosi should show up and work to find real solutions to defend our nation and provide stability for federal workers. My full statement: https://t.co/HwsToMl5Lg Yesterday it was a privilege to catch up with Capt. Trey Gregory, who I nominated to attend the @NavalAcademy more than a decade ago, at the @uscapitol. Supporting North Texans who answer the call to serve our nation is an important part of my job, and I am grateful to them. https://t.co/HUVF1xQfYF Today I joined President @realDonaldTrump at the @WhiteHouse to discuss the need for fair and balanced #trade that will bolster our economy and protect American workers. My statement: https://t.co/r4Jq7kZ925 It's always a pleasure to join @AmericanCancer at its annual You're Beautiful lunch to celebrate cancer fighters and survivors as America works toward a cure. https://t.co/JeD70gz1o1 Under @SpeakerPelosi's leadership, the House has wasted 330+ hours on political stunts - all while federal employees go without pay. It's past time for @HouseDemocrats to come to the table for good faith negotiations to secure our borders and reopen the federal government. https://t.co/1r5tp3JEuc Today I joined the @SouthwestAir family to celebrate the life of founder Herb Kelleher, who will be long remembered for his dedication to North Texas and his dogged determination to succeed where others could only see failure. https://t.co/SDBdIaouR8 As America marks another anniversary of Roe v. Wade and its tragic consequences, we are reminded that life is a precious and sacred gift, and we must do all we can to protect it. https://t.co/De4YRk8NIz It was a privilege to join @UnitedWayDenton on Saturday to honor my friend Denton County Commissioner Bobbie Mitchell for her more than 30 years of dedicated service to North Texas. https://t.co/ayidLecJZG More than fifty years after his death, Dr. King is remembered as a leader who dedicated his life to working toward justice, equality, and peace for all Americans. We are indebted to him. #MLKDay https://t.co/inuBGDAdet President @realDonaldTrump has shown that he’s willing to come to the table and fulfill his promises to the American people. It’s time for @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats to get serious about reopening the government and securing our borders. This week, I had a productive meeting with @SBAList's Marilyn Musgrave on my work to promote commonsense #prolife policy. The fight for life is a team effort, and I am grateful to all who use their voices to help the most vulnerable among us. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/yirq5SDMk9 As a physician, my career was rooted in the truth that all life has meaningful potential. While my work has changed over the years-I now spend late nights on the House Floor instead of the delivery room-my dedication to #ProLife medicine remains steadfast. https://t.co/aLnnjRDzF4 I agree with President @realDonaldTrump. @SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats should stay in Washington until they reach a deal to reopen the government and secure American borders. https://t.co/9aE6z4qYn0 As I told @trish_regan, it's wrong to expect American taxpayers both to provide foreign aid to Central America and to care for unaccompanied children when they reach our borders. The simple fix? Americans must hold foreign leaders accountable for the well-being of their citizens. https://t.co/0rMw8t7Vls I’m joining @trish_regan at 8pm ET. Tune in for our discussion on the Democrats’ unnecessary shutdown and their obstruction of the resources President @realDonaldTrump needs to defend our nation. It is a privilege to serve as the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, and I am looking forward to leading our @HouseCommerce efforts to expand access to quality care, put patients first, and make health care affordable for the American people. https://t.co/0P8ps5htma Last week the House passed @RepChrisSmith's legislation, which I co-sponsored, to appoint a new Special Envoy at the State Department to address the rise in anti-Semitism worldwide. I hope the Senate advances this bill to @POTUS' desk soon. Former Tarrant County Commissioner Dionne Bagsby was a true trailblazer and dedicated public servant. Her legacy of steadfast service to her fellow North Texans will be long remembered in our community and beyond. https://t.co/RRHhTsSPTH A century after the worst pandemic in our nation's history, the House now has passed the critical #PAHPA reauthorization three times. It's time for the Senate to prioritize the protection of American lives and send this bill to @POTUS' desk. https://t.co/N5yHSIoveF https://t.co/5BRM61u9aF The last Administration clearly failed to fix what President Obama dubbed a humanitarian crisis in 2014. President @realDonaldTrump is committed to securing the southern border, and Congress must ensure he has the resources he needs to defend the nation. https://t.co/tqXjpnE8Me #TBT: In 2014, President @BarackObama met with then-Gov. Rick Perry to discuss the flow of unaccompanied children crossing the southern border, yet refused to visit the border himself. As I've said since then, there's no substitute for showing up. https://t.co/bfRAq6FFqr ICYMI: Yesterday morning I joined @ChrisSalcedoTX to talk about the #116thCongress and the critical need to secure American borders. Catch up here: https://t.co/oUNxP7Drz1 While @HouseDemocrats plan superfluous, symbolic votes, I’ll keep fighting to improve health care for the American people. https://t.co/Z2BCIB7ptH The shutdown should end, and the Democrats should stop their senseless obstruction of the #BorderSecurity we need to defend the nation. https://t.co/gXkTgyk1Jx On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, we honor those who protect and serve. I'm grateful for the law enforcement officers in North Texas, at the @uscapitol, and throughout our nation who prioritize their fellow citizens' safety ahead of their own. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/W4Cw9uiCRL As a Texan, I know firsthand that #BorderSecurity is national security. I joined @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria to discuss President @realDonaldTrump's address to the nation. Watch here: https://t.co/2gHRhfaWDq https://t.co/Q3DzCiHkSq President @realDonaldTrump recognizes the urgent situation on the southern border as the humanitarian and national security crisis it is. Now is the time to #SecureOurBorder. My full statement on the #TrumpAddress: https://t.co/KTDmV6yNmr As I've said for 5 years, there's no substitute for showing up. The brave men and women of @CBP are public servants who know the challenges of the southern border better than anyone in Washington. I encourage @POTUS to ask for their wise counsel as he considers #BorderSecurity. I’ve traveled to #McAllen, TX many times since 2014, and it’s only right for President @realdonaldtrump to see firsthand the urgent situation on the southern border. What the last Administration labeled a humanitarian crisis is now a National Emergency with consequences. https://t.co/dUtWrVs5i3 It is an honor to be appointed to serve on the House Rules Committee for the #116thCongress. I'm looking forward to working alongside Ranking Member @TomColeOK04, @RepRobWoodall, and @RepDLesko on important policy, and I'm grateful to @GOPLeader for the opportunity. My friend @RepLizCheney is a trailblazer and steadfast leader for the people of Wyoming and her fellow Americans. I served with her on @RulesReps last Congress, and I’m grateful to have her at the helm of @HouseGOP as chair of the GOP Conference for the #116thCongress. https://t.co/BjdniSal8Y .@SouthwestAir co-founder Herb Kelleher's legacy includes vast contributions to North Texas &amp; our economy. It was a privilege to work alongside him and others to resolve the impasse known as the “Wright Amendment” several years ago. I'm grateful for his dedication to our region. Despite what House Democrats are saying, the status quo on the southern border is simply unacceptable. As I told @MelissaAFrancis on @FoxBusiness last night, @HouseDemocrats should stop their senseless obstruction of the #bordersecurity that America needs. https://t.co/TEgOST2XnR https://t.co/77wnyvDd9w Think Americans should be paying their fair share in taxes? There’s a flat tax for that. I plan to reintroduce this legislation in the #116thCongress. https://t.co/NgJBzNAvYw Thanks to @HouseGOP and President @realdonaldtrump's pro-growth policies, the economy added 312,000 jobs last month. In the #116thCongress, I'll keep working to improve the economy for hardworking families in North Texas and beyond. https://t.co/JJ7N4yo06P Today I took an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution as I serve the 26th District of Texas in the U.S. House. In the #116thCongress, I'll continue fighting to limit the role of government in Americans’ lives, strengthen national security, and bolster the economy. I’m joining @FoxFriendsFirst bright and early this morning. Tune in at 5:30am ET as we discuss the critical need for #bordersecurity and what the #116thCongress will mean for President @realDonaldTrump’s Administration. Yesterday I kicked off 2019 by swearing in Judge Bonnie Robison at the Denton County Courthouse. Congratulations and thank you for serving, Judge Robison. https://t.co/QgZxRBCPZf As President @realDonaldTrump has said, Democrats are opposing #BorderSecurity for reasons that are purely political. This needs to end. Our national security is far too important for such illogical obstruction. Watch my discussion with @JulieBanderas: https://t.co/Z4iznOPXIg https://t.co/JceuGfxz2L I wish all North Texans a happy and safe New Year. #HappyNewYear In 2018: I authored 18 bills, helped nearly 500 North Texans cut through red tape, gave 80+ media interviews, and traveled more than 6,000 miles in North Texas. Read more here: https://t.co/Zxdr2NTEt3 I was glad to join @FoxNews yesterday morning to discuss the critical need for funding to secure America’s borders. Thanks to @pdoocy for recapping my interview on @OutnumberedFNC. https://t.co/qU0lefKKNF On this day in 1845, #Texas joined the union. As the song says, God bless you Texas! Today I released my 2018 Year End Report, which recaps my work over the past year on behalf of TX-26. Read it here: https://t.co/Zxdr2NTEt3 https://t.co/7rdJKnhaXr #TBT: This summer, I traveled to Central America to learn firsthand about the humanitarian challenges that spur families to send their children on the dangerous journey to reach our southern border. Read more: https://t.co/MSGd1q8mzH I wish all North Texans a merry Christmas and a safe holiday season. https://t.co/E1jz3lkxr4 The defense of our nation must be Congress’ first priority. Period. I urge the Senate to join the House and pass H.R. 695, Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, which includes @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on our southern border &amp; protect the American people. After months of bipartisan, bicameral work, I’m thrilled @POTUS has signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law. For families in North Texas and around the U.S., this law has personal significance and I’m grateful to all who have contributed their voices to this effort. A sovereign nation must define and defend its borders. This morning I joined Lt. Col. @AllenWest on the @MarkDavis Show to discuss my efforts to fund border security in the U.S. House. Listen here: https://t.co/chHGEalk1h Last night in @RulesReps I stood up for President Trump’s priorities and, along with fellow members, delayed consideration of the Senate’s appropriations bill. We must find a path forward for @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on the southern border and defend our nation. As Congress considers important legislation to reform the tax code, we should focus on policies that encourage – not discourage – American workers and our economy. https://t.co/IRcS4reA41 I’m joining @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness in a few moments to discuss a path forward to secure American borders. Last week I visited @CDCgov to learn more about the agency's work on some of the most urgent health care challenges we're facing today, including maternal mortality, influenza, and #AFM. @CDCDirector and his team are working hard to protect the American people. https://t.co/6fNwTypyjS A century after the Spanish Influenza killed nearly 700,000 Americans and millions more worldwide, the Senate must complete its end of the bargain and pass the critical reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. #PAHPA https://t.co/WgtaxaXhw4 President Trump has signed my bill, H.R. 315, into law. The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act will help deliver quality, consistent care to American mothers in North Texas and beyond. I am grateful to all who helped to steward this lifesaving law across the finish line. American health care should put patients first. This morning I joined @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria to discuss the latest ruling on #Obamacare and outline a way forward. https://t.co/CKgFwCBpZo As I’ve said from the beginning, #Obamacare isn’t working for the American people. This ruling will be challenged; nevertheless, Congress should use this opportunity to deliver health reform that puts patients first. Yesterday I had a productive conversation with @CDCgov Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat and @NIAIDNews Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the recent uptick in acute flaccid myelitis (#AFM) cases as @housecommerce #SubHealth tracks its impact on American communities. https://t.co/F4tmnjmhHU After months of bipartisan work to help our nation’s mothers, I’m grateful that the Senate has passed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, sending it to @POTUS' desk to become the law of the land. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this lifesaving legislation. I'm tracking the bomb threats made in North Texas. While thankfully all have been deemed non-credible, remember to stay vigilant. If you see something, say something. https://t.co/lmg7KTxIG8 In case you missed it, my bill to expand critical maternity care is headed to President Trump’s desk. https://t.co/xJm1PqqiQe Today the House passed bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand research and help Americans with sickle cell disease. I’m grateful to @RepDannyDavis, @SenTimScott, &amp; @SenBooker for their partnership on this critical legislation and I encourage @realDonaldTrump to sign it soon. https://t.co/pHjdyJVwIa With today’s passage of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, the House has taken another step toward eliminating all preventable maternal deaths. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this work. Now, the Senate should pass this bill and send it to @POTUS’ desk. https://t.co/GUfgQVjYgM Today on the House Floor, I had the privilege of managing debate for several critical health bills, including initiatives to end maternal mortality, combat sickle cell disease, prevent premature birth, and address traumatic brain injuries. Congress must ensure President Trump has the resources he needs to defend our nation. I’m coming up on @FoxBusiness to discuss. This morning, I will chair the third @housecommerce #SubHealth checkup on the 21st Century Cures Act. Watch here starting at 10:15am ET: https://t.co/UguEL0fAQT I’m heading down to the House Floor to pay tribute to President George H.W. Bush. Tune into @cspan to watch live. Funding the #BorderWall at President @realDonaldTrump's requested level is important. The defense of our nation must be Congress' top priority. Our goal is not to end legal immigration, but rather to provide border security for our citizens. WATCH: https://t.co/bemJL872mn https://t.co/VHU12hG2qg Grateful that, following yesterday's Senate passage, my bill to provide better access to maternity care is headed to President Trump's desk to become the law of the land. https://t.co/De3FVGRDZL On this 77th anniversary of #PearlHarbor, we remember the Americans who perished on that day and our nation's brave response to evil. I am grateful to the #WWII veterans &amp; members of the Greatest Generation who have exemplified love of country and dedication to do what is right. https://t.co/ZwCHoQWfd4 Today marks one year since President @realDonaldTrump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel – fulfilling his promise to the American people and signaling strong support for our friend and ally. This afternoon President George H.W. Bush is being carried to his final resting place at @Bush41Library by a train that bears his name, dubbed the “Air Force One of Railroads.” #Remembering41 #Bush41 https://t.co/VIKzrR2vmR It's an honor to join the Bush family and our fellow Americans to celebrate the exceptional life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush - an American hero, wise statesman, and humble giant among men. #Remembering41 https://t.co/2lUSNOqtwO On Thanksgiving, it was great to see North Texas students representing our region at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Congratulations to the @KellerISD and @NorthwestISD students who participated – all had a fantastic performance. https://t.co/xetJJ4g6Yg This afternoon President George H.W. Bush will arrive at the U.S. Capitol for the final time. After decades of service , President Bush will be just the 12th President to lie in state at the Capitol – a fitting honor for a great American. It was good to talk with @JulieFineNBC5 and @ScottNBC5 late last week for yesterday's edition of Lone Star Politics. In case you missed it, you can catch up with our conversation here: https://t.co/ulTZtfnw7b https://t.co/UxGMNygZHv I wish all those who celebrate a safe and joyous #Hanukkah. https://t.co/NYfzYaDJbq From the skies of the Pacific theater to the Yale baseball diamond to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to the streets of Beijing and the halls of the White House, President @GeorgeHWBush led a life of humble leadership, courage, and conviction. My statement: https://t.co/J8HNDvq74y Along with a grateful nation, I celebrate the life of former President George H.W. Bush, who lived out American values on the front lines of our nation’s history. https://t.co/CD8VxXviLU Thanks to @LizMacDonaldFOX for inviting me to join the @EveningEdit to talk about Congress’ efforts to secure American borders. Our current border fence is simply insufficient. It's time for a real solution. https://t.co/BwsuBUAsbL https://t.co/fnqT1YLvuo The SMART IoT Act, passed by the House this week, will help America stay on the cutting edge of innovation.  https://t.co/XDAoqz1lGn Relieved that my bill, H.R. 315 - the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, has advanced through @GOPHELP. This legislation, passed by the House on 1/9/2017, will improve care for American moms and babies. It's imperative that the Senate take up this bill ASAP. Congratulations to my fellow North Texan @RepKayGranger, the next top Republican of the House Appropriations Committee. I’m coming up on the @ChrisSalcedoTX Show to talk about the critical need to secure American borders. Listen here: https://t.co/sGbXXkqklR I wholeheartedly agree with @bdomenech that @Jack owes @MeghanMcCain and her family an apology for Twitter's glaring mistake earlier this fall. It was the right thing to do in September, and it’s still the right thing to do today. https://t.co/QHY5ivAMnX I’m on the House Floor speaking about legislation under consideration. You can follow along with my remarks on @cspan. I had a productive conversation with @MariaBartiromo this morning about the critical need for border security. As a sovereign nation, America must define and defend its borders. It's time to #BuildTheWall. https://t.co/qshjL5CocT https://t.co/UGFPz0E1qs I will continue to work alongside President @realdonaldtrump to secure America’s borders, restore order at ports of entry, and protect legitimate asylum seekers. Read my full statement on the #migrantcaravan: https://t.co/A6LHfKzj7o Any misconduct in our U.S. Olympics community is simply unacceptable. Earlier this year, @HouseCommerce held a hearing with top Olympics officials. Here are the questions I asked about their plans to keep athletes safe. https://t.co/rxmIaGQy1n ICYMI: It’s a special privilege to represent my fellow North Texans in Congress. Since January 2017, we have accomplished key goals to help Americans continue to succeed – from passing #taxreform to improving #healthcare and more. https://t.co/xgmycTp6Kg As we reflect on the many blessings we enjoy as Americans, I give thanks for each constituent of TX-26.

Good luck to @KellerHighBand. https://t.co/OROw8g74gI This year, @DeptofDefense completed its first-ever audit. After 5 years of working to hold the Pentagon accountable to American taxpayers, I am encouraged to see this step in the right direction. #TBT: Read my #AuditThePentagon oped with @GroverNorquist: https://t.co/9bn5vrDbR2 ICYMI: I joined @FoxNews to offer a path to secure American borders. WATCH: https://t.co/WK1hDiHPgc As I said on @FoxNews yesterday, our rhetoric matters. It is wrong to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our border without the benefit of citizenship. We must hold Central American leaders accountable for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens. https://t.co/9opDOkLWeW I’m monitoring the #AcuteFlaccidMyelitis situation, and appreciate @CDCDirector and @CDCgov's work to find answers for patients and families. https://t.co/B44rINFYRa As Congress seeks to rebuild our Armed Forces, it is more important than ever to ensure that the DOD is working to meet its full potential. My amendment to #AuditThePentagon has been included in the #NDAA since 2015. My statement on @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit: https://t.co/k0Hs5s9HxF The @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit is a step in the right direction. For 5 years, I've been advocating to #AuditThePentagon. Taxpayers should know what we've bought, how much it cost, where it is, whether it's working, and what we need for the future. https://t.co/Tzh3WSl0Rj It was a pleasure to help honor members of America's uniformed service who responded to the communities devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma &amp; Maria. They courageously provided care to those in the wake of the storms for long after the flood waters receded. #JointServices #USPHS https://t.co/hB85vqa2AY On #RuralHealthDay, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all Americans - regardless of where they live - have access to quality care.  https://t.co/zDfzxsHMFa #TBT: As I wrote in @DentonRC earlier this year, a team effort fighting the flu can make a difference for our North Texas community and lead to brighter, healthier days ahead. https://t.co/K0UO680wzJ I'm looking forward to working with @GOPLeader McCarthy, Whip @SteveScalise &amp; Chair @RepLizCheney to keep delivering on our promises to the American people. I was encouraged by the show of unity when Rep. @Jim_Jordan congratulated Leader McCarthy. Now it's time to get to work. Thanks to @dallasnews for sharing these helpful tips about avoiding the #flu. We can all do our part to help protect our family, friends, and North Texas neighbors. https://t.co/MXvGmxbnjC Yesterday I had the privilege of joining students, teachers, and faculty at @McMathMS to pay tribute to North Texas veterans.  #VeteransDay https://t.co/vecWOjheWS Thanks to @MariaBartiromo for inviting me on @FoxBusiness to talk #taxreform, border security, and the outlook for the 116th Congress. https://t.co/N2ZaS6XvXv On #VeteransDay, we honor those in North Texas and beyond who have fought to protect American freedom. Our veterans have made immense sacrifices to serve, and they deserve the upmost respect. It is in the sacrifice and service of our veterans that we see the American spirit. https://t.co/gbKi1NrVlc A century after the end of World War I, we thank those throughout American history who have fought for our freedom. #VeteransDay https://t.co/VhLiZ4ilWH Today marks 243 years of @USMC courage, resolve, and dedication. Thank you for your service on land, sea, and air. #MarineCorpsBirthday https://t.co/gnn0nxS0pv This afternoon, it was an honor to award the Congressional Veteran Commendation to five outstanding North Texas #veterans. Today and every day, I am grateful to those in North Texas and across the nation who have served our country. More: https://t.co/yqERDKU8Xx https://t.co/iHL5Roc63M Throwback: Read more about the Obama Administration’s move to block Americans’ access to an over-the-counter asthma inhaler. #TBT https://t.co/UJ1sFAyWh4 In 2011, President Obama’s EPA banned a widely-used inhaler. Thanks to Dr. @SGottliebFDA + @US_FDA, this over-the-counter medicine has been restored. After years of fighting for this move, I am glad to see this win for American asthma patients. https://t.co/3iazG91Ke0 It is an honor to represent you in Congress, and I look forward to serving North Texas in the 116th Congress. I agree with Senator @JohnCornyn. Thank you for your long service to Alabama, the U.S. Senate, and our country, AG Sessions. https://t.co/dch0UFkgfC Last winter, @SecretaryAcosta came to TX-26 to visit the future home of a North Texas veteran – U.S. Army SPC Daniel Dumas – and his family. I consider the privilege of serving North Texas #veterans one of the most important parts of my job. https://t.co/Rft27lT0X6 America can be compassionate and America can define + defend its borders. It’s time to hold the leaders of Central American countries responsible for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens, and stop the cycle that leads to irregular migration. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH Rep. Sam Johnson, who will retire at the end of the 115th Congress, spent nearly seven years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In February, I spoke on the House Floor in honor of my fellow Texan's 45th "Returniversary." @SamsPressShop https://t.co/8XIfpLStO0 Less than a year after President @realDonaldTrump signed #taxreform into law, we’ve experienced record-breaking economic growth. In October, our economy added 250,000 jobs. https://t.co/VYmDMmXGKi American consumers should know how @facebook uses their data. In April, I had the opportunity to ask Mark Zuckerberg. WATCH our conversation here: https://t.co/9eDYgcn3kT Over the summer, I had the privilege of joining North Texan Sadie Keller and President @RealDonaldTrump at the White House for the signing of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. WATCH my remarks from the Oval Office. https://t.co/ksOH8bjJWu The U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs in October. Coupled with the biggest wage increase in a decade (3.1 percent) and the lowest unemployment since 1969 (3.7 percent), this #JobsReport indicates encouraging growth for North Texans and all Americans. https://t.co/VYmDMmXGKi Earlier this year, Texans and Americans across the country mourned the loss of former First Lady Barbara Bush – an incredible role model for patriotism, compassion, and courage to always do what is right. WATCH my tribute to her on the House Floor. https://t.co/Dcx1nYZkKu BIG: Contrary to what you may hear in the news, there is a greater percentage of Americans in employer health coverage today than at any time since 2000. Here's what that means for Americans with #PreExistingConditions. https://t.co/rLq3Fbk2ZN I'm sorry to learn of the loss of @HHSgov's Dan Best - a committed partner in @housecommerce and Congress' work to improve health care for the American people. My prayers are with Dan's family, friends, and the HHS community at this difficult time. As caravans from Central America travel to our southern border, we must address the cycle of poverty, violence, and corruption that leads families to leave their home countries. Here’s a real solution. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH Last week, President Trump signed #HR6 into law – culminating months of bipartisan work to combat our nation’s #opioidcrisis. WATCH my remarks on this landmark bill before we sent it to President @realDonaldTrump's desk: https://t.co/tsNpmcFMVI There’s nothing scary about this news – Wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase in a decade. Thanks to #taxreform, our economy is finally working for the American people. https://t.co/YagNABSv73 As #HealthCare trends in the news, it’s time to set the record straight on #preexistingconditions. @HouseGOP is committed to creating a fair system in which ALL patients are protected. Watch my full remarks: https://t.co/P35mbJreSi https://t.co/IOPGHGmVH6 THROWBACK: Earlier this year, Senate Democrats shut down the federal government to hold up funding for #CHIP – a program upon which millions of American families rely. While the government was shut down, I headed down to the Floor to correct the record. https://t.co/6H7AVqLH4U As 2018 comes to a close, I am working on compiling this year's Year End Report [read last year's here: https://t.co/HyXuYCh0AM]. Over the next few weeks, we'll take a look back at some of my work to serve North Texas. In the midst of this tragedy, the American people must come together for the sake of our neighbors in #Pittsburgh, in North Texas, and around the country. Together, we can build a better future for generations of Americans yet to come. /4 We must commit to working together, listening to one another, and reaffirming our belief that each person has been created and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. /3 The U.S. Constitution guarantees a number of unalienable rights, including the freedom to practice the religion of one’s choice - a core tenant of our American democracy. In the United States of America, no one should be afraid of worshiping freely.  /2 This week, I join my fellow Americans in mourning the eleven innocent lives taken needlessly in the #SquirrelHill attack - an act of pure evil.  /1 https://t.co/tEeNUYaBYq https://t.co/Lpqz43ZYp5 Each week, I send a video update on my work to serve North Texas.

In July, I went to the House Floor to discuss the situation on our southern border and trace the roots of this crisis. #TBT https://t.co/V4KHbhv0YC It's been a privilege to help steward life-saving legislation that will touch every facet of our nation's #opioidcrisis. It is my hope that our efforts will spare any additional families from the devastation of opioid addiction and provide hope to communities across America. https://t.co/cmJjBC8yeB This afternoon, I am looking forward to joining @realDonaldTrump as he signs #HR6 into law - culminating the hard work of #SubHealth, @HouseCommerce and @HouseGOP to get this life-saving legislation across the finish line and deliver results to the American people. .@VP is correct. Violence - against elected officials, the media, or any other human being - is always inherently wrong and absolutely unacceptable. Period. Those responsible for these cowardly attempted attacks must be brought to justice. https://t.co/T0qgbAazom We cannot expect American taxpayers to both 1) provide foreign assistance for Central American countries and 2) provide care for unaccompanied children who cross our border. If we keep doing what we've been doing, nothing will change. It's time to act. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH I support President @realDonaldTrump's efforts to define + defend American borders. Despite the cable news criticism of this strategy, it is the best path forward. If @realdonaldtrump wants Congress to take up this endeavor, there’s a Burgess bill waiting. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH President @realdonaldtrump is expected to sign #HR6 into law this week, furthering our fight against the #CrisisNextDoor. This bill, a culmination of months of bipartisan work, will help families affected by opioid abuse in North Texas and across the U.S. https://t.co/gnRKGj2hIR Foreign aid can be a powerful motivator for the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala &amp; #Honduras. We should ensure that American assistance given to these countries is redirected to organizations working to address the circumstances that spur people to leave. https://t.co/X5XRQXmnUp https://t.co/RR7T0sYUfr Over the summer, I traveled to Honduras to meet with local officials and learn firsthand about the corruption, poverty, and violence that is spurring families to leave. To end this cycle, we must hold Central American leaders accountable. MORE: https://t.co/vPRSQyWW0K https://t.co/v2VDuj1fPG .@dallasnews didn't get quite the whole story. If we keep doing what we've been doing, we'll keep getting what we've been getting. The leaders of El Salvador, Honduras + Guatemala need to step up and take responsibility for their people. My solution: https://t.co/lqoEixbeTN https://t.co/6cdS7c8Yob We must hold the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the wellbeing of their people. That’s why I’ve been introducing the Unaccompanied Alien Children Assistance Control Act since July 2014. https://t.co/WAZhed4qXa America’s foreign aid funds are much better spent helping to build a better life for children in these Central American countries than caring for them in HHS-ORR shelters once they reach our border. For things to change, we must act. President @realdonaldtrump is on the right track. To break this cycle, we must end the status quo. There’s a Burgess bill for that --&gt; https://t.co/lqoEixbeTN https://t.co/4Xxw7L1uAm Do not be fooled: Anyone who says that House Democrats’ government-run #healthcare bill will allow individuals to keep their private health insurance is lying to the American people. https://t.co/AhxN1QRGrA https://t.co/hONhkTB1O8 Eliminating preventable maternal mortality should be a goal for all Americans. Recently, I chaired a @HouseCommerce #SubHealth hearing with families and experts on the front line of this issue. MORE: https://t.co/eWiUGdXGB0 https://t.co/OHfc0Z0Mys Today marks 243 years of @USNavy excellence. Thank you to all our Sailors who serve to defend our nation. https://t.co/jJqSNzbpQN I am relieved that Pastor Brunson has been released at last. His daughter, Jacqueline Furnari, provided compelling testimony about their experience at a @HelsinkiComm hearing last year. This is long overdue. https://t.co/VjP4SKari1 Happy birthday to my friend and fellow North Texan Congressman Sam Johnson. https://t.co/4ShUzNO71V ICYMI: The @dallasnews published an editorial highlighting Congress’ bipartisan work to combat the opioid crisis in Texas and around the country. We expect President @realDonaldTrump to sign H.R. 6 into law soon. https://t.co/jqq6CDiYUF Today President @realdonaldtrump signed a bill into law that will eliminate “gag clauses” at the pharmacy, improving transparency and helping to lower drug prices for the American people. https://t.co/7o4f0F2hFR From provisions included in the 21st Century Cures Act to our latest work in H.R. 6 to address the #opioidcrisis, @housecommerce #SubHealth has prioritized helping individuals and families affected by mental health and/or substance use disorders find the support they need. On #WorldMentalHealthDay, I reaffirm my commitment to help North Texans and Americans across the country access quality mental health care. For those in need, @samhsagov has a free, confidential 24/7 help line: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). https://t.co/Hu3k0U4luw Great news for our North Texas community - This year the @EPA recognized @CityOfFriscoTx for excellence in education and outreach in its commitment to water efficiency. https://t.co/t0IceoiRKj The #opioidcrisis has taken a toll on neighborhoods in North Texas and around the country. It has been a privilege to help steward the life-saving solutions of H.R. 6 from @HouseCommerce #SubHealth to @realDonaldTrump’s desk. https://t.co/jqq6CDiYUF Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a qualified jurist who will uphold the original interpretation of the U.S. Constitution as the Framers intended. My statement on the Senate confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the #SCOTUS: https://t.co/H4mAOx1PZe Thanks to President @realdonaldtrump and @HouseGOP, in September the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent for the first time since 1969. Since January of last year, the economy has added more than 3.8 million jobs. This is good news for North Texans and all Americans. In September 2018, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent for the first time since 1969. For perspective, the last time the unemployment rate was this low, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, the Beatles released “Abbey Road, ” and I was a student at @UNTnews. As I told @MariaBartiromo yesterday morning, the people of Texas and Americans around the country are ready for this cruel process to end. It's time for the Senate to complete its work on the #SCOTUS nomination. https://t.co/AQPwxO8h3e Those who travel to our border without citizenship face a perilous journey through the desert. Our foreign aid funds are much better spent helping to provide a safe home for children in Central American countries than spent caring for them in taxpayer-funded shelters in the U.S. https://t.co/17xVBfnfWo Thanks @MariaBartiromo for having me on @FoxBusiness to talk about our nation’s immigration crisis. If we are ever to end the cycle of poverty and corruption in the Central American countries from which many  travel to the U.S. border, we must change our course of action. https://t.co/IC11GFeG95 From #SubHealth to @HouseCommerce to the House of Representatives and now the Senate, the life-saving H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, is at last headed to @realDonaldTrump's desk to become the law of the land. https://t.co/IHcb3NDs3j
