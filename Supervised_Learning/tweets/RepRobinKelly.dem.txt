Thank you to @HouseJudiciary Chairman @RepJerryNadler for moving so quickly on this commonsense &amp; broadly supported bill to ensure a background check on ALL gun sales. For too long, these lenders have preyed on low-income families and helped keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty. While these lenders might have their place, we need STRONG rules governing their conduct and SEVERE punishments for breaking the rules. https://t.co/Ccb8k51lun RT @HouseJudiciary: Yesterday, @HouseJudiciary held the first gun violence prevention hearing in nearly a decade.

@HouseDemocrats are already getting to work #ForThePeople. I stand with our scientists. #Climatechange is real, man-made and dangerous. @POTUS seems to be confused by the difference between ‘weather’ and ‘climate;’ maybe he should read his briefing memos. https://t.co/4zAOZ50Ofo I have the highest level of respect for the men and women of our intelligence services.

It’s time to pass #HR8 and begin working to end this public safety crisis.
https://t.co/cjzMbm60Ql I agree. If nothing else, it’s a perfect example of the most important civics lesson: elections have consequences. https://t.co/FH5yVHeBFr .@POTUS FINALLY came to the table in a responsible manner to join @HouseDemocrats in ending his #TrumpShutdown.

This is a sad example of why Congress MUST work to make healthcare more affordable and accessible. https://t.co/s3I6xLVN9C Tragically, America has seen another mass shooting.

China isn’t buying American #soybeans and Illinois farmers are still suffering because of the failed #TrumpTradeWar. https://t.co/8Fy8onhhhC I’m disappointed to learn that many of my neighbors are being exposed to unsafe levels of manganese. We need swift &amp; immediate corrective action, coupled with real accountability. https://t.co/AqFrbsIM6y During @SpeakerRyan's short three year tenure, the annual federal deficit increased by $343 billion. https://t.co/CuZsKu2eYx Each year, more than 70,0000 Illinoisans are provided lifesaving health services by Planned Parenthood. #SCOTUS made the right decision and will preserve this healthcare access for thousands of Illinois families. https://t.co/1lojvrWtEJ At 6pm CST, I’m joining @Lily_NEA, @rweingarten &amp; @AMarch4OurLives for a #ProtectOurSchools conversation about schools and gun safety.  Hope you can tune in: https://t.co/47fUWzLYnV I’m very glad that the House will vote on the bipartisan #act2savemoms (HR 1318) this week. This bill is an important step toward addressing #maternalmortality but Congress can and must do more: #MOMMAact. Sadly, this weekend we lost Rosanell Eaton, the Queen Mother of #VotingRights. 

It’s past time to honor her and other voting rights crusaders by passing the #VRAA, because every American should be able to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/LTWapvO5PP These 44 former Senators from both parties are right. Congress must stand up, push back and defend our democracy against ALL enemies, foreign and domestic. https://t.co/qe5vWStn8Z Bipartisanship in Congress is possible. I’m proud to have worked with @CongMikeSimpson and Members from both parties to pass this important dental and oral health access bill. https://t.co/6a49yPD9WD .@VotingMomIL - We must address the illegal firearm trafficking that happens every day. We have bipartisan legislation (#HR1457) ready to go w/ 83 co-sponsors. We need @GOPLeader to call this commonsense, bipartisan, law enforcement-backed bill before the end of THIS Congress. https://t.co/0ilgrS9QxO Already have health insurance through the exchange? Did you know that you can use the #OpenEnrollment period to shop around for a better or cheaper plan? Be sure to get all your shopping done by Saturday’s deadline. https://t.co/X5Vp8pEejG Money in politics is a poison. Elected officials should work for American families, not their corporate donors. It’s past time for Congress to pass a #ForThePeople agenda that makes politicians accountable to voters, not donors. https://t.co/nEAIyW9F1k On the 70th #HumanRightsDay, we recommit ourselves to the unifying belief that all people are created equal. No matter who you are, where you live, who you love, what you look like or what religion you practice, you are a person of dignity and worth. REMINDER: #OpenEnrollment ends on Saturday! Be sure to visit https://t.co/TjlC3DNgHC before the deadline to sign up for quality, affordable health insurance for 2019. https://t.co/no8IXxwRgQ .@NurseGuide_yc, thanks for reaching out. I’m always happy to try and meet with constituents whenever possible. As a Second District resident, you can always call me at 708.679.0773; meetings can also be requested online. Hope to chat soon! https://t.co/4ZRt2JbrUa https://t.co/VbgVW7DkVz Looking forward to welcoming constituents to my new office – Rayburn 2416! Come and visit us when you are in Washington, D.C. https://t.co/beDVOVa8uy President @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care about the massive national debt he’s creating that our children and grandchildren will be left to pay off. But, I care about his massive debt and I know our kids and grandkids care too. https://t.co/d7YueAPLvP 16 months ago, I released the first discussion draft of my #InternetOfThings bill. After hundreds of comments from advocates, industry and policymakers, we have a final #cybersecurity bill that will be introduced next week. https://t.co/wIK13E0AOG Today, I join my colleagues and millions of others from around the globe in saying goodbye to President George H. W. Bush. 41’s legacy will remain his enduring love of family, nation, civility and humanity. #OpenEnrollment ends on December 15th. Be sure to sign up and #GetCovered at https://t.co/TjlC3DNgHC. https://t.co/Xvm3JzYoK9 Our doctors, nurses &amp; health professionals treat people w/ gunshot wounds. Many patients do not survive; others are left w/ a lifetime of scars. We can reduce and stop these tragedies by allowing public health professionals to do their jobs #ThisISOurLane https://t.co/PywefMg2Jj #OTD in 1969, we lost Fred Hampton. Fred, 21, boldly spoke to the need for a multiracial coalition to stand up, speak out and fight back against the abuses of those in positions of power. Today, we remember his legacy and call #IAmARevolutionary. https://t.co/SqowmxLzn0 Happy #FoundersDay to the brothers of @apa1906NETwork. For 112 years, AΦA has promoted leadership, brotherhood, academic excellence, community service and advocacy - our country and world are a better place because of it. Happy birthday Illinois! #OTD in 1818, Illinois joined the union. Chag Chanukah sameach to all those celebrating in Chicagoland and around the world. https://t.co/SSKbQLhQbE Thank you to @accesshealth for providing this vital service and so many others to our community. https://t.co/BBMMmYC1SX Today is #WorldAIDSDay so I’m taking the test. Everyone has an HIV status, know yours! #KnowYourStatus https://t.co/x6xZiGgkvp Sad to learn of the passing of President George H. W. Bush. He was a man of principles, patriotism and civility. My heart is with his family at this difficult time. Very excited to pass my second bipartisan bill of the week. On Wednesday, the House passed my Action for Dental Health Act and today, our federal CIO bill was approved. https://t.co/8eRXkxZp3a Early this week, my friend, Senator @MazieHirono, introduced the Senate version of the Health Equity and Accountability Act. This comprehensive bill is aimed at ending the lingering health disparities that still plague American communities. #HEAA https://t.co/AqL6AcIqYq #MaternalMortality is a preventable tragedy. My #MOMMAact has specialized language to address the shocking fact that African American women are THREE-to-FOUR TIMES more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth. https://t.co/99B7kwjtgy Every day, more than 90 Americans are shot and killed. Another nearly 250 are shot and survive. These are their stories of struggle, survival, despair, hope and challenge: https://t.co/wmTgweKqH6 At 2:15pm, my colleagues and I are joining doctors from around the country to demand lifesaving action on #gunviolence, including background checks, research funding and expanded NICS participation. #ThisISOurLane https://t.co/VJH9Zclwhb Thank you @CongMikeSimpson for working with me on this. Your expertise, leadership and partnership were so important and it means more Americans will have more access to #dentalhealth. #BipartisanshipFTW! https://t.co/qNaSchFZNd Correction: Since there was no objection to passing this important bill, it passed on a voice vote! Onward to @POTUS' desk! https://t.co/fLNMg8yFT4 On the House floor to debate my bipartisan Action for Dental Health Act; we will vote on it tomorrow. Looking forward to sending this important healthcare access bill to @POTUS’ desk. #HR2422
