Because of the sensitive nature of this case, we aren’t able to share specific details. I would like to thank everyone that reached out to my office to let us know about the situation. My office was made aware of an issue early this morning regarding a  constituent from Perrysburg who is overseas and is unable to return. We  have reached out to the appropriate governmental agencies to see what  can be done to find a resolution. Marcia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Debbie and family on the passing of John. John epitomized public service in always placing the people of Michigan before himself. He was passionate in all he did and has left a lasting legacy on the US House. He will be sorely missed. https://t.co/FVFJqGE09t RT @jimmphillipsdc: Top @HouseCommerce Republicans @repgregwalden, @boblatta and @cathymcmorris file #NetNeutrality legislation aimed at re… .@cathymcmorris and @repgregwalden have also introduced legislation to ensure a free and open Internet. If Democrats are interested in finding a legislative solution to this contentious issue, the door is open. I’ve introduced a bill that would do just that and believe it can gather bipartisan support. In fact, it is essentially the same legislation that former Democratic E&amp;C Chairman Henry Waxman authored in 2010. When Congress passed Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, people were using phones like this one; technology has a changed a bit since then.

After yrs of debate, it's time to pass legislation to ensure #NetNeutrality principles w/o using the burdensome #TitleII framework https://t.co/b0MGQM3UKD .@SteveScalise is a colleague + friend who was shot and seriously wounded in 2017.
