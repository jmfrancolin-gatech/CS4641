R.I.P. Congressman John Dingell. My condolences to @RepDebDingell and the rest of John’s family. A legend on the Energy and Commerce Committee he will be missed. That is why I will be working alongside my fellow pro-life colleagues in the House to end the barbaric practice of infanticide by providing life-saving treatment to babies that survive an attempted abortion by supporting the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I am deeply troubled by recent efforts in New York and Virginia to legalize abortion up until the moment of delivery and beyond. I support President Trump’s call to “reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.” RT @allianceinh2o: NRWA DC Rally meetings continue! Meeting with Congressman Buschon. @RepLarryBucshon @NRWA @KellyCordell12 
#RuralWater #… The fact that Speaker Pelosi didn’t stand and applaud with Republicans and a few Democrats when President Trump said the U.S. will never be a socialist country is very telling. Shocking really. I stand ready to work with President Trump and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the tough decisions needed to help all Americans in the pursuit of their version of the American dream. #SOTU https://t.co/WkMKFONvPA I applaud @realDonaldTrump’s determination to protect American interests. Foreign threats serve to harm the United States but also to the peace and security of the entire world. #NationalSecurity #SOTU During my work on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, I continually focused on private sector, market-based solutions that lower costs and will make healthcare more accessible and affordable to all.  I look forward to sharing those solutions with @realDonaldTrump.  #SOTU As a physician, I look forward to partnering with the @WhiteHouse to deliver real health care reform that drives down the cost of health care, increases the quality of care, and expands access. #AccessforAll
#SOTU I applaud @realDonaldTrump for working to address China’s unfair trade practices. It is critical that we support and protect American jobs and workers. #ProtectAmericanJobs #SOTU Every day, more than 100 Americans die from drug related overdoses. The drugs flowing from our southern border have created a national security crisis that threatens the American people. #DrugEpidemic #SOTU We must come together as a united government to prioritize the safety and security of the American people. It is time to secure our southern border and our nation. #SecuretheBorder #SOTU Virginia Governor Northam should resign. There is no place in our society for racism in any form. The picture from his Medical School yearbook is indefensible. The US economy added 304,000 jobs in January, and throughout 2018, the average monthly gain was 223,000 jobs. This economic boom is no coincidence, it is the direct product of the pro-growth policies put in place by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress Thanks to a conservative agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations to empower Main Street job creators, January marks a record-breaking 100th straight month of job gains. https://t.co/aaATlwjeU3 An unreliable and non-resilient electrical grid that cannot meet all the energy needs of Americans and our economy not only puts consumers’ safety at risk, but it also puts our national security in jeopardy.
https://t.co/STYKaflwYI https://t.co/TFi4j6jJgI The extreme cold rolling through the country is not to be taken lightly. Please prepare and make sure you are being proactive to protect you and your family. https://t.co/nIC00ghP23 If Senator Harris and Washington Democrats get their way and complete this total government takeover of health care, your access to treatment will be solely at the mercy of Washington bureaucrats. It will also eliminate the health care for millions of Americans – including 158 million Americans who get their coverage through their employer. https://t.co/HHReSVMEoc Medicare for All will end Medicare as we know it, leaving the health care of millions of seniors in jeopardy. If Speaker Pelosi really believes what she told Congress and the American people last year when she said, ‘As Members of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers,’ then she would put forth the President’s proposal for a vote in the House tomorrow. and it also contained a legislative solution to provide legal protection for 700,00 DACA recipients and 300,000 Temporary Protected Status recipients sought by Democrats in Congress. It contains $5.7 billion for additional personnel and a physical barrier to secure our southern border sought by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, This week, President Trump proposed a commonsense proposal to secure our border and end this needless government shutdown. During this speech, she said ‘there is nothing partisan or political about protecting DREAMers.’ However, with the Speaker’s gavel back in hand, she has seemingly changed her mind, putting her political agenda before the DREAMers she so passionately urged the Congress to protect. Almost a year ago, Speaker Pelosi spoke on the House floor for more than eight hours about the importance of bringing a legislative solution for recipients of the  Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program. 
https://t.co/SihtgS4L2Y https://t.co/lxvdbuJ4cR RT @GOPLeader: Retweet if you agree that the State of the Union should proceed as planned. I just signed and submitted a resolution that wo… Enough is enough. Democrats must come to the table, put forth legislation that the President will sign and end this politically charged shutdown. Democrats are once again standing between federal employees on furlough as well as those that continue to show up for work each day and their paychecks. I just voted to pay all federal employees that have been furloughed and those that have continued to work without pay throughout the duration of this partial government shutdown that started on December 22. Democrats in the House blocked it. Today at the University of Southern Indiana’s annual MLK Day luncheon in Evansville. Pictured with Mayor Lloyd Winneke, his wife Carol McClintock and USI President Ronald Rochon. https://t.co/1QdBrWczaa This bill will help create more clean, American-made energy and jobs while also preserving environmental standards. Prior to my bill becoming law, many projects never even got off the drawing board because it could take over a decade of navigating the federal permitting process before a project could even begin. Last Congress I authored a bill that was signed into law by President Trump expediting the process to turn existing dams into hydro-powered dams. #ICYMI: https://t.co/jGhId9Uyuc President Trump outlined today a common sense, reasonable offer to end the shutdown. This includes investment in border security to end the border crisis and addresses DACA and TPS. These are programs which Dems have said are priorities to them. Dems stop playing 2020 politics. I urge the Democrats to end the political gamesmanship and to stop holding the government hostage, come to the table to secure our nation, and pass a bill that the Senate and President Trump will sign. Instead of helping thousands of federal employees – many of whom are working without pay – to get their paychecks, House Democrats voted against this proposal and to deny federal employees their paychecks. This limited proposal would not reopen the government without addressing the crisis at our Southwest border, but it would bring relief to federal employees who have missed their first paycheck of the year. Today, House Republicans brought a proposal to the floor to allow federal employees affected by the government shutdown to receive their first paycheck of the year. I support @GOPLeader McCarthy’s decision not to seat Rep. Steve King on any committees for the 116th Congress. There is absolutely no place in America for racism, and his views do not reflect those of the Republican party. Our law enforcement personnel go to work every day and selflessly put themselves on the line to protect our families, our communities, and our nation. Thank you for all you do. https://t.co/yJp1CfoWph Border Facts: Each day, immigrants arrive at the southern border that have been assaulted or harmed on their way, or are in need of emergency medical care due to a serious medical condition. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/efTt7VrgDm The crisis along our southern border has gone on too long.
