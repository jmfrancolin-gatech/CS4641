We remember so the world never forgets the evils unleashed by anti-Semitism and hatred, and to remain steadfast against these threats. https://t.co/QGtmE7AldN Thank you @MomsDemand for coming by the office today. I was proud to co-sponsor H.R 8, bipartisan legislation to close loopholes in our background check system, earlier this month. After years of inaction, we have to act on gun safety in this Congress. https://t.co/JWh1MkaUa5 It's a shame so many had to needlessly suffer without paychecks for Pres. Trump to come to come to this realization. 

The men &amp; women of the Coast Guard, TSA, FAA, CBP, FBI, &amp; other agencies who continued to do their duty and work unpaid on our behalf deserve our gratitude. As I have said from day one, the path out of this shutdown is straightforward: re-open the government, pay our federal workers, and then we can have an honest, open debate about the best way to secure our border without using the livelihoods of thousands of families for leverage. After 35 long days, I am relieved that common sense has finally prevailed and President Trump has agreed to end his unnecessary and damaging government shutdown. #EndTheShutdown After President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, I led a resolution condemning the decision and praising the states and cities that stepped forward to maintain carbon reduction commitments. I'm glad that Illinois is now among group committed to #ActOnClimate https://t.co/jvLXRSIwA8 When the men and women serving the public in the Coast Guard, TSA, FAA, CBP, and other agencies go unpaid it hurts our safety, security, and local communities.

Then, when our government is re-opened, we can have an honest, open debate about the best way to secure our border. Some are struggling to make ends meet. These are the men and women who help keep our food and flights safe, environment healthy, financial markets fair, and borders secure. They are our neighbors, not pawns for the President’s political battles. Today, I met with local federal workers and their families who are bearing the brunt of President Trump’s decision to shut down our government, including employees at the FAA, EPA, SEC, and CPB who are working without pay or furloughed. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/1x7d6Dxm1T I am proud to introduce this legislation with support from both sides of the aisle w/ @RepKenMarchant @RepTerriSewell and @RepJasonSmith during January, National Slavery &amp; Human Trafficking Prevention Month https://t.co/JLkkBWATeC Survivors of human trafficking need our support as they rebuild their lives.

My message to the President: stop holding these workers hostage and re-open the government. #EndtheShutdown Flying to Washington yesterday I met a TSA agent working without pay because of shutdown. She is a single mother raising a 15 year-old daughter, &amp; her family is struggling to make ends meet without her paycheck. #ShutdownStories Congratulations to our new Governor J.B.

Answer: hurricane victims, apparently. https://t.co/VQnaiJvAIU Today, I introduced legislation with @RepCasten to make sure that senior staff are not rewarded with raises while the Administration’s inaction perpetuates a shutdown that keeps hard-working federal employees without pay. https://t.co/OgXbR02OOT Federal workers are already bearing the brunt of President Trump’s shutdown. Doling out raises to political appointees in the Administration while working families go without pay just adds insult to injury. Today thousands are missing a paycheck because Pres.

I can't in good conscience accept pay while so many hardworking federal employees are forced to go without. https://t.co/aA4NUmFa4A I am proud the House passed our bill overwhelmingly today to fill the vacant Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism position.

Wonderful to see young people thanking our veterans for their service. https://t.co/AIJaXkcLP7 I was glad to stop by and make some new friends at the North Chicago Public Library 90th anniversary celebration. Here’s to many more years serving the community! @ncplibrary https://t.co/8RFEBLU9P7 We reject anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and all forms of hate, and embrace every American’s right to freely practice their faith. We will not be bowed by hate. This Shabbat, I will be joining millions of Jewish-Americans, and Americans of all faiths, to worship and to honor the memory of the 11 innocents murdered in a Pittsburgh Synagogue. Here's a link to the letter I sent with @SenatorDurbin and @SenDuckworth to EPA: https://t.co/orZrm2toAw We must also ensure EPA’s regulations reflect the most up-to-date research and public health data on the dangers of ethylene oxide and other industrial chemicals. Additionally, the EPA needs to take steps to embrace transparency by making all test data publicly available and holding a public meeting so residents have confidence in the safety of their community. Every family deserves safe breathing air, and we need enforceable environmental standards to guarantee our public health. I’m seeking more information &amp; monitoring of these facilities in Waukegan &amp; Gurnee to get the facts and reduce emissions to non-threatening levels. https://t.co/k1PFEDUiKm I was proud to join the Walk to End Alzheimer's last month in our district, and will continue to support federal research efforts at National Institutes of Health (NIH) toward a cure. #EndAlz November is Alzheimer's Awareness Month, and I'm thinking of the 5 million Americans suffering from this terrible disease, and the 10 million Americans caring for a loved one. #EndAlz https://t.co/FYnfpqaNT6 Open enrollment in https://t.co/lyYZkEv3N5 starts today! Make sure you #GetCovered before December 15. https://t.co/eIzHdE24l7 https://t.co/ooFFWXwt4x Congress must respond to threat of dangerous extremism: that’s why I introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act with @SenatorDurbin &amp; others to ensure federal agencies are vigilant and coordinated in tracking and preventing these heinous acts.
  https://t.co/LF2cODuefi Visiting a drop off location for unused prescription medication at Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital. I encourage you to find a #NationalTakeBack site near you at https://t.co/dsIRucfyaO https://t.co/bGN2SDytcb My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, but we must do more. We must unite as one nation to condemn hate in all forms, including anti-Semitism. And we must stand together as one nation to tell those who act in hate that we will not be bowed by fear. I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of life at the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, inspired by the heroic actions of our first responders, and frustrated by the inability of our nation to keep our houses of worship, our schools, and our public squares safe from senseless violence. Solar and other renewable sources of energy are not just necessary to reduce emissions and address global climate change, they are also job creators! #BradAtYourBusiness I visited Certasun in Buffalo Grove, a home solar company serving the Chicagoland area and also toured a nearby home where they recently installed panels. #BradAtYourBusiness https://t.co/1Mnf0Kppa1 Did you know a majority of abused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet? This Saturday, dispose of your unused medications at a #TakeBackDay event. Find a site near you: https://t.co/dsIRucx9zo https://t.co/JuNNh6RMTy I’m grateful for the professionalism of the Secret Service, Capitol Police, USPS, and other members of law enforcement who intercepted these packages. These heinous acts of political violence targeting public servants, the media, and activists deserve to be condemned by all. We are a stronger country when we are united. 

https://t.co/uDqG8n1cqV Great visit to Startek in Gurnee, which employs more than a dozen workers designing &amp; manufacturing LED lighting. Thank you for inviting me to visit and sharing your perspective on how Congress can create the conditions for more small businesses to succeed. #BradAtYourBusiness https://t.co/G5g62X2NgE Their upcoming schedule here: https://t.co/Yl5CxeyvCB I visited the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois mobile unit during their stop today in Waukegan. They offer free prevention education and health screenings for kidney disease, high blood pressure and diabetes to Illinois communities.  @IllinoisKidney https://t.co/0udXcGifs6 We will not be silent as the Trump Administration seeks to rollback federal civil rights protections for transgender Americans and weaken enforcement of non-discrimination laws. https://t.co/tjOUt1mc0W Great costumes over the weekend at the North Suburban YMCA - Northbrook Halloween Spooktacular! @nsymca https://t.co/S6VTjp6DPJ I joined volunteers at Growing Healthy Veterans constructing a "Hoop House" greenhouse in Gurnee this weekend The organization works to engage veterans in agricultural projects to enhance their physical health, overall wellness, and that of their families and communities. https://t.co/SUjLhpuJ4A I was glad to join the Exchange Club of Grayslake for their annual pancake breakfast and support their service on the community. Also caught up with WRLR 98.3FM. https://t.co/EHgbB0iczT Our office worked with John Wensch of Winthrop Harbor to acquire medals that his late father, a World War II veteran, earned in the Pacific Theater. I'm grateful for the service of John's father, and glad we could help honor his memory in this way. https://t.co/OvaGALctvd Proud to announce that my legislative record on #LGBTQ equality issues has earned a 100 percent score from Human Rights Campaign. I will continue to stand up to efforts to undermine these hard fought rights or discriminate against people because of who they are or who they love. https://t.co/7VnAGqFWZF This was one of the many reasons I voted NO on tax bill. Because it would explode our debt &amp; be used as cynical justification to cut SS, Medicare, &amp; other vital programs that millions of Americans depend on. These programs are a commitment to our seniors, and one we must uphold. https://t.co/i45kwSMP5s I was glad to be in Round Lake for the annual chili supper to support Round Lake Area BEST and Round Lake Area Exchange Club. https://t.co/unrenKx7vC With some of the constituents at this afternoon’s #NeighborhoodOfficeHours at Deerfield Public Library. https://t.co/1grlH2buTL I was glad to visit Lake Co Tech Campus last week to learn more about the career and technical education training opportunities available to students. They young people here are gaining the #STEM skills and hands-on experiences to succeed in a 21st century economy. @LCTechCampus https://t.co/2s3luFnpqb Today is the 20th anniversary of the death of #MatthewShepard. I am proud to cosponsor a resolution to honor Matthew and affirm Congress’ continued support for preventing hate crimes. We must continue working to advance equality for all #LGBTQ Americans. https://t.co/4zrIvaoWxY So many of our debates about immigration are based in overheated rhetoric instead of fact. The truth is immigration helps grow the economy &amp; makes our country stronger, which is why I'll continue to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. 

https://t.co/eGBcDmtke9 Today, I joined a letter urging Governor Rauner to address the damage of this new law on Illinois taxpayers and explore options for relief as other states have done, including New Jersey, New York, and California. https://t.co/OUByfnKYij The new tax bill’s restriction of the SALT deduction is punishing for Illinois families – particularly when our state already pays more in federal taxes than we receive back in benefits. The strength of the US-Israel relationship lies in the broad bipartisan support for our close ally. My Democratic colleagues and I are committed to protecting our partnership with Israel, and I will continue to always advocate for further cooperation between our two nations. I was glad to join local business leaders and Mayor @NancyRotering at the Business Summit in @CityHPIL https://t.co/5A55Rhgi9h I joined this letter to President Trump because the United States needs to push for answers from the governments of Saudi Arabia and Turkey on #JamalKhashoggi. We cannot remain silent when journalists are targeted. https://t.co/8psqpAPF5B A little rain didn’t stop people from enjoying The Great Highwood Pumpkin Festival this weekend.@HighwoodEvents https://t.co/VhuYKyFJje Talking with constituents at our most recent #CongressonYourCorner in Highwood. This is our 28th so far this term. Thanks Highwood Public Library for hosting! https://t.co/jMkLjvLt0O Glad to join more than 1000 neighbors out this morning at the Walk to #EndAlz with Alzheimer's Association in Libertyville. I’ll continue to support federal research funding toward a cure. @alzassociation https://t.co/HWq1M4KJ4T RT @mklavers81: More than 100 Democratic House members have asked @SecPompeo to reverse the new U.S. policy that requires partners of forei… Manufacturing is a foundation for our economy, &amp; we need to ensure it continues to grow in the 21st Century. I'm working to close the skills gap and encourage the next generation to consider pursuing rewarding career opportunities in modern manufacturing. #MFGDay18 https://t.co/TbzuPgoEca RT @EqualityILL: Thank you @RepSchneider, @RepRobinKelly, @RepSchakowsky, @RepCheri, @RepMikeQuigley, @RepBillFoster, 100+ Democratic U.S.…
