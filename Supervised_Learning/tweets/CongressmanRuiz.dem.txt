Deeply saddened by the passing of the Dean of the House, Congressman John Dingell. Congressman Dingell was a driving force behind the Civil Rights Act, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act. I feel blessed to have known him: he was a leader and a patriot and will be missed. https://t.co/XdW4vPAZIA I’m proud to cosponsor the Equality Act, comprehensive legislation to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in areas including credit, housing, and employment. We must protect the civil rights of all members of the LGBTQ+ community. It’s time to act! Tomorrow, I’ll be voting for the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act – a bill to provide free, reliable childcare to veterans visiting VA health care facilities. I plan on fighting for this important bill to become law as soon as possible.
https://t.co/YmNDJP6Y5j The Administration’s #FamilySeparation policy is a stain on our nation’s conscience. Every mother and every father who loves their children should feel the pain that these children and their parents are experiencing. https://t.co/jcxYmWZAUs @ddiamond As a physician and a father, I am disgusted that HHS failed to heed the warnings of their own experts to stop the zero-humanity #FamilySeparation policy.

https://t.co/nnHs2Dw9It I was proud to join fellow members of Congress in sending a letter to the Administration strongly opposing a new ban on transgender individuals from serving in our military. I am outraged by this blatant attack on the civil rights of Americans and the security of our nation. Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are developing rare and deadly diseases from their exposure to toxic burn pits. Proud to cosponsor the Burn Pit Veterans Revision Act to ensure veterans with constrictive bronchiolitis get the benefits they have earned and deserve. February is #AfricanAmericanHistoryMonth: a time to celebrate the countless – and too often ignored – men and woman who have made our country great. Proud to represent so many individuals who have overcome prejudice and inequality to break down the barriers that divide us. During the government shutdown, the U.S. Forest Service delayed necessary prescribed burns and trainings for firefighters. Proud to have brought together California Members of Congress to urge the Administration to get us back on track.

https://t.co/qffhxS03Rh I have cosponsored H.R. 674, the Gun Violence Prevention Research Act, which will start to address this by authorizing $50 million for the CDC to research gun violence prevention. #NeverAgain Gun violence claimed more than 13,000 lives in 2018, but our nation has failed to support adequate public health research that could identify the causes and characteristics of gun violence so we can enact policies that save lives – all because of politics and campaign promises. On Friday, I joined FIND Food Bank to hear from federal employees who weren’t paid during the government shutdown and provide them with free meals. Many of these families will continue to feel the shutdown's effects in the weeks ahead.
https://t.co/sq1d1Dzo3W Bottom line, this shutdown should never have happened, and politicians should never intentionally harm the American people with a shutdown as leverage for political gain. The shutdown will soon be over but the damage from this reckless shutdown will be felt for months and years to come. Families have lost thousands from their retirement, incurred late payment fees, face higher interest rate penalties, and small businesses may never fully recover. Excited to see some familiar faces tomorrow at the Pass Area Veterans Expo! This is a great chance for veterans to learn about the services and benefits available to them. The event will be from 10 am to 1 pm at the Beaumont Civic Center, 550 E. Sixth St. https://t.co/5FxxCMXQV1 The uninsured rate reached a four-year high due to President Trump's sabotage of the ACA.

Scientists, astronauts, government leaders, and the American people worked together – believed in one another – to succeed. #Apollo11 Today I met with the VA to ensure they understand that we must get our burn pits exposed vets the treatment and benefits they have earned immediately. I wasn’t satisfied with their response so I will be submitting an official inquiry to get them to do their jobs. We cannot wait! Congratulations to JJ, a local resident and Leukemia survivor, who just found out last night that his dream of swimming with dolphins will be coming true thanks to the @MakeAWish Foundation! I hope you have a wonderful time JJ and I can’t wait to hear about this when you return! https://t.co/AQaDjZapHG With wildfire season intensifying, @SanBernardinoNF has announced increased fire restrictions for visitors that go into effect today.

He above and beyond today by bringing locally-made ice cream from his district in Cincinatti, Ohio! Thanks @RepWenstrup! https://t.co/8llO11DnsI Today Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee tried to say they are already doing enough oversight of the Administration’s handling of children forcibly separated from their parents. @RepJoeKennedy , @RepCardenas, and I disagree. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/4L4zwlFZlb RT @CALFIRERRU: Thunderstorms are expected in the afternoons this week in the mountains &amp; deserts.

That is why last week, I introduced the People’s Right to Petition Congress Act, a bill that will allow the American people to force Congress to vote on issues important to them. https://t.co/FPar8YkyYP Thank you to the @WashTimes for highlighting my bill to strengthen Medicare and ensure seniors have access to the gold standard of care for opioid addiction.

https://t.co/YM8SwOkBw8 Today I proudly supported our troops by voting to give them a 2.6% pay raise and ensure that spouses and children of fallen heroes get their benefits even in the event of a government shutdown. I will always fight to support our troops and their families. It’s the least we can do RT @WashTimes: "It is critical that all Americans — regardless of their age or how much money they make — have access to high-quality, comp… With the slower summer season comes road and lane closures that can affect your morning or evening commute.

https://t.co/rFWva1uTjb It was a pleasure to meet with constituents from the Alzheimer’s Association who came to my office to express their support for H.R. 1676. I am proud to have answered their call by cosponsoring this important bill so we can ensure universal access to quality palliative care. https://t.co/n2xR6BIa7A RT @RepLouCorrea: I am leading 122 #Democrats in demanding answers from @DHSgov &amp; @HHSgov.

Now it, along with my bill to strengthen Medicare and help ensure our seniors have access to the gold standard of care for opioid misuse disorder, head to the Senate! Young children forcibly separated from their mother’s arms suffer from toxic stress and irreversible psychological trauma. That’s why I’m demanding an immediate hearing to investigate whether HHS is providing adequate care for these young children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/0K4ris9Xgs Right now, veterans are developing rare, debilitating, and fatal illnesses that most probably are linked to their exposure to #BurnPits. The VA and DOD must stop the excuses and start giving our veterans the care they need. @BurnPit360 @IAVA https://t.co/9cZSCCwJYu Before votes in the Capitol earlier this week, I met with 7th and 8th graders from Palm Desert Charter Middle School and they had some great questions. I’m not sure the students got the answer they were expecting for the last one! https://t.co/zd3wgGmOZ2 RT @JeffPohjola: First pitch a grounder to Rep. @SteveScalise at second, who turns a quick throw to first to get @CongressmanRuiz for the f… We have a responsibility to treat all children with respect, dignity, and humanity. (4/4) This trauma will have severe long-term health consequences and puts many of   these children at great risk of human trafficking. I am appalled by the Administration’s policies and they must end. (3/4) Many of these children are seeking asylum from unspeakable violence and this administration is adding to their suffering by imposing the extreme psychological trauma of being separated from their parents. (2/4) Separating young children from their parents is horrifying and inhumane, and goes against the very core of our values as Americans. (1/4) Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a little-known liver disease that affects an estimated 30 million adults in America. Today is #NashDay to increase awareness about this disease.

https://t.co/39B2TQLFwo Join me today in remembering the 49 beautiful lives that were tragically lost two years ago at the #Pulse nightclub shooting. Together we can heal, lift each other up, and foster acceptance and love. https://t.co/SbDe9QCo1F I am disappointed that once again Republican leadership has blocked a vote on my bipartisan legislation to ban members of Congress from flying first class on the taxpayer’s dime. I won’t give up until my common sense COACH Act is made law. https://t.co/pMoBhM30Tz 130 MILLION Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the ACA.

More work ahead and I will keep fighting using our all-hands-on-deck approach! https://t.co/4QeRPsE6kT When a person walks into a store, they shouldn’t have to wonder whether they’ll be denied service because of who they are or who they love. Today’s SCOTUS decision is disappointing and exactly why Congress needs to pass the #equalityact. #OpenToAll https://t.co/VPyarG4r22 Today is #NationalTrailsDay, where thousands of people from the across the country are working together to clean up and improve local parks and trails. If you’re participating, I want to hear about the wonderful work you are doing! This breaks my heart and should be a wake-up call for our nation. Whether it’s an earthquake in California or a hurricane in Puerto Rico, we can and must do better.

Looking forward to this, and to meeting the two foster youth who will shadow me for the day! #FosterYouthVoices. https://t.co/pMdYDxPwnG EVERYONE – regardless of where they live or how much money they make – has the right to healthcare, including information about safe, legal abortion https://t.co/TN9nZ3NkV4 #ProtectTitleX How many more school shootings will we have before Speaker Ryan allows a vote on common sense gun violence prevention legislation. #fedup This week I testified before the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee about the dangers of exposure to burn pits. It's time to put our veterans above bureaucracy &amp; get them the care they need and deserve. @iava @Burnpit360 #BurnPit https://t.co/DaqCZ5pSnq Be kind to others and treat them as you would want to be treated.
