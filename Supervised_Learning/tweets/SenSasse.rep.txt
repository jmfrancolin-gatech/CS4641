One foot in front of another – this kid’s got grit and heart. Noah is an inspiring athlete and a great Nebraskan. I’m honored he’s my guest at tonight’s #SOTU. Full video here: https://t.co/wUQcCt0fZQ https://t.co/y6DejV6Z77 In this country, all of us are created equal. If that equality means anything, surely it means that infanticide is wrong. Frankly, this shouldn’t be hard. https://t.co/9MyPVGpw7p Thousands of Americans come to DC for the #MarchForLife. This should fill us with hope. Our cause is pro-woman, pro-baby, pro-science, and pro-human dignity. We’re pro-truth, and truth is winning. https://t.co/kl4EnFNf4m Statement on reports about withdrawal from Syria: https://t.co/F1Ebt9vFJm President George H.W. Bush served the American people with honor, diligence, and integrity — from his Naval service to the Oval Office. His family knows well the sacrifices required of public service and they have the gratitude of our entire country.

https://t.co/yQx91EfuWy https://t.co/nZaLbXEPoB Like always, Nebraska answered the call. This time it was to ensure that a Vietnam Vet wasn’t buried alone. Hundreds joined together to remember &amp; celebrate Stanley C. Stoltz, who along with thousands of Nebraskans, answered our country’s call to service. We are forever grateful. https://t.co/6iSODCdkbi The greatest things in life are not on the battlefield, but the battlefield makes it possible for the greatest things in life to exist. The framework for ordered liberty happens because people like this and people like you all are willing to sacrifice.

Thanks for serving, 394th. https://t.co/t7YpTBoQVr Senator Sasse and Brett Kavanaugh: The Constitution Tilts Toward Liberty https://t.co/TU0iKfisLJ We can and we should do better than this. It's predictable now that every confirmation hearing is going to be an overblown, politicized circus. And it's because we've accepted a bad new theory about how our three branches of government should work.

Today, we honor the 160,000 troops who fought their way onto the beaches and we tell the story of one Nebraskan whose work made it possible. #DDay https://t.co/izniPgV3ak About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada &amp; Mexico aren't China. You don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. "Make America Great Again" shouldn’t mean "Make America 1929 Again." Today, we remember the story of a special Nebraskan monument to our fallen heroes. May this Sea of Red be a tribute to your courage &amp; service forever. Happy #MemorialDay, and Go Big Red. #gbr https://t.co/kUS4jI1DgT Kim Jong Un is a murderous despot and habitual liar. The President made the right call to cancel this summit.

Today we honor Norman Borlaug, the ag pioneer who was born #OnThisDay in 1914. https://t.co/Ak098MErhg Lots of folks in politics &amp; the media are misconstruing trade.

Someone needs to answer for this. 

https://t.co/Rz3vsJF9Qa Here's how steel tariffs will actually kill steel jobs. https://t.co/NzKSGpc2Ek Op-ed with @NEFarmBureau: We need to drop the talk of unnecessary and painful trade wars and work to protect NAFTA. Nebraskans have won with NAFTA and scrapping the agreement would be a disastrously bad idea.​  https://t.co/dIdBlOTkjC We’ve tried tariffs like these a bunch of times over the last two centuries. Every time, American families have suffered. This trade policy will be disastrous. https://t.co/x1KeV9d2y9 Trade is great for America. It's great for American families. Trade creates jobs &amp; lowers prices for American families. 

Trade wars do the opposite. No trade war has ever worked. We don't want to make America 1930 again. https://t.co/fK7oy7GcVz #OnThisDay 151 years ago, Nebraska officially became a state. Today we celebrate the pioneers, caretakers of the land, statesmen, and volunteers who have made our state so great. https://t.co/LsjdesXjRa #OnThisDay in 1980, we beat the USSR in a hockey match that is still one of sports history’s greatest upsets: the Miracle on Ice. https://t.co/ULRH4S5DtV Sports don’t just build character; they reveal it.

Thanks for making Nebraska proud! @SONebraska #SOHillDay https://t.co/cyVdmnRyp2 Today we remember the "Buffalo Soldiers" who served at Nebraska’s Ft Robinson nearly 100 years before the Civil Rights Act. These volunteers suffered indignities from their colleagues, commanding officers, and even from the very citizens they worked to protect. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/bS3s76rUw6 Honored to have @NEStatePatrol’s John Lewis as my #SOTU guest tonight.

Check out the 2018 dates and learn more about this 75-year-old tradition here: https://t.co/iZi9NNF1Uy https://t.co/2phIRUD12w #OnThisDay in 1888, a blizzard tore through the Great Plains, killing about 300 people, many of them children. But the real story wasn’t the great power of the storm, it was the great stories of resilience and heroism - especially of the schoolteachers. https://t.co/4UXYjy2VQO This is national security 101: Washington should be hunting down terrorists who fund global violence with domestic drug money. https://t.co/XGUMbrWGIK It’s not helpful to call the press the enemy of the American people.

But the story is bigger than the sport - it's about inventor James Naismith &amp; his heart for service. What he teaches us: https://t.co/axOqfvJ6if #OnThisDay in 1777, Washington led his army into a winter encampment at Valley Forge. Why we should remember their bleak Christmas today: https://t.co/VdCRiaFgU4 CONFIRMED.

Watch the incredible story: https://t.co/a1kwLVKeE6 Today we give thanks that our country was based on the premise of religious liberty. Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/x3aEaFDWvR #OnThisDay in 1863, President Lincoln spoke timeless truths on a Civil War battlefield to unite a tired &amp; divided nation around our founding beliefs.

Thank you for your service. https://t.co/Yx7dGfWLED The ABA purports to be a neutral arbiter, but is frankly twisting its ratings process to drive a political agenda. Here's how: https://t.co/kyQgSNHOOT #OnThisDay 53 years ago, Reagan gave his famous “A Time for Choosing” speech.
