Early on the White House refused to say whether and when they had given ethics waivers to various lobbyists to go to work in the Trump administration, and my Bill, the White House Ethics Transparency Act in #HR1 will prevent this from happening in the future. #ForThePeople https://t.co/WmDLWahxvH HR1 includes my Bill, the White House Ethics Transparency Act, to maximize transparency and accountability by requiring the Trump and future Administrations to promptly disclose waivers of executive branch ethics rules to the Office of Government Ethics. #ForThePeople #HR1 https://t.co/MbNxJ0GdP7 The Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing this morning on H.R.1, the #ForThePeople Act, to restore the promise of American democracy by making it easier to vote, ending the dominance of big money in politics and fighting to end corruption in our government. #HR1 (2/2) Regardless of the circumstance you could count on getting a fair shake with Gary LaPierre.
