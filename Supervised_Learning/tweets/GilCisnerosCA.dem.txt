Ready to not only begin my service as your Representative, but also embark on all the good work we will do for our district &amp; Nation. https://t.co/i1AFPHlj9V I want to wish you all a #HappyNewYear from my family to yours. May your year bring you joy and fulfillment. I have been very lucky to meet so many activists and members of our community this past year during my campaign &amp; look forward to #2019 &amp; my new form of service. The Trump admin is once again demonstrating that it has no respect for our civil servants and the services they provide. This new Congress must and will stand up to POTUS. 
https://t.co/2DRsAkimhI 2018 saw some of the most drastic cuts in US Refugee admissions. These are people fleeing violence &amp; persecution. In the new year we need to come together for immigration reform that has our nation's principles at heart. 
https://t.co/rxphBqokCo Investigating the conditions at our border should be a top priority for the new Congress. And the President's insistence on a senseless border wall has put much needed funding for medical resources, personnel, and smart, safe border technology on hold. https://t.co/DVzgQdqEFG From our family to yours, wishing you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays filled with hope, happiness, and good cheer. This holiday season let us not only spend time with our loved ones, but give back to our communities and those less fortunate. 

-the Cisneros family https://t.co/8qWCiwHmLx The #TrumpShutdown is affecting hundreds of government employees and services as we approach this holiday season.   

https://t.co/W05VIfAudI Our veterans deserve to be taken care of after protecting our nation. I am encouraged to hear that the VA will now make sure that caregivers aren’t being dropped. Our veterans should not be left vulnerable &amp; without support.
https://t.co/BviCIB6Cb2 A shutdown has real consequences. The President shouldn't be playing games with our government over funding for a senseless border wall that does nothing to improve border security or address immigration reform. While I'm encouraged that the admin has moved to ban bump stocks, its safety report caters to the NRA. It recommends that we arm our teachers, which is not what police officers, parents, &amp; teachers want. We need common sense reform. 
https://t.co/B3MZ55Sl6T I look forward to working alongside my colleagues to hold this administration accountable. The government should work for the people, not special interests. https://t.co/OeVfKyagWf Instead of focusing on building a senseless wall, the Trump admin should be promoting immigration reform &amp; protecting those with pre-existing conditions. This admin continues to be out of touch with what Americans want. https://t.co/SWpe6armcw Honored to be one of the 43 Latinx serving the 116th Congress. I'm confident that we can work together to achieve comprehensive reform &amp; create a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers. 

https://t.co/mMpg1kcnp7 The Texas district court ruling has endangered millions of Americans. The Trump admin continues to lie about protecting those with pre-existing conditions. We must fight back to save our country's healthcare system. Today we remember the 26 young &amp; incident lives that were taken in the #SandyHook tragedy. In 2018 we saw the largest increase in gun related deaths. We need to do something, and in the 116th Congress, I will fight to ensure we bring common-sense gun reform to the floor. Encouraged to hear there’s bipartisan support for comprehensive sexual harassment reform in Congress. Survivors deserve justice &amp; politicians shouldn’t hide behind taxpayer dollars.
https://t.co/junko9qqBk Vietnamese Americans are an important part of our #CA39 community. This admin's decision to target them for deportation is unacceptable &amp; contrary to our values. I was proud to stand alongside the Vietnamese community during my campaign &amp; I will continue to do so in Congress. The agreement reached between Leader Pelosi and my colleagues to adopt term limits for leadership positions will push our Party to lift up new and diverse voices. With this commitment, I will support and vote for Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker of the House. https://t.co/h3DP1GTzCc “Although we faced millions in outside spending, our victory brought down the Orange Curtain.

People's lives are at stake. https://t.co/z496qeN43W These are families fleeing persecution &amp; violence &amp; they should be allowed to seek asylum. This is also why we need humane, comprehensive immigration reform as soon as this new Congress is sworn in.

My thoughts are also with those families who were recently affected by the wildfires, and I hope they're able to weather any further damages. I’m proud to stand w/ the House Democrats to work to remove obstacles to voting, close loopholes in government ethics &amp; work to get dark money out of politics. Our government should work for the people, not special interests. #CA39 

https://t.co/jj9Qkbe7dD It's important for an elected official to respond to feedback, even if it's in disagreement. I have been open and honest about my call for new leadership &amp; finding ways to further encourage, develop &amp; cultivate the next great diverse leaders of our Party.

Take a listen to how the Freshman class got their office selection.

https://t.co/aR7gLA7AzS Instead of addressing climate change, the Trump Admin is putting Big Oil &amp; corporations ahead of protecting our sacred land &amp; wildlife. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. #CA39 
https://t.co/itgz8TyMY6 One of my priorities in Congress will be to advocate for more infrastructure investment. I’m confident that both parties can work together to improve &amp; modernize our nation’s roads, ports &amp; schools. #CA39 
https://t.co/bKWUW6PGHZ I want to wish a #HappyHanukkah to all those who will be celebrating. May this holiday season bring you love and joy. The start of the new Congress is around the corner, and I'm ready to protect our healthcare system from this administration. If you're a CA resident -- open enrollment ends Jan. 15. Sign up today!

https://t.co/3bEskDmlnS The President has once again picked special interests over the American people. We should be protecting our oceans &amp; environment, not endangering our coastlines &amp; wildlife.

https://t.co/1NrkpTNmQR I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to fight for California even before being sworn in. 

Federal funding is critical to address the devastation from wildfires &amp; we must work in a bipartisan manner to bring relief to our communities. #CA39 https://t.co/bTdfQTVdIB President George H.W. Bush's life and career exemplified service and character. He was dedicated not only to his country, but to his family. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family at this time.

https://t.co/tNfi37KLvb The LGBTQ community deserves equal rights &amp; our respect, including those that choose to put their lives on the line and defend our country. Everyone should be allowed to serve our nation, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. #CA39 https://t.co/CuznIXG9kM Firing tear gas at women and children seeking asylum is not the solution.

https://t.co/zEo0bcSWz1 If the deadly wildfires weren't enough evidence, the new federal climate report makes it clear - climate change will only worsen if we don't act now.

And our firefighters and brave first responders combating the wildfires. Thank you to all of them. And I wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving!

I apreciate everyone’s support during this process, &amp; we’ll continue to watch vigilantly until the race is officially called. Our campaign has been optimistic since election night, &amp; we’ve fought to ensure that every person’s vote is counted. The Registrars have confirmed that this continues to be a fair &amp; open process, &amp; any allegations of fraud are unequivocally false and without merit. The people of this district know that climate change is real, that people with pre-existing conditions should be able to afford health insurance, &amp; that our President should be offering assistance to California’s fire victims. We left nothing on the table during this election. We fought as hard as we could, &amp; I am so proud of my team &amp; thankful to all of our volunteers.

The Cisneros team is very proud of the democratic momentum that everyone helped build in the 39th, &amp; we’ll continue to work to ensure every ballot is counted &amp; every voice is heard. If you’re contacted by the voter registrars of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, or Orange County, you will need to sign a simple form to validate your vote before the deadline on Wed. The form can be emailed to you, or someone from our team can bring the form to help you fill it out. There are approximately 70,000 ballots still left to count. To make sure that your ballot counts, the campaign is chasing vote by mail ballots that were not signed by voters. Today on #VeteransDay we honor the servicemen and women who have defended our country and our values.

Beyond our respect, they deserve our support. We need to serve those who have served us. The most important thing right now is to give the Registrars every opportunity to count ballots. We're confident that this process will play out in our favor, and thank you for the continued support. #CA39 We now only trail by 1.6% and the wind is at our backs.

I find that Gil will not only be a voice for the Latinx community, but for everyone.” #GilOnTheHill https://t.co/b2KvvjXdDL Recent polling shows that we are up by 1 point, which means it all comes down to turn out. We need everyone who cares about democracy to come out &amp; canvass!  Sign up &amp; join us this weekend! #CA39 https://t.co/saNSX0FtRs When people ask me what my favorite aspect about the campaign trail is, I always tell them that speaking with &amp; listening to #CA39 residents is what I enjoy most. I'm looking forward to giving the #CA39 communities the representation they deserve. #GilOnTheHill https://t.co/r4sh4Jyr7M Had a great time phone &amp; text banking yesterday! With only 5 days left, I'm very grateful for everyone who is stoping by our field office to help us out. Together we can do this! #CA39 #GilOnTheHill #TakeItBack https://t.co/OgBNnmCJj0 Just because I'm Latino &amp; my opponent is Asian, I'm not going to cede certain demographics. #CA39 wants the same thing everybody else does: healthcare, immigration reform, &amp; to make sure their kids are safe in school.  #CA39 #AAPI @latimes @cmaiduc

We are continuously working to ensure that young children get the support and encouragement they need to succeed. #CA39 https://t.co/iGUza8Keoe President of the Tri County Democrats Peggye Jackson knows she can trust me to be a fair representative for everyone in #CA39. We need fewer partisan leaders, and more who will put country over party. #GilontheHill https://t.co/WSiOdyboz1 .@realDonaldTrump -- Immigrants work hard, contribute to our country, &amp; I'm proud to count them as my friends, neighbors, and fellow veterans. I am proud to live in a community of immigrants, and #CA39 is better off because of its diversity. https://t.co/zPySmuBUHr RT @FemMajority: .@GilCisnerosCA is an education advocate who has made it his mission to strengthen public schools &amp; pave college opportuni… Attacks on DREAMers.

Director of Ground Game (DOGG) Charlie runs a tight ship. #CA39 #PupsforGil https://t.co/tVmUirUIih https://t.co/ZFNh2cJth3 .@YoungKimCD39 is taking thousands of dollars from the NRA &amp; @GunOwners Victory Fund. She's made it clear that she stands w/ the gun lobby over protecting #CA39 residents. We need common sense gun legislation to keep weapons out of dangerous people's hands. #LatinaEqualPayDay is a reminder of the injustices towards our country's Latinas. It has been over 50 years since the Equal Pay Act &amp; Latinas make 53 cents less then men per dollar. All women deserve equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/NjIqxW2TQD This is the LAST weekend before the election!  Bring your friends &amp; family!  We will provide the donuts, coffee, entertainment &amp; training.  This election will decide the future of our country, I hope you take this opportunity to make your voice heard. #CA39 #GilontheHill https://t.co/g2nlkTwfoV RT @future_majority: Ask yourself: "What does America need right now? Absolute power or a balance of power?" Think about it.

We hope everyone has a safe &amp; fun Halloween with their families! https://t.co/A5RWrsNH01 Honored to have @JoeBiden's endorsement. I've served my country in the Navy, I serve it now by investing in students from underserved communities, and I want to serve my community in Congress. #CA39 #GilontheHill https://t.co/XKJMgU3ItC I'm proud of the work my campaign has done to engage Latinx voters. #CA39 saw a 245% upsurge in the 2018 primary when compared to 2014. I hope to represent the Latinx community in Congress &amp; fight for the issues most pressing to our community. https://t.co/n7fI3B4js8 TY to @KBSAmericaInc &amp; Steve Kang for giving me the opportunity to talk about issues that matter to #CA39 including education, healthcare &amp; immigration reform. https://t.co/B181eC3Cis The President has refused to defend the #ACA in courts, &amp; celebrated at the White House when Republicans passed a bill stripping those protections. https://t.co/9HAW7crQly Shame on the #GOP for supporting Trump's reckless immigration policy. We must hold DC Republicans accountable by heading to the polls on November 6. #CA39 #TakeItBack 
https://t.co/IozgjdjiWJ The @latimes reports that "Anti-Semitic incidents are surging across the U.S." We should not stand for this as a nation &amp; need to call out dangerous &amp; discriminatory rhetoric that leads to shootings, like the one at Tree of Life Synagogue.

I encourage those who served to apply for this prestigious award. #CA39
https://t.co/mxyAAUA6rY Families are still feeling the effects of the President's heartless "zero-tolerance" policy. I spoke out against this cruel policy. I visited the border in Tornillo, TX &amp; I'll continue to be a voice for these children.
https://t.co/ga8nzNVZIx The @DCCC understands the importance of engaging directly with our diverse communities. In #CA39 we're reaching out to people who haven’t been talked to before or who have been ignored. I want to make it clear that I'll listen &amp; be their voice in Congress. https://t.co/3gFFB0jXds Corporations are wreaking massive profits &amp; ripping us off. President Trump is letting BigOil tear up our public lands, and risk the habitats of threatened species. We must hold his administration accountable.
https://t.co/UDaCUkuSN9 My life has been about service &amp; I want to continue that service by representing #CA39 in Congress. I will fight for investments in education, access to affordable healthcare, &amp; for our vets. https://t.co/4Jlc4EBzxG The President wants to end citizenship for children born in this country. This is unconstitutional &amp; a blatant attack on our immigrant community. Our district needs a leader that will stand up for our immigrant families.

TY to everyone who came out &amp; volunteered over the weekend.  With early voting underway, it's crucial that you discuss plans for voting w/ your family &amp; friends. You can't count on polls or Twitter to win this for us. #CA39 #GilontheHill https://t.co/MmqXkchePX This admin has refused to defend the ACA in federal court &amp; its #GOPTaxScam further undermined affordable healthcare.

They are lying through their teeth. People's life-saving care is at risk. We need to all vote on November 6th. #CountryOverParty
https://t.co/ujyvI6xpqg I'm proud to have served alongside my shipmate Leon, and I'm humbled by his words and support. We can do this. #CA39 #GilontheHill https://t.co/zuKxBHBUAu Words matter. Leadership matters. The President's rhetoric has impact and instead of calling for unity, he chooses to vilify the media. Our country stands for something better.
https://t.co/xfZz2JzUrg TY to everyone who came to today's canvass! I had a great time knocking on doors around Rowland Heights! I really enjoy speaking to constituents in the district and I truly believe the conversations I have at the doors -- and through car windows! -- matter. #CA39 https://t.co/F7SJbNeiY2
