Here in #NY25 and across New York State, we know how important it is to #RaiseTheWage and create an economy that puts workers first. And we will not stop fighting until every worker in America is finally paid a living wage. https://t.co/ePjnY70Blh We face a clear threat to our national safety. We need improved leadership within the ATF, a stronger commitment to gun shop safety, and decisive action to prevent violators from retaining their federal licenses to sell dangerous weapons. #GunLawsSaveLives #EndGunViolence These dangerous weapons enter the black market and underground weapons pipelines where they are sold on the order of thousands of dollars. The local shops are rarely held accountable for failing to secure their firearms and the situation never abated. Here in Monroe County, one gun shop has been burglarized seven times since 2007. Nationwide, more than 575 gun shops were burglarized in 2017, releasing thousands of guns into the streets and into the hands of criminals. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/HlZKZ7ORic Our nation is facing a devastating gun violence epidemic that is exacerbated by growing instances of gun shop burglaries. Today I called on Acting AG Whitaker to take immediate action to address this crisis that is threatening the safety of our community.

This is the least we could do for these hardworking federal workers. Federal workers were innocent bystanders when the #TrumpShutdown began and should not bear the burden of its effects. These workers simply want to be able to pay their bills and provide for their families Our ninth attempt at opening the govt would fund all 7 remaining appropriations bills through Feb. 28. The President and Senate Republicans have an obligation to do what is best for Americans and join us in bipartisan solutions that restore stability and certainty to our nation. We are 27 days into the #TrumpShutdown and that‚Äôs 27 days too long. My colleagues and I in the House are yet again offering the President a clear pathway to end this shutdown that is hurting millions of American families and severely damaging our economy. https://t.co/jGvd33qXC4 I was honored to stand with the friends and family of Col.

Included in the bill is a measure to end the shutdown and re-open the federal gov't through Feb. 8, ensuring services are available for disaster victims. We urge the Senate and President to finally take up our bipartisan measures to fund the gov't and support working families. It‚Äòs crucial we help ensure our neighbors have the recourses to get their lives back after a disaster.

I look forward to working with Chairman @BobbyScott and our colleagues to strengthen working families. https://t.co/CEukuviCOt You can tune into the House Rules Committee now where my colleagues and I will be discussing over $15b in emergency spending for infrastructure, veterans, farmers and mental health among other issues. @RulesDemocrats https://t.co/LBAQxugJsa My thoughts go out to you, @RepHastingsFL. You and your family are in my prayers as you prepare for this fight ahead. https://t.co/oHmgzW9jUv Instead of a #borderwall, $5B could pay for 1.4 million people to have Medicaid coverage and we could be a step closer to ensuring every American has the access to the healthcare they deserve. #EndtheShutdownNow https://t.co/sCsVmOyF5S If the President truly wants to secure our nation‚Äôs future, then maybe he should start by investing in our greatest resource - our children. Instead of squandering $5B on a needless #borderwall we could use these funds to increases education funding by 30%! #NoBorderWall https://t.co/qOEPP1YDk8 Rather than fund the President‚Äôs wasteful #borderwall we could take steps to address the very real threat that #climatechange poses to our safety and security by DOUBLING the amount of federal funding for renewable energy programs #ClimateChangeisReal #EndtheShutdownNow https://t.co/amjezrY9tR Yet further evidence demonstrating the need to take immediate action to address #climatechange. The health and safety of both this and future generations is at risk and we need to take action now. #ClimateChangeisReal https://t.co/kPTX8SSHXO @linny822 Thank you for this, Linda! We will pass this issue on to see if it can be resolved! I strongly urge the President and my colleagues in the Senate to join the House in supporting measures to immediately reopen our government and provide some peace of mind to the hundreds of thousands of public servants who are relying on them. #EndTheShutdownNow The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of American families are at stake. That's why today the House passed measures to ensure federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay receive compensation at the earliest date possible after the shutdown comes to an end. This President has threatened, without any reservation or consideration for the millions of Americans being impacted, that he is willing to keep the government shut down for ‚Äòyears' - jeopardizing the financial security of over 14,000 New Yorkers who are going without paychecks. https://t.co/wo3SvCpMSh My colleagues and I are committed to honoring our pledge to put your needs first. We will continue to support and pass bipartisan measures that fund the government and ensure Americans are protected. #EndTheShutdownNow That is why I voted to provide $222 million to the Environmental Protection Agency as well as fully fund other critical agencies that protect the health and safety of everyday Americans. Our nation is at a crisis point. Every American‚Äôs right to clean air, clean water, and access to safe and sanitary parks has been jeopardized by this President‚Äôs defiant refusal to return sanity to our nation and reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown Hate and intolerance have no place in our society, and together we will continue the fight to ensure #equality for every person. I am proud to co-sponsor and vote for legislation that will combat #antisemitism. This bill will play a critical role toward ensuring the guaranteed #civilrights and #humanrights of the Jewish community not only in America but across the globe. https://t.co/W1LOuJlmpl Congratulations to @rocRMSC on the completion of the newly-renovated Planetarium! Can‚Äôt wait to visit! https://t.co/lezQuUpxTN That is why the House has passed legislation to immediately fund these vital services and programs. It is time to restore order to our government. Our families deserve better. Furthermore, this #TrumpShutdown has imperiled the safety of our  transportation system with thousands of air traffic controllers and highway workers furloughed or working without pay. With each passing day of the #TrumpShutdown, more and more Americans are being endangered ‚Äì including roughly 2.2 million low-income families and individuals who are facing eviction because they can no longer access critical rental assistance programs. This is another demonstration that the House majority is committed to governing responsibly and working #ForThePeople. We will continue to offer the president every opportunity to re-open the government so we can address the matters pressing our nation. #EndTheShutdown This legislation accomplishes the following: 
‚úÖGuarantees families will still receive essential SNAP benefits.
‚úÖEnsures FDA and USDA can continue preventing public health epidemics.
‚úÖProvides assistance to farmers.
‚úÖSupports rural infrastructure development projects. That is why I joined @HouseDemocrats in passing the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2019 Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA and Related Agencies appropriations bill to re-open the Department of Agriculture. It is nearly identical to the version that passed the Senate. #EndTheShutdown The President‚Äôs refusal to reopen the government has put millions at risk, including families and individuals who rely on the critical support SNAP benefits provide and our nation‚Äôs hardworking farmers whose livelihoods depend on essential government services. #EndTheShutdown It is inexcusable that the President has allowed this shutdown to reach this point. The House has passed and continues to pass measures that will fund the government so legislators can get to work #ForThePeople. Tomorrow morning federal employees will wake up and see they don't have the paycheck they rely on to pay their bills, buy their groceries, and support their families. https://t.co/yz9TKqq0o7 Instead of a wasteful wall, $5 billion would double funding for mental health and substance programs that support some of the most vulnerable members of our society. #NoWall #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Stzj9V5Y95 I will continue to work tirelessly to safeguard access to affordable care, lower health costs and the price of prescription drugs, protect people with preexisting conditions and strengthen access to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. #ProtectOurCare That is why I joined the @HouseDemocrats in taking action to protect NYer's access to healthcare by passing a resolution that strengthens Congress's hand to intervene in this lawsuit, which would strike down the #ACA including its key provisions and protections. Bottom line: we should be making it easier, not harder for everyday Americans to obtain health coverage they need and deserve. #ProtectOurCare The Texas v. US lawsuit would wreak havoc by eliminating: 
‚úñÔ∏èProtections for 130m people w preexisting conditions
‚úñÔ∏èMedicaid expansion that covers 15m people
‚úñÔ∏èInsurance tax credits used by 9m Americans
‚úñÔ∏èBans on discriminating against women
#ProtectOurCare Now more than ever the American people are counting on Congress to stand up and fight back against those who seek to dismantle our health care system and the fundamental protections that it guarantees. #ProtectOurCare .@WillowCenterROC, in my district, is operating with no assurance it will be able to continue offering critical services after January 18. We must end this harmful shutdown, reopen the government and get to work. American lives depends on it. Because of the #TrumpShutdown, #VAWA has lapsed and agencies are scrambling to ensure they can help domestic violence victims. https://t.co/SyH3caFNJk Thank you @GabbyGiffords for your tireless advocacy and leadership addressing #GunReform. #HR8 has bipartisan support and will finally implement necessary background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. https://t.co/dm5ksAfRqt Rather than inciting fear and escalating the crisis, we must come together to fund the gov‚Äôt. Congress has offered Trump a clear path to reopen the gov‚Äôt and it‚Äòs his duty to join us to enact a responsible, bipartisan solution to restore certainty and stability for the Americans. The gov‚Äôt shutdown has created an economic crisis that lies squarely on the President‚Äôs shoulders. Nearly 1m federal workers and their families are w/o pay while essential services to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the American people have come screeching to a halt. Tonight the President demonstrated again that he lacks the courage to swallow his pride, stand up and lead our nation. Rather, he has chosen to continue cowering behind his own wall of misinformation and misguided priorities that harm communities and families across the nation. RT @RulesDemocrats: The American people deserve a Congress that works. That‚Äôs why our rules are already fulfilling our promise to clean up‚Ä¶ Just finished my first meeting as a member of @RulesDemocrats and took a moment to reflect on someone who made this committee so historic: my dear friend, Louise Slaughter. It is an honor to serve on the same body that she once chaired, the only woman to do so. https://t.co/C3ObaHU7jn Tune to CSPAN3 now to watch the Committee on Rules meeting where we will discuss individual appropriations bills, identical to those previously passed in the Senate, to re-open the government and get back to working #ForThePeople. @RulesDemocrats
https://t.co/QZKF5OZFlP It is humbling to be joined by @GabbyGiffords in the House as we announce this legislation. Her strength as a steward for #GunReform inspires us all to continue her fight and work tirelessly to end the epidemic of gun violence that has plagued our nation for too long. I am proud to support #HR8 and ensure universal background checks on firearm purchases becomes law. This bill is just one example of common-sense, bipartisan legislation that will protect Americans and help prevent more senseless tragedies. https://t.co/p3kkzIUKZq Instead of a wall, $5 billion could be spent in countless other meaningful ways to improve the lives of Americans - for example, we could use that funding to üö®DOUBLEüö® aid to provide heat for low income housing, helping over 12 million families in need. #NoWall #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/M27Rl7wrpN It is an incredible privilege to work alongside all 91 of these inspiring women and dedicated public servants. They are what makes this #116thCongress so historic. I look forward to our efforts ahead working #ForthePeople. https://t.co/i0ddqBhUuY Democrats are ready to show we are #ForThePeople. #HR1 would: 
‚úÖReduce voting barriers and enact automatic registration.
‚úÖRemove dark money in politics and empower small donors.
‚úÖHold legislators accountable and ensure they work for Americans. https://t.co/n9Gjyzs5z7 That‚Äôs why the House has passed a bill that is nearly identical to measures previously passed by the Senate to immediately and fully fund these essential programs‚Äîyet the President continues to prioritize a vanity wall over the basic needs of everyday Americans #TrumpShutdown As a result of President Trump‚Äôs irresponsible #TrumpShutdown, the Food and Nutrition Service has been forced to reduce benefits by 40% for nearly 40 million individuals and families in need who rely upon SNAP for food security https://t.co/6a8ezwSHBw This legislation makes important strides towards combatting the toxic influence of special interests in politics, demonstrates zero tolerance for corruption and abuse of power, and ensures the voice and vote of every person in this country is heard. Ensuring the integrity of our democracy and safeguarding the trust of the American people is one of the fundamental duties of our government. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to join my colleagues in the House in co-sponsoring #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.  https://t.co/hEdrJ7RpPt I look forward to getting to work to ensure we are advancing policies that expand access to quality, affordable healthcare, grow our economy, and support the needs of hardworking Americans everywhere. It‚Äôs an honor to serve on the Rules Committee - thank you to @SpeakerPelosi &amp; Chairman @RepMcGovern for this vote of confidence. The ability to engage on all legislation that moves through the House provides a unique opportunity to advocate for #NY25 on a wide variety of issues. https://t.co/AomhafBPKI To allow this shutdown to continue any further would be entirely irresponsible and, ultimately, a failure of the President‚Äôs leadership. We must not give up on our efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions that unite, not divide us, and address the issues that truly matter. Congress has offered @realDonaldTrump a clear path to reopening the government and it is now incumbent upon him to set aside his demands for a wasteful border wall and demonstrate that he is capable of doing what is right. Today, my colleagues and I in the House followed through on our commitment to immediately go to work #ForThePeople by passing necessary and common-sense spending measures that will restore stability to our government and certainty for millions of Americans. I am honored to be sworn-in to my first full term as a member of the House. I look forward to working with @SpeakerPelosi and my colleagues in the #116thCongress as we seek to create a more perfect union by creating opportunity for everyone who calls our great nation home. https://t.co/SBJd4uNXmQ Congratulations to @NancyPelosi, our new Speaker of the House! Looking forward to getting to work with my colleagues in the #116thCongress to advance policies #ForThePeople and build a stronger, more vibrant America.
