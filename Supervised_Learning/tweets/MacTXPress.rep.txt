"On Sat, my wife &amp; I had the opportunity to attend a memorial service of the most recent member of our military who was a casualty in the war against terrorists.  Army Ranger Sgt Cameron Meddock was killed a couple of weeks ago in Afghanistan on a very important mission." "And it is my view, as others have written, that the number one lesson of the last 18 years is that is we let up pressure they will spring back and spring back quickly." "We have certainly had terrorist attacks here and abroad, but I also think it is important that we pay tribute to our military, intelligence community, and law enforcement for the remarkable success that they have had in the years since 9/11." As one of the few members left on this committee who was here during 9/11, I never expected us to go nearly 18 years and not have a repeat or that sort of instance.

Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 801, the “Route 66 National Historic Trail Designation Act,” which designates Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. This stretch of highway has served an important role in supporting our district’s economy for many years. https://t.co/Am0s8TQcqp Today is the anniversary of D-Day.
