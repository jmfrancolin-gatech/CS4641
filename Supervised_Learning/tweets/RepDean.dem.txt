#ForThePeople https://t.co/IO6hAMtMf7 Today is the first day 11,471 Pennsylvania Federal employees, and thousands more nationwide, will go without their paychecks. Last week, my House colleagues &amp; I voted for previously passed bipartisan Senate bills to reopen the government. The President must #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/9C99D9NXdK Citizens who work hard for the common good deserve to know that they‚Äôll be paid what they‚Äôve been promised. I urge the President to sign this bill. https://t.co/rikxTDInX8 @Jennifer_Lugar Thank you, Jennifer and thank you for your work and advocacy on this issue! I was honored to speak on #HR8, the need for background checks and common sense gun laws. Courage is in the air, we must act on that courage.

#HR8 #GunControlNow #GunViolence https://t.co/IBPfbbqTSY I  am honored to stand with labor today in opposition to this #TrumpShutdown. These dedicated workers take pride and dignity in their work and deserve their paychecks. The President owes it to these hardworking people to reopen the government. https://t.co/vkajK39MMZ Today, I'm cosponsoring @RepSusanWild's bill to fund the Coast Guard during the shutdown. Democrats are working hard to re-open the government - and to ensure that those who protect us are paid what they've been promised. #HR421

https://t.co/3ILquLOMMd Proud and honored to stand with labor. https://t.co/mLxtE6sviF My staff just received a call from a federal employee whose electricity is about to be cut off. He has spoken with his utility company, but they are unwilling to extend forbearance. Without his paycheck this week, he won't have power in his home. This #TrumpShutdown must end. This week, I cosponsored legislation requiring universal background checks for gun sales. Here's why: https://t.co/K4kwuvOTls #gunsense #HR8 We will not go back to identifying female as a pre-existing condition. Because of the ACA:

‚úÖ 479,000 Pennsylvanians gained healthcare. 
‚úÖ Women are no longer charged more than men. 
‚úÖ 275,604 Pennsylvania seniors save $313 million on prescription drugs.

#ProtectOurCare https://t.co/vYf52KzUDq Yesterday, I was happy that we introduced #HR8 and took a strong stand on gun violence. Studies have shown that background checks work. This is a great first step in combating gun violence. Thank you @SJGoodman for your work on this issue.

#GunSense #GunSafetyNow https://t.co/Sy0ZdzdQ3v Friday will be the first day 11,471 Pennsylvania Federal employees will go without their paycheck. Congress has passed numerous bills to end this unnecessary shutdown. The President must do what is right -- end his shutdown and reopen the government.

#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Wov9f72rb4 Five of the President‚Äôs core claims were immediately rebutted by National News outlets, including Fox. The shutdown is his choice, and Democrats continue to pass legislation to open the government.

#TrumpShutown This is @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs shutdown.

We do have a humanitarian crisis of this President‚Äôs making.

Reopen the government and let America be America ‚Äî a hard working and welcoming place.

#TrumpsShutdown RT @ajplus: House Democrats just introduced legislation that would require background checks on all gun sales and most gun transfers. 

Jan‚Ä¶ @MindiCherry Thank you, Mindi! Together we can make a difference. Guns are deadly serious, and we should be equally serious about making sure they don't fall into the wrong hands. It's time to pass the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.

#HR8 #Gunsense #GunSafetyNow https://t.co/nYY8dncHVZ At a time when children are required to participate in active shooter training, it is time that we ask more of gun owners. Let's pass #HR8 and require background checks for all gun sales.

#Gunsense #GunSafetyNow https://t.co/lPZmxsEk2f Eight years ago, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was nearly killed in Tucson, and six others lost their lives. Since then, we‚Äôve seen many more communities torn apart by gun violence. Congress must act, starting with today's Bipartisan Background Checks Act.

#Gunsense #GunSafetyNow RT @RepThompson: The American people have been demanding action to prevent gun violence for years. Today, I will join @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @Gab‚Ä¶ This Friday will be the first-day Federal employees go without paychecks. Whether it is our National Parks Rangers or our Air Traffic Controllers, no one should have to worry about how they are going to feed their families.

https://t.co/ZS9RSHIfJL Today is Day 17 of @POTUS's government shutdown, and it's affecting Americans in many ways. If you've been hurt by the shutdown - or if you're worried about what's coming next - we want to hear from you. Please tweet @repdean or email shutdownstories2019@gmail.com RT @RepDeanPhillips: Funny what happens when @RepDean and I sit next to one another at the bi-partisan Congressional Research Service orien‚Ä¶ Thanks to CNN's @LaurenDezenski for inviting me to offer my views on the shutdown - as well as a few lighter topics. And thanks to reader Fatima Alsammak for suggesting me! https://t.co/DjlzBDYh27
