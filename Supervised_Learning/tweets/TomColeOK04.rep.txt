Their new expansion will create more jobs and help local economic development. Thanks for having me! https://t.co/WYmCduIoyM The Democrats‚Äô decision to shut down the government is shameful and unacceptable. I will be in Washington, D.C. working with my colleagues to ensure the government opens again. https://t.co/1DGDAN0KQw Anyone who voted to shut down the government voted against CHIP funding, funding our military and the best interests of the American taxpayer. This is shameful and irresponsible. #SchumerShutdown Shutting down the government is never a good idea. Today, on the House Floor, I urged Congress to vote on the continuing resolution that will keep the gov't open. It's the right thing to do b/c shutting down the gov't is costly &amp; irresponsible governing. https://t.co/9M4MkAx9MV RT @RulesReps: @TomColeOK04 is now managing the rule to provide for consideration of the Continuing Resolution. Watch the @HouseFloor live‚Ä¶ Playing politics at the risk of not funding our military and shutting down the government is both risky and reckless. The Democrats should put the safety and security of our nation first over their own political agenda. https://t.co/0obTIAbEp4 Thank you @SecretaryAcosta for hosting me and my staff today at the Department of Labor.
