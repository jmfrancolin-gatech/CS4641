No one should ever have to fear for their safety at home, at work, at school, or at their place of worship. Today's shooting at the #TreeofLifeSynagogue in #Pittsburg is tragic. We must root out hate in our society and hold accountable those who spread anti-Semitism and fear. Marking the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, remember that divisive  rhetoric turned into mass violence. It's not too late to roll back the  hate and remember we are all Americans. https://t.co/ubLhmPRHNt RT @danpfeiffer: First 19 months of the Trump Administration: 3.58 millions jobs
