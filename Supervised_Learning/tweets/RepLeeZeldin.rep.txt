I'm unapologetically anti illegal immigration &amp; pro legal immigration. It would be great if Cuomo found an ounce of integrity to admit he's pro illegal immigration rather than conflating it all &amp; simply saying he is pro-immigration, which couldn't be more deliberately misleading. There are hard working, middle income NY taxpayers who can't afford to send their child to college, bc they don't qualify for free tuition $. If you want to expand aid to more college students then expand it for students who are in our country legally, not illegally. Gov.

Today's agreement is great news for hardworking fed employees, but concerns on border security, including the need to harden our physical border, still must be met w positive action during these next 3 weeks.

This on-site shelter allows them to use the Northport benefits they have earned to get the care they need https://t.co/fYAkbbdqVR https://t.co/MoWnRPMxjF By securing our borders, we are not only trying to stop the line jumpers, but also combatting the heroin &amp; opioid abuse epidemic, drug trafficking, sex trafficking &amp; human trafficking.

PS The AIEF trip took me on my first trip to East Jerusalem &amp; Ramallah to meet w/ Prime Minister Hamdallah in addition to the rest of what was an amazing itinerary https://t.co/rbCBmaszKt All my colleagues on both sides of the aisle should cosponsor &amp; push for full funding of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund at the beginning of 2019. 9/11 first responders shouldn't have to come to DC again to beg for the benefits they have earned. Let's get this done #NeverForget https://t.co/9zld01FfDF 9/11 first responders shouldn't be forced to crawl back to DC again to plead a case as to why they're worthy of support. I spoke on the House floor today on their behalf calling for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to be fully funded at the start of 2019 https://t.co/0hQG9BURSI The @DeptVetAffairs must provide healthcare for our veterans suffering from service-connected illnesses &amp; as we learn more about how burn pits harmed our troops in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, the VA must provide care to those vets in need.

We discussed fed grant funding &amp; ways Congress can help them continue their great work w/ early childhood development &amp; education. https://t.co/KZ5eos9Jnd The Justice Center‚Äôs failures have been widely reported &amp; their arrogant attempt to deny the truth is a poignant reminder that when protecting themselves is in conflict w protecting the disabled, NYers w disabilities are the ones who will lose out &amp; be harmed &amp; abandoned. What's "shameful" is thinking a Justice Center charter is about dodging justice while the disabled are harmed w/out adequate protection or due process. The Center‚Äôs visceral reaction to accountability &amp; oversight is why a fed investigation is imperative. https://t.co/bCoGfVkN7M Rather than address the need for improvements &amp; accountability at the NY Justice Center, they publicly attacked &amp; sought to discredit the call for an investigation, despite detailed fact based reporting by @nytimes @Newsday @timesunion &amp; others. https://t.co/euAPLDIwTZ RT @RepStefanik: Sent a letter to @TheJusticeDept w/@RepLeeZeldin, @RepPeteKing, and @RepTomReed requesting an investigation into the NYS J‚Ä¶ Today, @RepPeteKing, @RepStefanik, @RepTomReed &amp; I are calling for a @TheJusticeDept investigation on behalf of individuals w/ disabilities (&amp; their loved ones) who have died or were otherwise abused in state care as a result of criminal misconduct. https://t.co/SLtQfcIvhj NY can't receive billions of fed tax dollars to care for disabled patients AND neglect to investigate suspicious deaths &amp; abuse of patients that happen in their facilities. The state of NY clearly refuses to hold itself accountable while victims suffer w/out justice. People w/disabilities deserve full &amp; equal protection under the law, but in NY physical abuse of the disabled has been ignored &amp; swept under the rug due to lack of action by the NYS Justice Center for the Protection of People w/ Special Needs.
