RT @UFWupdates: California farm workers won overtime protections in 2016, now it’s time to ensure #farmworkers all over the nation also ear… ICYMI – I wrote an op-ed this week on someone very dear to me who was like a second mother, Mrs. Shelton. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her. https://t.co/ndu4XVkTvP Yesterday Republicans advanced 44 of Trump's nominees to lifetime federal court seats - nominees who have expressed views that are contrary to many of our foundational values of justice and equality. We all need to pay attention to what this Administration is doing to our courts. https://t.co/GiMmndCqvV The reality is that climate change is an existential threat to our planet and we need bold change to combat it. Yesterday I was proud to join my colleagues to introduce a Green New Deal resolution. https://t.co/OUJdMuKFCb It's so important that sexual assault survivors have access to comprehensive &amp; responsive health care services. That's why my colleagues &amp; I recently introduced a bill to expand access to care for survivors &amp; gather data on how to improve the care they receive. We must take action in response to the tragic deaths of two young children in CBP custody last year. I introduced a bill today to provide Border Patrol agents with medical training to treat the injuries of those they encounter along the border. This is extremely troubling. Consumers have a fundamental right to the privacy of their data. That’s why I recently called for the FCC and FTC to investigate how these wireless companies are using location data. https://t.co/imDWr2knNL The Trump administration should not force foreign NGOs to choose between receiving our aid or providing comprehensive reproductive health care to women across the world. Today my colleagues &amp; I introduced a bill to permanently repeal the harmful Global Gag Rule. The Green New Deal resolution we introduced today is a critical step toward tackling the climate change crisis. I look forward to working with my colleagues on policies to protect our environment, create jobs for a clean economy &amp; build a sustainable and equitable future. “The pain of losing a child to gun violence never ends. And it’s that pain that drives me to do this work to prevent gun violence.”
 
@RepLucyMcBath lost her son to gun violence in 2012 and is now in Congress advocating for common sense gun safety policies. We must listen to her. https://t.co/e4k8oJJyGT Earlier today at a Judiciary Committee meeting a number of my colleagues &amp; I spoke out against the Administration’s continued efforts to ram through extreme judicial nominees for lifetime appointments to the bench. This is simply absurd. We must urgently address the climate change crisis before it’s too late. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of a bold Green New Deal resolution. Many farm workers often work over 12 hours a day in the hot sun. It's outrageous they don't receive overtime pay for the work they do. I've re-introduced a bill today to grant farm workers overtime protections &amp; eliminate most minimum wage exemptions they face. RT @SFPD: Motorists should continue to avoid  Geary Blvd. between Spruce &amp; Stanyon to enable fire cleanup. Residents and workers should con… Right now drug companies can abuse our patent system by jacking up prices on drugs when there are no affordable alternatives for patients to turn to. This is unconscionable &amp; needs to stop. My colleagues and I introduce legislation today that would prevent this from happening. Please heed evacuation orders and follow @SFFDPIO for safety info. Grateful for the first responders on the scene. Stay safe out there. https://t.co/pcgH9XoMNx So proud of my dear friend @staceyabrams for speaking truth to power last night about the real issues facing Americans across the country &amp; the challenges to our democracy today. Don’t miss it if you haven't seen it. https://t.co/qkeOaqO8NT Honored to mark #BlackHistoryMonth today by joining this panel with current &amp; former Black U.S. Senators in front of HBCU representatives from across the country. We've come a long way from a gathering like this being completely unimaginable in America.  https://t.co/OZI7ib0EKv Andrew Wheeler is a climate change skeptic and former coal lobbyist who is now one step closer to becoming the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is absurd. I firmly oppose his nomination and urge my colleagues to do the same. https://t.co/ej8O5NVqEc Aretha Franklin's songs were the soundtrack of my childhood. I can still remember standing in the living room dancing to Rock Steady over and over again. She was simply a legend, and I'm proud today to re-introduce a bill that would honor her with a Congressional Gold Medal. No matter what we hear tonight, remember this: The strength of our union has never been found in the walls we build. It’s in our diversity and our unity – and that is our power. https://t.co/f1ytQq0o0T Headed over to give my thoughts ahead of the president’s State of the Union Address. As leaders, we must commit ourselves to speaking truth &amp; fighting for an America that works for everyone. Tune in here to watch live momentarily --&gt;  https://t.co/J944ScCiVq So great to visit with Trisha, my guest tonight for the State of the Union! https://t.co/hDJ6Ck5GUd This is absurd. Special Counsel Bob Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation without interference and his report must be made public. https://t.co/SBN4YPjo0o Here's the bottom line: survivors of sexual assault should not be blamed for the trauma they've experienced. Neomi Rao's prior writings about sexual assault are completely unacceptable and her responses to my questions today were deeply troubling. https://t.co/jlOuhHWtQx My guest tonight for the State of the Union is Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, who was furloughed during the government shutdown while still recovering from losing her family’s home in a California wildfire. She is the definition of resilience and I'm proud to have her here with me. https://t.co/PFKuw1r3CI NEWS: I'm delivering remarks tonight on Facebook Live ahead of the President’s State of the Union Address. It's critical we speak truth to the American people during this inflection moment in our country's history. Tune in at approximately 7:45PM ET --&gt; https://t.co/J944ScCiVq The spirit of the census is that everyone is counted - including rural communities. California Complete Count will hold a webinar on February 21 on efforts to reach rural communities through the first ever “digital census.” Be sure to register &amp; attend. https://t.co/B7kFuS82fJ On Rosa Parks’ birthday, I’m honoring her legacy by recommitting myself to fight for justice &amp; equality. The courage she embodied during the Civil Rights movement continues to give me the strength to be the joyful warrior I am today. How are you remembering Rosa Parks? It’s unacceptable that the President is considering going around Congress to fund his ridiculous border wall by raiding funds meant to protect communities from natural disasters. I’m proud to introduce a bill today to make sure that doesn’t happen. Mrs. Shelton was a second mother to me and I don’t know where I’d be without her. I’m thinking about her this #BlackHistoryMonth and the countless Black women just like her who continue to build and shape our communities. https://t.co/ndu4XVkTvP David Bernhardt's nomination to lead the Interior Department is an affront to the Department's mission of protecting our natural resources. We're talking about a fossil fuel lobbyist with a history of fighting against environmental protections. Americans deserve better. Millions of Californians enjoy boating, fishing, hunting &amp; viewing wildlife in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta &amp; we must preserve that opportunity for generations to come. Today @SenFeinstein @RepGaramendi &amp; I introduced a bill to establish the Delta as a National Heritage Area. This is horrifying &amp; should never happen in America.
 
“…I saw a young man on the floor, holding a bright red inhaler, and he was saying through tears that he doesn’t know if he’s going to wake up tomorrow…This man is pre-trial…”  https://t.co/aqs5e1ovRt This is a human rights abuse committed by the United States government. We need to hold this Administration accountable for its completely inhumane treatment of these children and their families. I'll say it again: Secretary Nielsen must resign. https://t.co/ddbwQrpdDu Our military must not be used for political purposes, and this Administration has given us no reason to believe that this is anything but a grave misuse of our military resources. We need answers. https://t.co/QFEmZTypUX My heart goes out to the family of Jeff Dye, a Ventura County Sheriff’s search and rescue team member who tragically lost his life today while attempting to help others in need.

This was one of my favorite projects I got to work on with my late press secretary Tyrone Gayle. https://t.co/OoqGtC7cCV Title IX protections for student survivors of sexual assault are under attack. This week my colleagues &amp; I called on Secretary DeVos to rescind her proposal to weaken these protections. This simply would not make our students safer at a time when they should be seen &amp; heard. This is a troubling retreat from an international arms treaty that has made America safer for over 30 years. My colleagues &amp; I have introduced a bill to require the Administration be transparent on this before it rushes into a new arms race with Russia. https://t.co/NYtVlW86We This #BlackHistoryMonth I’m thinking about great leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. &amp; Rosa Parks but also the countless unsung Black men &amp; women who've shaped our country's history. They've given me reason to believe, “Yes, I’m Black. I’m proud of it. I’m Black and beautiful.” I’m thrilled to announce Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik as my guest to this year’s State of the Union. Trisha &amp; her husband both went without a paycheck during the shutdown while rebuilding their home after losing it in a wildfire. America needs to hear their story. https://t.co/nTU5nU9Xgy Jackie Robinson may have been born in Georgia but his life &amp; historic career in California make him one of our state's most legendary figures. Jackie made it possible for the countless Black baseball players who came after him. Today would have been his 100th birthday. https://t.co/mV2aPxDVkZ UPDATE: FEMA has extended the deadline to register for individual financial assistance! If you are a survivor of the wildfires in Butte, Los Angeles, and Ventura Counties please call (800) 621-3362 or visit https://t.co/83uWacrEMw to register by February 15. This Administration is packing the court that protected Dreamers from deportation and blocked the unconstitutional transgender military ban. We need nominees who will uphold equality and justice. Until a fair process is in place, I will oppose every nominee to an appellate court. This is heartbreaking. As we continue to see the consequences of the government shutdown, one thing remains clear: all of this was completely avoidable. https://t.co/mAb9vbiD68 Despite what this Administration says, children are still being ripped away from their parents. In this case, I’m so grateful for the advocacy of @ConMijente &amp; proud of my case work team who fought hard to reunite this 1-year-old with her mother at SFO last night. https://t.co/eUvU6k6BoB As a student at @HowardU I was proud to walk the same halls as some of my heroes like Thurgood Marshall. But right now many of the historic sites &amp; buildings at HBCUs are deteriorating &amp; we need to act. Today I re-introduced a bill to improve HBCU campuses across the county. I've said this many times &amp; will say it again: everyone has a fundamental right to drink clean water. The Administration should take steps to protect Americans from these chemicals that are already impacting the water supplies of millions of Americans. https://t.co/Ulckt8NZbx The spirit of the Census is that no one should go uncounted, but this Administration has deliberately proposed changes to intimidate immigrants and keep them from participating. That's why my colleagues &amp; I re-introduced a bill to ensure the Census is conducted in a fair manner. I asked DNI Coats this same question almost one year ago: is there a written strategy for the intelligence community on how to confront the threat from foreign influence campaigns on social media? I still have not received a sufficient answer. https://t.co/TBKp9rAlpJ Californians: There are only three days left to register for FEMA individual financial assistance if you are a survivor of the wildfires in Butte, Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Call (800) 621-3362 or visit https://t.co/KGW2FPDt8x to register with FEMA by January 31. To clarify, although the website notes January 28 as the deadline to comment, the Department of Education will accept comments through January 30. Speak out now before it’s too late. REMINDER: Tomorrow is the last day to comment on the Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX. These changes would pose a cruel burden on survivors of sexual assault who have a right to feel safe &amp; be heard. Make sure to speak out --&gt; https://t.co/3aMEKMQbe0 Let's be clear: women's reproductive healthcare is standard healthcare, and having access to routine screenings is so critical to preventing cervical cancer as well as other serious illnesses. Thank you @DrLeanaWen for sharing this powerful story. https://t.co/qOUlrj1rAa We still need long-term reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. We cannot allow for survivors of domestic violence &amp; sexual assault to be withheld the aid and services they need. This is non-negotiable. https://t.co/3TQ3Xa71nk “To be young, gifted, and black...” Congrats to the cast of Black Panther, this was a well-deserved win. #WakandaForever   https://t.co/BNj3PU17ar RT @ChrisVanHollen: Now that the longest government shutdown in history is finally over, the Trump Administration needs to provide back pay… No parent in this country should be afraid to seek out critical medical care for their child, period. https://t.co/NDvYIJ8DPf The shutdown was not only completely avoidable but also downright irresponsible, and these numbers confirm that. The President cannot continue to place politics over the lives of hardworking Americans. https://t.co/L3ImPbvPdF No one should be fired because of who they love, period. https://t.co/m19aItAmLh It is a disgrace that hundreds of thousands of American workers and their families had to suffer because of this senseless shutdown. Americans have a fundamental right to expect their location data is protected, but wireless companies have repeatedly shown disregard for this. Yesterday my colleagues &amp; I demanded the FCC &amp; FTC investigate how these companies are using location data. https://t.co/ZOuF5Hs4rC Enough is enough. The government needs to be re-opened. Today. https://t.co/d41JJObDuT This morning’s news is yet another sign that Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation free of interference - and his report must be made public. These are real $0 paycheck stubs from federal workers in California who won’t get paid tomorrow because of this shutdown. Everything from mortgages &amp; student loans to putting food on the table is on the line for them. https://t.co/r39dOFjniw Tomorrow, federal workers will not receive a paycheck for the second time. I've heard the stories of folks who are standing in food lines and working around the clock without being paid. 

This is the height of irresponsibility. They don't want a wall. They want a paycheck. You can still comment on the Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX through January 30. Survivors of sexual assault have a right to feel safe and to be seen &amp; heard. It’s critical that we all make our voices heard. https://t.co/3aMEKMQbe0 I am voting YES on a clean bill to end this shutdown and put 800,000 federal employees back to work. Republicans unanimously supported this plan in December—but now they’re playing politics with people’s lives.

Enough. Let’s re-open the government today. It's been 34 days since the government shut down. The Senate will vote on a clean bill today to fund the government that we unanimously approved one month ago. Let’s get this done. 800,000 federal workers are counting on us. There are FBI employees currently furloughed. There are DHS employees working unpaid &amp; stretching their hours. It's the height of hypocrisy to suggest that a border wall is about securing our nation. If you want our nation secure, you’d pay the folks whose job it is to do that. Everyone has a fundamental right to breathe clean air but right now more than 4 in 10 Americans live in places where air pollution is a serious health concern. That’s why we must continue to fight for cleaner air &amp; stronger protections under the Clean Air Act. #HealthyAirForAll This is a disgrace, and these survivors deserve better. https://t.co/7Nf4XnSFEs It’s been 46 years since the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling &amp; one thing remains clear: we must continue to fight. A woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body and her future is at stake. Welcome news out of New York. The abhorrent practice of conversion therapy needs to be banned nationwide. https://t.co/uXkeIHhZyv Let me be very clear: the hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who aren’t getting their paychecks are not bargaining chips. The President must end this senseless shutdown immediately and reopen the government. This harms the trans Americans who currently selflessly serve our country and our national security. We must continue to fight this discriminatory ban. https://t.co/QtEkH82Ttw I often look to the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration. These words ring especially true today: “The time is always right to do what is right.” 

Let’s recommit to fighting for the very best of who we are &amp; remember to be joyful warriors along the way. #MLKDay The Congressional Black Caucus now has the most members in its history, thanks in part to these amazing newly-elected women. Make sure to give a follow to @RepLucyMcBath @RepJahanaHayes @Ilhan @RepUnderwood and @RepPressley! #FollowFriday https://t.co/6EyU7Ro1E4 Proud to stand with hard working @seiu521 Fresno Superior Court employees as they ask for a fair contract that values the dignity of their work and contribution to the community. The maternal mortality rate in our country is worse than it was 25 years ago. That is outrageous &amp; I will reintroduce legislation this Congress to address this public health crisis. Yesterday I was proud to join with @RepJayapal and @aijenpoo to discuss the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, which we will introduce to guarantee domestic workers the dignity, benefits, and legal protections they deserve. https://t.co/hZ6H3UZJRk The President must end this shutdown now. In the meantime, we must ensure Americans going without their paychecks can pay their bills &amp; provide for their families. I’ve cosponsored a bill so that they can receive unemployment benefits until this political stunt by the WH is over. This is confirming what we already knew: the President’s tax scam is a gift to corporations. The American people deserve better than this. That’s why I’ve introduced a real tax cut for middle class families. https://t.co/efIvczZQH9 This week @SenFeinstein &amp; I reintroduced a bill to establish a national memorial to honor the 431 Californians whose lives were lost in the 1928 St. Francis Dam disaster. This monument will serve as a reminder of the profound consequences of a failure of infrastructure. Reminder that it’s been 27 days since the Violence Against Women Act expired. It’s shameful to cut off funding for programs that provide critical support to survivors of domestic violence &amp; sexual assault. We must re-authorize it immediately. Trisha &amp; her family’s home was destroyed last month in a devastating wildfire. Now she &amp; her husband, both air traffic controllers, aren’t being paid because of the government shutdown. They have 3 young children.
 
The Senate must vote immediately to end this shutdown. https://t.co/wBZk7WGtGp Climate change is here and its effects are already being felt across the world.

The Senate needs to vote on legislation to end the shutdown immediately, and the President must stop holding the American people hostage. https://t.co/OfNXtXqUcI Nobody who works 40 hours a week should struggle to pay the bills or support their families. That’s why I’m standing with my colleagues @SenSanders and @PattyMurray to re-introduce a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2024. Let’s give the American people a real raise. The 116th Congress is more diverse than ever before. I’m proud to stand by these 131 women as we continue to shape this institution to reflect the people we represent. https://t.co/E35ilIki4T I remain firmly against Andrew Wheeler’s nomination.

That is absurd. https://t.co/WeSz2xmZxy 800,000 American workers are missing thousands of dollars in pay all because the President is determined to hold them hostage over his vanity project.

It’s outrageous to consider diverting disaster funding for a border wall. Our people have a right to believe their government will act in their best interest, not act irresponsibly for a vanity project. https://t.co/myPZCgT6tw Another consequence of the shutdown: the EPA can’t monitor whether companies are emitting illegal levels of contaminants into our air or water. https://t.co/5ebcdYO521 The real crisis in our country today is that we have a President who is putting politics over the needs of the American public. https://t.co/yy38A9NGEz It's being reported that air traffic controllers were just cut a $0 paycheck because of the Trump shutdown. https://t.co/UJPs8G1Ihp The American people have an absolute right to the privacy of their data.

We should do that today before any families miss a paycheck. The President did nothing tonight to offer a solution to families who will miss their paychecks this Friday. He needs to stop this self-made crisis and open the government. Right now, suicide rates are so high that life expectancy is declining in our country.

Last week, the House approved legislation to re-open the government. Senate Republicans should allow a vote on it immediately.

Americans should be able to go to a bowling alley and be safe. We need to make America’s tax code work for working people. Instead of more tax breaks for the top 1% and corporations, we should be passing a real tax cut for the middle class. Yesterday, I reintroduced my bill, the LIFT the Middle Class Act.

It’s shameful to withhold this critical support for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Congress must re-authorize it immediately. It’s now almost two weeks since the government shut down with hundreds of thousands of federal workers being left without pay. Last night, the House passed a bill to re-open the government. The Senate should vote on it immediately. Congress showered corporations and the 1% with more than a trillion dollars in tax breaks last year under the guise of a middle-class tax cut. That’s not right. Today, I introduced my LIFT the Middle Class Act – a real tax cut for the middle class. Mexico isn’t paying for the wall and spending $5 billion for it is a complete waste of taxpayer money. https://t.co/hfg5PDxzrq If the shutdown continues not only will federal employees not get their paychecks…Americans won’t be getting their tax refunds either. https://t.co/yKaddMZjRO The very first bill I’m introducing today, on the first day of the 116th Congress, is a real tax cut for the middle class.

History. https://t.co/MtoI0Or0mg HISTORIC NEWS: the anti-lynching bill I introduced with @CoryBooker &amp; @SenatorTimScott just passed the Senate unanimously.

But let’s be clear about what Russia did when they interfered in the 2016 election. They came into our house. They manipulated us. They provoked us. They tried to turn us against each other. https://t.co/e5x4QQHvqz Despite these concerns, overall, this measure takes positive steps to improve our justice system, and I intend to vote for it. It should also further expand application of earned good time credits, place more prohibitions on private prisons which profit from the incarceration of individuals, and further limit the use of electronic monitoring. To start: all of the bill’s sentencing reforms should be applied retroactively. But, to be clear, the FIRST STEP Act is very much just that – a first step. It is a compromise of a compromise, and we ultimately need to make far greater reforms if we are to right the wrongs that exist in our criminal justice system. It also enables the use of good time credits, provides greater access to education and substance abuse treatment. It eliminates the shackling of pregnant prisoners, requires healthcare products for incarcerated women, and ends federal juvenile solitary confinement. It allows judges greater discretion to reduce unfair sentences for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders and eliminate unjust sentencing enhancement. This bill reforms some of the most draconian federal sentencing laws, including unfair mandatory minimum sentences under two- and three-strikes laws, and retroactively applying the reduced sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. For too long sentencing has been overly severe &amp; disproportionately targeted communities of color – especially Black men. Americans deserve a criminal justice system that is both fair and smart. By passing the FIRST STEP Act, we can start to make our criminal justice system smarter. I wanted to share my thoughts with you all in a quick thread on the FIRST STEP Act, a criminal justice reform bill that the Senate will begin voting on tonight. In many places across the country, today is the last day to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. (Californians, remember that you have until January 15 to sign up.)
