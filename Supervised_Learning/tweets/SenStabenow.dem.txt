It was wonderful to congratulate Blaine and Kim Baker, recipients of MSU‚Äôs Dairy Farmers of the Year award. These 5th generation Lenawee County dairy farmers are leaders in both agriculture and water conservation! https://t.co/0VNhI3P8B3 Great to celebrate Michigan‚Äôs hardworking dairy farmers at the Great Lakes Regional Dairy Conference! Dairy is our top commodity, and they have been going through very tough economic times. So glad my 2018 #FarmBill provides much better support for our producers. Ray, thank you for your hard work, your leadership, and your dedication to MI agriculture. Enjoy your retirement- you‚Äôve earned it! @michigansugarco https://t.co/4dYvlEK8Bc There can be no better name for the new @USNavy warship.

https://t.co/4Fn92mNyh4 John D. Dingell ‚Äì true Michigan and American legend, the Dean of the House and my longtime friend. We have been incredibly lucky to have you and will miss you dearly. Sending my love to @RepDebDingell and all of John‚Äôs loved ones in this difficult time. Her legacy and contributions to the arts, civil rights and the City of Detroit will never be forgotten. Aretha Franklin‚Äôs voice and soul were truly larger than life. Awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal is a perfect way to honor her during Black History Month. https://t.co/lCQZTiG1D2 I wasn‚Äôt sleeping. I was trying not to scream. https://t.co/NjIZbzoDim Our love and prayers are with you and John. https://t.co/z1WHzFzsVf I am deeply concerned about the direction of our country reflected in the President‚Äôs #SOTU. We need to come together and find bipartisan solutions on issues important to Michigan like fixing our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, lowering the cost of health care &amp; keeping jobs in the U.S. Our bill would make sure that Michigan priorities like the Soo Locks, dredging of our harbors, and stopping Asian carp aren‚Äôt zeroed out for President Trump‚Äôs unnecessary wall. An emergency declaration by President Trump would divert critical funding away from Michigan. https://t.co/0yocpsOuIV Very concerning that special interests like the Koch Brothers are influencing our nation‚Äôs response to PFAS contamination in our drinking water. The Administration should be putting the health and safety of our families first!
https://t.co/nHlLZ39Ty9 I agree. It is outrageous that corporate shareholders are getting richer while workers are not being paid a decent wage. https://t.co/LsbqWzBJbW Looking forward to watching all those with Michigan connections play today in the @Superbowl! #SBLIII
https://t.co/guEYvCWCgb Today we @GoRedforWomen and stand together to raise awareness for women‚Äôs heart health. https://t.co/AFBxpRQn1Z If the president declares a national emergency to build the wall, I will strongly oppose taking away funding from critical Army Corps projects like the Soo Locks to pay for it. I‚Äôm encouraged by the bipartisan effort to provide funding for smart, effective security at both our northern and southern borders. Leader McConnell needs to make sure this gets a vote. https://t.co/NLcLmrdvlO RT @Morning_Joe: Coming up: @SenStabenow https://t.co/jk9LeESwVB RT @SenJohnBarrasso: Proud to join with @SenStabenow to reintroduce our bipartisan bill that gives our nation‚Äôs seniors, especially in rura‚Ä¶ Our Michigan workers and manufacturers can out-work, out-build, and out-think anyone but they need a level playing field to succeed. The Trump Admin needs to take action NOW, not issue weak Executive Orders like the one today! I also introduced legislation requiring the Trump Administration to release a report on how it is complying with our nation‚Äôs Buy American laws. The report was supposed to be completed by 2017 but it isn‚Äôt available for the public to see! I agree! I cosponsored @SenatorBaldwin‚Äôs Made In America bill last Congress to make sure the federal government is buying American products. https://t.co/NWPnWrWE8W This is wrong. We should be making it easier for Americans to vote and participate in our democracy! https://t.co/tidYrYwlpS More than 50 years ago the #EqualPay Act passed in an attempt to close the gender wage gap. It‚Äôs 2019 &amp; women still make only 80 cents per dollar men make for the same job! I cosponsored the #PaycheckFairness Act to hold employers accountable &amp; ensure equal pay for equal work. Very exciting! @StaceyAbrams is a fighter for health care, voting rights, and the middle class and I can‚Äôt wait to hear from her. https://t.co/Qi8HYPywIR Creative way to announce the snow day.

I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more - it‚Äôs time for change and to pass my legislation to bring down prices once and for all.

https://t.co/pHUKaJhOI3 Happy birthday to our beautiful mitten! https://t.co/ZS0XlHqckp Holding federal workers‚Äô wages hostage was wrong! First step now is to pay them asap. Next step is to make sure this never happens again. Just voted to reopen the government and end this terrible shutdown. We all support strong border security but President Trump needs to stop holding federal workers and their wages hostage. You mean like what we just did with the bipartisan Farm Bill? The President can give me a call anytime about working together on the Soo Locks and other MI priorities. https://t.co/WRwLJBndFK It‚Äôs time for President Trump to end this shutdown so federal workers like Agent Maitland can get paid for the important work they are doing to protect and serve our communities. Border Patrol Agent Brian Maitland and Monroe County Sheriff‚Äôs Deputy Brian Sroka are true heroes whose actions helped save a man‚Äôs life.  https://t.co/11dkRNMlqx So exciting!

https://t.co/XDYWzzyICX Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 90 years old today. His legacy continues to be a true inspiration.

The President should sign it immediately. Most importantly, he needs to act now and reopen the government. It would be outrageous to divert U.S. Army Corps money from critical priorities for Michigan like the Soo Locks, dredging of our harbors, infrastructure for our ports and waterways, and plans to stop Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. https://t.co/6M3FDNFLJd None of this has to be happening. The President can easily end the #TrumpShutdown by signing the bipartisan government funding bills that have been passed by the House and Senate. And beyond SNAP, school meals, support for women, infants, and children, and food for seniors are all at risk if this shutdown does not come to an end. The #TrumpShutdown threatens the 38 million people who rely on SNAP to put food on the table, including many seniors, children, and people with disabilities. They should have long-term certainty that food assistance will be available. It also means many routine food safety inspections have been halted https://t.co/IbQ5noh1vJ The #TrumpShutdown means pollution inspectors aren‚Äôt on the job, potentially putting our health and safety at risk. https://t.co/PTxNvgy5BE Homeowners in small towns and rural communities can‚Äôt get the housing loans they need to pay their mortgages because the USDA Rural Development office is shut down. https://t.co/ygGIA5NotS Local Farm Service offices are closed and farmers can‚Äôt apply for loans they need. Dairy farmers can't access additional support they received in the new Farm Bill. And farmers can't count on important crop reports to make decisions about the upcoming planting season. Every day that USDA is shut down is another day that the improvements we made in the 2018 Farm Bill are delayed and the situation gets more serious for farmers and families. https://t.co/9XCr0ZHb8R The #TrumpShutdown could even hurt our country‚Äôs credit rating the longer it goes on, making it more expensive for families and companies to borrow money. https://t.co/m9DJVhFaFE The #TrumpShutdown means many Michigan workers can‚Äôt pay their bills, some people have been forced to get temporary jobs, and small business owners are losing business because they depend on spending by federal employees. In just two days, the #TrumpShutdown will become the longest government shutdown ever. Here are just a few examples of how it is hurting our country. I am deeply concerned that he will continue Scott Pruitt‚Äôs legacy of undermining protections for our air and water if confirmed as EPA Administrator. The next head of the EPA must stand with us to protect our Great Lakes and make decisions based on sound science. I voted against Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy EPA Administrator because I had no confidence he would do that. https://t.co/FJggwuridU Today and every day, I am grateful for the men and women who keep us safe. #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/jYliVorShA Nothing new after the President‚Äôs speech tonight. We all support strong border security and can continue to debate what that looks like. But it‚Äôs time for President Trump to end this shutdown. This shutdown fight shouldn't be about politics. It‚Äôs about people. And it‚Äôs the American people who are losing. https://t.co/Xj2W8V8sr4 Women should get equal pay for equal work. Period.

https://t.co/LFYVLGhi61 I agree with @ChrisVanHollen. The Senate should vote on the House-passed bills to reopen the government now.

The law @RoyBlunt &amp; I passed in 2014 is already having a huge impact! https://t.co/sY0JKpAAHb Tonight, the House of Representatives passed two bills to re-open the government and help secure the border. The Senate should pass these bills immediately and President Trump should sign them. This government shutdown is hurting Michigan and our country. It is forcing thousands of border agents and TSA officers to work without pay, creating instability for our farmers, and threatening funding for our Great Lakes. This appeal is a good first step. This outrageous ruling that threatens health coverage for millions of Americans must be overturned.https://t.co/6Swf4SF5EY I‚Äôm also so excited to serve with our two new Democratic Senators @SenJackyRosen and @SenatorSinema!

Proud to call her my partner in the fight‚Ä¶ When I was elected to the Senate in 2000, I was the first woman ever to represent Michigan in the Senate. As we kick off the new Congress, I‚Äôm very excited for another first - for the first time ever, one in four Senators will be women. This is not how we should be starting the new year. Congress should take action ASAP to lower the cost of prescription drugs, like passing my bill that would allow Medicare to negotiate the best price for seniors. https://t.co/ehvzyzx6kC .@GretchenWhitmer couldn‚Äôt be more right - we need to come together for a stronger, better Michigan.

https://t.co/j7GMyrB3oq While there is still much more work to be done to ensure fairness and justice for all Americans, this bill is an important step in the right direction and the Senate should pass it.

I continue to call on Trump Admin to follow the recommendations of its own commission to negotiate lower prices &amp; save lives! We are taking action to help address this epidemic. Michigan recently received over $27 million to fund seven behavioral health clinics that help people struggling with substance abuse. These awards are a result of passage of my Excellence in Mental Health Act. https://t.co/bcUsvxWujI This is outrageous.

My focus is the more than 1800 people in Michigan who will be losing their jobs because of GM‚Äôs decision to stop production of certain vehicles and close their plants in Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren. President Trump‚Äôs call to end the electric vehicle tax credit is the exact opposite of what we should be doing right now. This is a time when we should be supporting the new jobs being created for our talented auto workers, not doubling down on policies that will hurt them. https://t.co/YDfKPRw1Q6 These updates, including the construction of a new Poe-sized lock, are vital for our Michigan businesses as well as national defense and will benefit us for years to come. I am proud to have led the legislation to modernize the Soo Locks. It‚Äôs great to see the much-needed updates to our Soo Locks finally moving forward this year. 
 https://t.co/W5TT2FMpb8 I will continue to stand with Michigan's autoworkers and our communities no matter what. As GM considers future investments and products, it is critical that those investments be made in Michigan - not overseas! And most importantly it is critical to find opportunities for the workers who've lost their jobs because of today's announcement. I am deeply disappointed by the GM plant closures announcement today and the devastating impact it will have on our workers, their families and our communities.

https://t.co/sxyrkQibcx This is yet another example of what we can accomplish when we work across the aisle to protect our Great Lakes! I want to thank @SenJohnThune and @SenatorCarper for working with me @senrobportman @SenGaryPeters and members of the Senate Great Lakes delegation to develop a bipartisan compromise on legislation that will help protect the Great Lakes from invasive species. I also told @morningmika and @JoeNBC that I hope Congress can find common ground to lower the cost of prescription drugs and make a major investment in infrastructure. I‚Äôll always continue to work across the aisle to get things done for Michigan. Great to join @Morning_Joe to talk about the women who won in Michigan because of their hard work, ideas and qualifications. https://t.co/S4Bz7lTH1B Amazing wins by @kyrstensinema and @RosenforNevada! Can‚Äôt wait to serve with both of you in the Senate. As I wrote in the @NYTimes, women ran for the top offices in Michigan and won. That‚Äôs a big deal. But what makes Michigan‚Äôs 2018 election results new and important is that our being women wasn‚Äôt the story.

Thank you to all who have served our county! https://t.co/QYH42u1vEp https://t.co/3zf4UKah04 I agree - the new Acting AG should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. https://t.co/bhlyt79xMk My heart goes out to all the victims in another tragic shooting and to their families. Thank you to the brave first responders, including Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a hero who lost his life today. https://t.co/FydCGmqXfK More than 1 million people in Michigan have health care thanks to the ACA! Be sure to check out your health care options and enroll here before December 15! https://t.co/HqoRgUhkyw Michigan grows more tart cherries than any other state. That‚Äôs why I pushed for an important change to level the playing field for our world famous cherries. I‚Äôll keep working with trade officials to hold other countries accountable!
