They say, ‚Äúnever!‚Äù But the frame was invoked. A lot of journalism is subconscious - almost all good public communicators know that, for better or worse.

&amp; That‚Äôs the real tea right there üçµ @brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 I do think it‚Äôs important to note that questions advance certain frames. What 45 *does* understand is that if he can get media to invoke his narrative enough, people will start to believe or operate in it, regardless of truth. Perfect example is the caravan. @sebastian_byron @brianstelter Ok, I laughed at this @brianstelter Got it!

Due to complications from the gov shutdown, I‚Äôm sad to say I‚Äôll miss @jubileefilms‚Äô premiere of Knock Down the House.

This film was made, with love, for people: https://t.co/dLnurOR3ss (To clarify, some may have dropped a sentence here or there - but she was one of the 1st to substantively pick up my campaign + didn‚Äôt dismiss it. She was one of the only reporters to recognize &amp; take it seriously, thanks to her local reporting + expertise on Queens politics.) Public radio is great! As is @ProPublica, @frontlinepbs &amp; a great deal of other incredible outlets worth our support.

Fun fact: after @TYTPolitics, @brigidbergin at @WNYC was the first to ever write about my campaign - almost a year before my primary win. https://t.co/4KJ4CTFxZi Quote tweet got deleted, but - 

I believe workers should enjoy more of the wealth they create, &amp; that democracy belongs in the workplace, too.

GOP believes people should be paid the lowest wages possible, no matter what they produce, so billionaires can scoop up the difference. If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies, anti-trust, corruption, and ways to address it, I recommend checking out @ZephyrTeachout. 

She literally wrote the book on it. The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally &amp; economically unsustainable.

We can‚Äôt simply accept the clich√© that ‚Äújournalism is dying.‚Äù

Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too. Most platforms currently have 0 incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information.

In fact, FB *paid* for info tied to conspiracy theories on those demanding for accountability.

It matters. Soros was the 1st to get mailed a bomb last year.

https://t.co/zaf6NpmKPm Gonna keep it üíØ: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies &amp; concentration of ownership.

Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism.

W/o a wide range of independent outlets &amp; the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble. @conz Just passed your name along.
