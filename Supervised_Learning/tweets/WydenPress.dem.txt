Millions of Ameri‚Ä¶ .@RonWyden: William Barr has been more than clear about where he stands. He believes that the president alone decides when there‚Äôs a threat and, when he does, he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about Congress, judges, the laws or the Constitution. .@RonWyden: Members of both parties have long been concerned about surveillance authorities under FISA or the possible abuse of FISA. But those concerns are small potatoes compared to what Mr. Barr has proposed, which is that the law need not constrain the president at all. .@RonWyden: Fears about Mr. Barr‚Äôs views on surveillance are not conjecture.  They are based on Mr. Barr‚Äôs own testimony. I ask every member of this body to read it and consider what is at stake. .@RonWyden: Mr. Barr‚Äôs dangerous views on executive power have been consistent throughout his career. But in 2003, he laid out in his position that the president is not accountable to surveillance laws and that the president enjoys giant loopholes in the Fourth Amendment. .@RonWyden: As Mr. Barr himself has made clear, he would take us back forty years, to an era before the Church Committee when neither Congress nor the courts had any role at all in checking or overseeing an abusive, out-of-control government. .@RonWyden: Mr. Barr poses a unique threat to the rule of law and the Fourth Amendment. If he is confirmed as attorney general, Mr. Barr could take us back, and not just twelve years to an era of warrantless wiretapping. .@RonWyden: What Mr. Barr has said is that regardless of whether Congress votes for more checks and balances and oversight, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Because Mr. Barr has made it crystal clear that the president can do what he wants. .@RonWyden: There is a bipartisan coalition in the Congress that has fought to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of Americans.  But Mr. Barr‚Äôs views, once I have laid them out today, should frighten every member of this body. .@RonWyden: That brings me to the topic I want to focus on today: Mr. Barr‚Äôs dangerous views on surveillance &amp; his contempt for surveillance laws and the 4th Amendment. This is not a partisan issue. .@RonWyden: I am firmly opposed to the nomination for many reasons, I am deeply concerned about his view that the President is effectively royalty... .@RonWyden is live NOW: https://t.co/S7rKk5ieut .@RonWyden will be on the Senate floor soon, speaking against William Barr‚Äôs nomination to serve as Attorney General.
