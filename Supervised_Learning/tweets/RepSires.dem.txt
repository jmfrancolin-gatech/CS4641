#Maduro está bloqueando el acceso a alimentos y medicamentos, mientras que los niños están enfermos y tienen hambre. Me senté con @VOANoticias, para discutir la necesidad urgente de obtener ayuda humanitaria para el pueblo venezolano y aliviar su sufrimiento. #Venezuela https://t.co/5aO0pTobtZ Spoke with Dr. Srdjan Darmanovic, Minister of Foreign Affairs of #Montenegro, about #NATO, #Russia, and Montenegro’s continued relationship with the U.S. https://t.co/mTiYyNgIKR #Maduro is blocking access to food and medicine while children are sick and hungry. I sat down with the @VOANoticias, to discuss the urgent need get humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people and alleviate their suffering. #Venezuela https://t.co/h9ofsoWGjy I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to @RepDebDingell and her family during this trying time. Congressman Dingell’s legacy will not be soon forgotten. My statement: https://t.co/OKfjjBDuTv I look forward to continuing to defend animals and the environment as I work with my colleagues in the 116th Congress. Click here to find the full Humane Society scorecard: https://t.co/TOFBE4yFlX Thank you to the @HSLF for giving me a 100% on their 2018 Humane Scorecard for my work on animal rights in the 115th Congress. I was proud to support legislation spanning the protection of domestic abuse survivors and their pets to enhancing federal animal abuse statutes. Yesterday I was interviewed by @CNNEE to give my thoughts on the partial government shutdown, the ongoing crisis in #Venezuela, and the Trump Administration’s dangerous and divisive rhetoric about immigrants. https://t.co/bsr8rxry0E I support the Venezuelan people in their effort to restore democracy to their country and urge a Guaidó led transition to call for prompt elections that are free, fair, and transparent. My statement: https://t.co/kNubfNjhIn We must stand on the side of the Venezuelan people, which is why I have joined the international community in recognizing Juan Guaidó as the constitutionally legitimate Interim President of #Venezuela. The political crisis in #Venezuela is a battle between dictatorship and democracy. #Maduro has created a society in which 90% of Venezuelans are living in poverty, and the people have demanded change. Met with Anita Kober and Robert LaMorte, directors from @NJEA to discuss the need to invest in our public schools and keep our students safe. https://t.co/F0i7esG5Wh Thank you, Rodrigo Masses, Chairman of the Puerto Rico Manufacturing Association and former Representative Jerry Weller, for stopping today to discuss tax policy &amp; the need to reconstruct sustainable energy infrastructure in #PuertoRico. https://t.co/DKcK5pXqv7 Attended this year's first @TransportDems hearing on the cost of not investing in infrastructure. I spoke on the importance of the #GatewayProject for the region and the country. We cannot afford to ignore Gateway any longer. https://t.co/ju7BRpzXmo Proof that #Maduro is preventing much needed supplies from the Venezuelan people. https://t.co/4SIH0n9N0Z Venezuelans cannot feed their families or get the medicine they need, and Maduro is blocking aid for his people. Yesterday, I sat down with Charge de Affairs @carlosvecchio to discuss this heartbreaking crisis and the democratic paths to a solution. #ElMundoEstaConVzla https://t.co/KkypsN1KJB By the end of last year, #Peru was hosting 414,000 Venezuelans and remains a critical partner in solving this crisis. We must continue working together toward democracy and rule of law.  #ElMundoEstaConVzla This afternoon, I sat down with Ambassador Hugo de Zela, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of #Peru, to discuss U.S.-Peru relations and how to best support the people of #Venezuela. https://t.co/9zGujDXDlm Today, I attended the @HouseForeign  hearing to focus on the current challenges in #Yemen. https://t.co/6JFpb9ErgH We stand in support of Panama’s efforts to eradicate social inequality and to adopt sustainable development. VP Saint Malo and I also discussed our continued efforts to support the people of #Venezuela and their return to a true democracy. #ElMundoEstaConVzla Earlier today, I had the honor of meeting @IsabelStMalo, first female VP of #Panama, to discuss a continued partnership between Panama and the United States. https://t.co/09ZmnVgxzu The House passed my rail safety oversight bill today. HR543, which directs the @USDOTFRA to inform Congress whenever it is conducting a safety review of intercity or commuter rail transit agency, now heads to the Senate. My statement here: https://t.co/2n8IWQ6SKu https://t.co/vCOMXt9Qrt While President Trump scorns undocumented workers, his businesses were built on their backs. My statement on the sadly unsurprising hypocrisy of Trump National Golf Clubs employing undocumented immigrants: https://t.co/0BJyMiUvKF Looking ahead at tonight’s #SOTU, I remain skeptical that a leader who is so unreliable as a partner in government can deliver on promises and policies that are in the best interest of the nation. My statement: https://t.co/yjOjYBVsHh Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy and working to preserve freedom of speech and pushing back against those who seek to quiet their dissenters should be a top priority when engaging with our neighbors in the region. Reports that the Maduro regime is detaining foreign journalists are alarming and just another example of how Maduro and his cronies trample on civil rights. #Venezuela I am proud to join @RepShalala in introducing legislation to ban the export of arms and crime control materials to security forces in Venezuela. Full statement: https://t.co/VytNOWA4GQ https://t.co/2ZLiEmNtoi Head Start is essential to the progress early childhood care &amp; education across the country &amp; I will continue to advocate for support of this vital program. https://t.co/s5xm7BPQF7 Earlier today, members from North Hudson Community Action Corporation’s Head Start Program &amp; other state programs stopped by my office. Joined @GovMurphy, @RepBonnie, and other members of the NJ delegation on an inspection of the Hudson River Tunnel. The #GatewayProject is critical to getting this century-old infrastructure repaired. I will keep working to make it happen. https://t.co/s1xBsAA9Tz I will fight to strengthen Social Security, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Social Security 2100. #Secure2100 Sat down with Tim Hunt, Vice President and other members of the NJ chapter of the United Postmasters and Managers of America. We were able to discuss various matters including effort to ensure that the @USPS continues to serve all Americans. https://t.co/qIN42igdHT Had the pleasure of meeting with Close Up students from the Simon Youth Academy of Elizabeth to discuss the importance of youth civic engagement and the important role young people play in our democracy. https://t.co/j0a8CUXiQm I am honored to be selected by my peers as the new Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee for the 116th Congress. I look forward to working with our neighbors to promote peace, prosperity, &amp; security in the region. My statement: https://t.co/BrZbSwaNYj The Hudson Tunnel Project is the most urgent infrastructure project in the country and Trump admin should advance it. Today, I led a letter with my NJ colleagues to @DOT asking that it eliminate redundancies and advance the Project. Full statement here: https://t.co/wLgVZXpKPn I'm on my way to meet with @GovMurphy, @SenatorMenendez, @BillPascrell, and @RepDonaldPayne to inspect the damage on the Hudson River Tunnel and highlight the importance of the #GatewayProject. On #HolocaustMemorialDay we honor all the victims who lost their lives to such senseless violence. #WeRemember the global sorrow that hate inflicted and condemn anti-Semitism along with bigotry and hate in all its forms. The past 35 days have yielded only sorrow and frustration for hundreds of thousands of families across the country. Hard working Americans shouldn’t have their paychecks held to further policy negotiations. While I’m happy that the shutdown has ended, short term CRs are not a responsible way to fund the federal government. We must ensure that all departments receive adequate funding so they can plan and execute vital work. The shutdown is severely impacting our national airspace. Groundings at @LGAairport and severe delays at @EWRairport are signs that the system is breaking down. This shutdown needs to end. My full statement here: https://t.co/1ubkHnvHa3 I strongly urge the @Senatemajldr to get on board and work for the people – not just @PresidentTrump. H.R. 648 is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that improves border security while ensuring that Americans are paid for their work. It is time to end the #TrumpShutdown This bipartisan compromise legislation was negotiated by members of the House and Senate last year and has funding for ports of entry security improvements, hiring additional immigration judges, and assistance in Cent. America to address root causes of migration. H.R. 648, which passed by a vote of 234 to 180, provides funding for 8 of the shuttered government agencies and includes over $1.6 billion for border security measures. Today House Democrats once again voted on a bill that will help reopen the government and #EndTheShutdown. For far too long American families have been held hostage and are facing serious financial problems because of the #TrumpShutdown I hope that Mr. Guaidó can restore democratic institutions in the country and commit to protecting civil liberties and human rights for all. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/K3yhz7gl7X Maduro’s authoritarian regime has devastated the Venezuelan people, who have long called for a return to democracy. RT @brianschatz: They need paychecks, not food banks. https://t.co/ISBYuSeHvd I stand in solidarity with the people of #Venezuela, #Maduro and his cronies must go and stop standing in the way of a return to democracy in #Venezuela. #22Ene See my full statement here: https://t.co/HZBVA2QVWn On this day 61 years ago, the people of #Venezuela ousted an oppressive dictatorship and now they are rising up again. It is clear the socialist experiment in Venezuela has failed, leading #Maduro and his cronies to think only of themselves and their bank accounts. I vow to work with my colleagues to combat prejudice and discrimination and fight for those who sacrifice themselves in service to our country. This directive undermines the foundational values of our society and I am deeply concerned by any court rulings that could result in this ban being implemented. The Administration’s ban prohibiting transgender individuals from military service is institutionalized discrimination. On this #MLKDay we remember and honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for his courageous acts to fight for freedom and justice. #Cuba subverts justice and the #democracy of #Colombia by protecting those responsible for last week's bombing. ELN must return immediately. My statement: https://t.co/OxhbXVW9Oc I’m proud to introduce along with @BobbyScott, The Raise the Wage Act of 2019. The American people deserve to earn a living wage and I urge the House to pass this important legislation. See my full statement here: https://t.co/jvQgHiwwOZ Today marks 4 weeks since the federal government was fully funded. We need to reopen the government and ensure that federal workers across the country have financial security.  Enough is enough @senatemajldr hold a vote to end the #TrumpShutdown Read my full statement here on the House of Representative’s vote disapproving of the Administration’s decision to rollback sanctions on companies associated with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch: https://t.co/ZxKjUqBE84 My thoughts today are with the loved ones of yesterday’s tragedy in #Bogota. Senseless, cowardly violence will not shake the strength of the people of #Colombia. Those responsible for this attack must be swiftly brought to justice. Earlier today, I welcomed @USAIDMarkGreen to discuss the importance of continued engagement and investment in US interests in #WHEM. https://t.co/esVbwT2bmX I am pleased to introduce H.R. 543, this bill requires @USDOTFRA to provide Congress with notice when a safety audit is being conducted on an intercity or commuter rail transit agency that serves their district. See my full statement here: https://t.co/NsmGJRIAH2 Sat down with @CharlesARodrig2, to discuss the importance of #PuertoRico gaining #statehood and restoring Puerto Rico’s financial status. https://t.co/M1GXa7KqVC I remind @senatemajldr that Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government and therefore our actions should be based on the will of the American people, not just the will of one man at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The House of Representatives is working every day to reopen the government because it is our duty to return stability to the 800,000 impacted federal employees, their children, their parents, their friends, and their communities. To date, the House of Representatives has sent six shutdown related bills to the Senate and none of them have been taken up. Another resolution that the House voted on, funding the Department of Homeland Security through February 8, 2019, passed the Senate just days before the shutdown began. @senatemajldr claims none of the House’s resolutions are workable, yet a set of these resolutions, reopening six of the nine impacted agencies, passed in the Senate last year by a vote of 92-6. Since the start of the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed numerous bills that would end the government shutdown while the Senate has not voted on a single bill to reopen shuttered agencies. Today is the 26th day of the partial government shutdown and it is long past time for the Senate to vote on reasonable legislation. Today, it is my honor to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore on the House Floor and oversee the morning hour. https://t.co/Hrz5JoD9nB “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”- #MLK. Today we honor a true inspiration to the American people as we recognize his 90th birthday. Their shameless discrimination and oppression of ethnic and religious minorities is a disgrace and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to shine a light on these brutal tactics. We must not allow #China to continue getting away with punishing innocent civilians. Today I met with advocates to discuss the terrible #HumanRights abuses taking place at the hands of the Chinese government against the #Uighur population.  Millions of people are being unjustly imprisoned in concentration camps and having their basic rights violated. It is important to conduct a census which is comprehensive and accurate. I will continue to work with my colleagues in advocating for the removal of a citizenship question from the 2020 Census. I welcome the ruling of U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman blocking the Administration’s addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. This question would discourage census participation which is used to calculate critical resources for states and communities. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I pledge to work diligently with my colleagues to determine if the President is negotiating away America’s security behind closed doors. The American people deserve to know the truth. My full statement here: https://t.co/db846pH4cD It is deeply troubling that President Trump has reportedly gone to great lengths to conceal the contents of his conversation with Vladimir Putin. This continues the President’s reckless trend of emboldening leaders that actively seek to undermine American national security. I applaud the passage of this bill which provides critical resources to help some of the most vulnerable in our communities. It now awaits further action in the Senate. Today, the House passed H.R. 430, the TANF Extension Act of 2019 which will temporarily extend much needed assistance to low income American families with children. #Maduro continues his attempts to extinguish democracy from #Venezuela. I am grateful that Juan Gaudió is home safe and can continue to lift the oppressed voices of Venezuelans against this brutal regime. My statement: https://t.co/PVpohIxmCR Raising the rate which banks can devote to Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) will accelerate American entrepreneurship – growing small businesses &amp; our local economies. More info can be found here: https://t.co/5eg9czmJyA Going to the @HouseFloor to vote on H.R. 116, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2019 – bipartisan legislation to increase capital investment in small businesses. Please see my weekly Washington Review for a recap of what I focused on this past week in Congress: https://t.co/Mur2YWD2zr I’m pleased that H.R. 266 passed by a vote of 240 to 179 on the House Floor. I call on @SenateMajLdr to take up the numerous bills passed by the House that would end this shutdown. This bill would fund the Department of Interior and its agencies at last year’s funding level. This would reopen museums, put park rangers back to work, restart the EPA’s conservation work, and gives thousands of federal workers the pay they’ve earned. Shutting down our parks, shuttering conservation programs, and keeping paychecks from the men and women who keep it all running is immoral. Today, the House is voting on H.R. 266, which would fund the Dept of Interior and all the agencies it oversees. Large numbers of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staff have been furloughed, putting a stop to health enforcement activities and state grant allocations. Essential staff is still working on disaster response issues but they are working without pay. The #TrumpShutdown has effectively shut down services at national parks and nearly 3/4ths of Interior Department staff furloughed raising the risk of visitors getting hurt and of misuse of the lands. We have a responsibility to carry on this legacy of conservation for future generations – just as our predecessors did for us. Our national parks are our natural heritage – decades of conservation work have made it possible for our generation to enjoy the bounty of our nation’s natural wonders. I call on @SenateMajLdr to hold a vote on these, and other key appropriations bills so that we can end the #TrumpShutdown and restore order to the federal government. These two pieces of legislation would open vital federal agencies and restore stability to thousands of families across the country which is why I just voted for them on the House Floor.  H.R. 265 passed by a vote of 243 to 183 and H.R. 267, passed by a vote of 244 to 180. and stolen millions of dollars on the backs of the Venezuelan people. I stand firmly with the Venezuelan people and applaud our friends and neighbors in the region who will not recognize his presidency. See my full statement here: https://t.co/0lTlb9NTDK #Maduro and his regime has run #Venezuela in the ground, and his inauguration is a complete sham and a slap in the face to the Venezuelan people. #Maduro has ordered his cronies to violently oppress the peaceful opposition And the shutdown has threatened state highway and transit construction projects, many of which are funded by Congressional grants. Passing H.R. 267 keeps these projects running. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseen by the Department of Transportation, has been forced to stop its work on thousands of safety investigations. H.R. 267 keeps puts this critical agency back to work on behalf of all Americans' safety. Passing H.R. 267 puts these important agencies and workers back to work with the pay they earn for keeping our skies safe. The shutdown has forced the FAA to suspend processing of pilot background checks, putting new pilot hires on hold. Our nation already has a shortage of qualified pilots. Also, our nation's Air Traffic Control (ATC) operators, who keep our airspace orderly and safe, are working without pay and training of new ATC staff has been suspended. Currently, the majority of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) staff who work to certify aircraft safety have been furloughed. H.R. 267 would reopen the Department of Transportation, restart safety and oversight programs currently on pause, and pay the Americans who keep us safe. Currently, individuals trying to use a Federal Housing Administration loan to purchase a home are facing delays because of the staff shortages and the delays could grow the longer the agency is impacted by the shutdown. By passing H.R. 267 we could ensure that these inspections resume and rent assistance programs receive funding – eliminating the risk of evictions due to lapse in coverage. Thousands of people rely on rental assistance programs that are funded through HUD and the shutdown is unnecessarily putting these individuals at risk of eviction if it lasts long enough that previously appropriated money runs out. 95% of staff at the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been furloughed and health and safety inspections of housing for the elderly, disabled, and low-income families have been suspended. H.R. 267 would fund key agencies under the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development that have been drastically impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. In addition, this bill would fund the Department of Agriculture – including conservation programs, food safety and inspection, agricultural research, as well as loan and grant programs to help farmers and the undeserved in rural areas across the country. Also included in H.R. 265, is funding for the Food and Drug Administration, which during the #TrumpShutdown has stopped some of its routine food safety inspections due to forced furloughs. Without additional funding, millions of families who rely on SNAP for basic nutrition will face extreme uncertainty as the Trump administration could not ensure that the benefits would continue if the #TrumpShutdown continues until March. Under H.R. 265, $103 billion would be provided for domestic food assistance programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and school breakfast and lunch programs. These bills would reopen a number of departments impacted by the #TrumpShutdown and restore vital operations that millions of Americans rely on every day.  So let’s break down what is covered by each bill. Today, the House of Representatives will be voting on two appropriations bills – H.R. 265, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act and H.R. 267, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Act. Great speaking with David Gutierrez, the Ambassador of Belize, I look forward to a continued relationship between the U.S. and Belize. https://t.co/1RLmfhAfgb Going to the House Floor to vote on a bill that would reopen a portion of the government currently effected by the #TrumpShutdown.  By reopening the IRS we can ensure that Americans do not face significant delays in their tax refunds. @RealDonaldTrump, you should help Americans manage their forests instead of keeping critical government assistance from them - and this tweet doesn’t change the fact that FEMA is one of the agencies shuttered thanks to the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/P3ZDDm1Lyk Earlier, I discussed the value of Taiwan’s involvement in Latin America and the need for continued engagement with Alexander Tah-Ray Yui, The Taiwanese Director General of the Department of Latin America. https://t.co/Z1lS4RBlDA As an immigrant and the Representative for the 8th District of New Jersey, I reject the President’s fear mongering and believe that America will always be great so long as we remember our creation as a country of immigrants. He claimed migrants are causing a humanitarian crisis at the border, but the true humanitarian crisis stems from President Trump’s complete repudiation of American values, history, and culture. He claimed migrants are violent people when statistics show that undocumented immigrants commit less violent crimes than the general population. He claimed a wall would stop drug trafficking across the border when government statistics show that most drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry. He claimed migrants are driven here solely in the hope of economic gain when most are fleeing violence, drug cartels, and hunger. Last night, President Trump lied to the American people from the Oval Office. I stand with the 97% of Americans who support background check laws. Congress must act to save lives and pass #HR8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. #NeverAgain @realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr must understand the burden being placed on TSA workers and federal employees here in NJ &amp; across the country. Earlier today, I stood with @senatormenendez, @SenBooker, &amp; @RepDonaldPayne at the @EWRairport to demand an end to the partial gov’t shutdown. https://t.co/vo73jVWc8a This #CervicalHealthAwarenessMonth learn more about prevention, cervical health and HPV: https://t.co/utIHtwRaer Did you know HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer? Cervical cancer affects roughly 13,000 women in the United States, yet it is preventable through vaccination and regular screenings. Robust, independent investigations into government corruption must be carried out. Any alternative is unacceptable. Today’s #CICIG announcement is another blow to the protection of #democracy and #humanrights in #Guatemala. President Morales’ contempt for the institution is a roadblock to peace, prosperity, and security for the Guatemalan people. Last night, I voted to end the government shutdown and I call on my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.  Read my full statement: https://t.co/2XC79jg5FA https://t.co/V0XOuphpyq On my way to the House floor to vote on legislation that would end the government shutdown.

Now @USDOT has announced that NJTransit will receive over $6.5 million to continue PTC implementation. My statement: https://t.co/XDwd7cjc4J My statement: https://t.co/FhD0V63Yy9 https://t.co/9FfgIlRfBd Absolutely an embarrassment for the U.S. to undermine our allies the Kurds. Again. President Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of Syria is nothing short of a gift for the Iranian, Russian, and Syrian regimes to have free reign over the region. More information on the @pressfreedom report can be found here: https://t.co/DVn0GnKT4W Through the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I hope to work strategically with our international partners on this issue. 4 journalists were murdered in #Mexico alone this year &amp; just last week, the #Nicaraguan gov’t raided press offices that are critical of the #Ortega regime. Global #pressfreedom is tragically in crisis and, absent significant leadership, will only grow worse. Congress must fight to protect journalists and press institutions at home and abroad – a society committed to justice requires a free press. The brutal murder of #JamalKhashoggi is sadly part of a disturbing international trend. A new report from @pressfreedom shows that the number of journalists killed for their work nearly doubled in 2018 compared to the previous year. I joined @GovMurphy to congratulate @NJTRANSIT on a milestone in installing positive train control, a critical rail safety technology. I will keep working in Congress to give them the tools they need to keep commuters safe. https://t.co/N9G1lTTgag #Guatemala deserves a free, transparent government – not a tool to enrich the powerful If President #Morales thinks he can hoodwink the international community &amp; impede justice, he should know the world is watching. We are monitoring the visa revocation of 11 #CICIG staff members who were working on some of the most important anti-corruption cases in the country. The ACA continues to remain in effect while challenges make their way through the courts. Maintaining the health care of millions is one of my top priorities, and I will continue fighting to preserve access to care through legislative solutions with my colleagues.

On this 30th #WorldAIDSDay I encourage you to get out there and #knowyourstatus as we work to #EndAIDS. President George H.W. Bush was a true patriot who worked earnestly for the American people. Regardless of politics, he will be remembered as a model for leadership, compassion, and public service. While the country mourns his passing, his legacy will live on far into the future. This will be disruptive to NJ's economy and I will continue to strongly oppose these efforts. New Jersey does not want oil drilling off its coast. The Administration has ignored this bipartisan opposition and has approved five requests to begin dangerous oil &amp; natural gas exploration off our coasts. https://t.co/DIHxUYsoOE RT @RepSires: Open enrollment for 2019 is only six weeks! From now until Dec. 15th you can visit https://t.co/SXNhXJlGni to #GetCovered. ht… It’s official, @NASAInSight has landed!

November is also #MilitaryFamilyApreciationMonth, a time to thank the loved ones of our troops for the sacrifices they make and support you give to those who serve. Read my statement on the Speaker of the House for the 116th Congress: https://t.co/xEQ70ghQ4v Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of U.S. democracy. The Trump Administration’s decision to suspend the press credentials of CNN’s @Acosta for asking critical questions is unacceptable. Matthew Whitaker is not fit to oversee the Mueller investigation. Read my statement here: https://t.co/HOMoilSHmn Congress cannot keep ignoring the epidemic facing our nation, I urge the GOP Leadership to use the last weeks of the 115th Congress to pass urgently needed, common sense gun control measures. Last night, in Thousand Oaks, CA, 12 people lost their lives in a senseless tragedy.  Once again, bright futures have been snuffed out and communities have been torn apart by gun violence.  My heart breaks for the victims and those who lost a loved one. Following yesterday’s midterm elections, my statement on looking ahead to the 116th Congress: https://t.co/NxKYRgRYuT November is #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth. Throughout this month we honor the culture, tradition, and history, of native people. Open enrollment for 2019 is only six weeks! From now until Dec. 15th you can visit https://t.co/SXNhXJlGni to #GetCovered. https://t.co/GWVgSIlavl Thank you, @PANYNJ for inviting me today at the PATH Harrison Station to celebrate the opening of the NE Head House, the 1st milestone in a complete renovation. This revamp will greatly improve the travel of millions of riders who use the facility daily. #KeepTheRegionMoving https://t.co/bhKyPFjO5Q I would also like to thank the first responders who put their lives on the line while they worked to protect others The hatred shown today is un-American and I will do everything in my power as a Member of Congress to ensure that we continue to pass legislation that seek to prevent these violent acts. Today’s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA is a devastating tragedy for the community and our country as a whole. This hate crime has torn families apart and I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to those who lost loved ones. The patriotism and courage of our public servants prevented a heinous tragedy from unfolding this week. Thank you to the all the law enforcement agencies that worked together on stopping these explosive devices sent to political figures. My statement: https://t.co/nxIxAAJCb0 The interception of explosive packages by the U.S. Postal Service prevented what could have been a large scale tragedy for our nation. Thank you to the brave men and women of the USPS who face these risks every day as a part of their work.
