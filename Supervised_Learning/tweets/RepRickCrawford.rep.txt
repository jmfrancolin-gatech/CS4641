These experts who get these calls have a multitude of tools and resources now to assess the scene/device, more so than when I would join local law enforcement many years ago. We would have to get "eyes" on it directly to proceed We had to do all we could to ensure the least amount of harm possible to civilians and our unit as we assessed the device and what needed to be done. Initial Success, or Total Failure When I got called for different circumstances/situations, we had to determine what kind of device we were dealing with, its potential for harm, and how to secure the area around the device/munition There is no consideration for any other factor when they get the call about a device other than to determine what they are dealing with and what the immediate next steps should be to prevent harm/injuries The slogan we operated by in my unit was ‚ÄúInitial Success or Total Failure‚Äù and that is exactly what these individuals think of when they get the call of an IED/or explosive device Quite literally ‚Äì they are trained to handle a bomb of ANY kind and what to do with that device in the circumstances that they find it in and determine what to do accordingly All of these men and women who are a part of the bomb squads/bomb disposal units who get these calls are some of the best trained and are experts in how to handle a bomb of any kind, in any situation As a former bomb disposal technician, I wanted to share some personal insight about what goes on in situations like we have seen the last few days based on my own previous experience (Thread) RT @FoxNews: .@RepRickCrawford: "While it may be a device that could function, I think it was designed more than anything, to strike fear i‚Ä¶ In this post 9-11 era our bomb techs are much more advanced and really able to decipher evidence and who the perpetrator is -live on @IngrahamAngle These bombs were designed to be caught and incite fear in their intended victims -Live on @IngrahamAngle #Bombings I will be on @IngrahamAngle tonight at 9 pm (CT) talking about the explosive devices being discovered across the nation. Be sure to tune in to hear my thoughts and perspective as a former Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist. I expect that our law enforcement will conduct a rigorous investigation into these explosive devices and I am confident that they will find the perpetrator. I have the utmost respect for our 21st century bomb techs on all levels, they are well trained &amp; have advanced technology. @realjimrussell @toddstarnes It exacerbates the problem by creating a potentially poisonous powder to go airborne rather than it being contained in an envelope. This afternoon I spoke with @toddstarnes about the advanced training and technology that our nation's bomb techs have access to. Here are a few photos of some of the gear we might see them use to respond to the bombs we've been hearing about in today's news. #Bombings https://t.co/keOZSTNXhA This type of act is condemnable and it not consistent with our values as Americans. We now need to look to our law enforcement community to investigate motives and I know that they will do so very thoroughly. #Bombings -Live on @toddstarnes Based on the pictures I've seen, it looks like a very elementary basic pipe bomb. However, it looks like it was accompanied by an envelope of white powder which would've really caused even more of a problem had the bomb detonated. - Live on @toddstarnes The evidence is going to be speculated and that's human nature. But even if it's a hoax you don't ever leave anything to chance and you have to assume that it's a live device -Live on @toddstarnes #Bombings I‚Äôll be joining @toddstarnes in a few minutes to talk about the explosive devices being found across the country. These acts of terrorism are despicable and we will find who sent them and bring them to justice. Unfortunately @GeraldoRivera, there is evidence that the tunnels into US built by cartels are protected by IEDs that are amazingly consistent with IEDs found in theater. Wonder where they learned those techniques. ü§î https://t.co/Ybfwvi7I6z This Friday I had the honor of speaking at the Exchange Club of Jonesboro's Law Enforcement Banquet.

The worst part is that this doesn't just affect independent pharmacies, it affects folks in rural America that depend on their local pharmacists for customized healthcare. In districts like ours independent pharmacies are less far and in-between than CVS.
