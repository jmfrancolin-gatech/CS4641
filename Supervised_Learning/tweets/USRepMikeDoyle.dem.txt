This gives President Trump and Republicans another option for reopening the government while we negotiate over border security. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/VM8RDqahai #TrumpShutdown isn‚Äôt a minor inconvenience for federal workers like prison guards; it could cost them their jobs, which require periodic background checks. Bad credit records for late bills or missing mortgage payments could force them out.
https://t.co/WbsE5DeknM 25 days into the #TrumpShutdown, many people in #PGH are wondering how they will make ends meet on housing and groceries. @HouseDemocrats have voted many times to re-open the government and it is time to #EndTheShutdown.

One step closer to #EndTheShutdown! https://t.co/pNZfV5Xiy2 Federal employees are missing a paycheck today - 11,471 federal workers in PA are in agencies impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. It is completely unacceptable to prevent public servants from doing their jobs and earning a living. #EndTheShutdown and get them back to work! https://t.co/O4PXa9BZ5z The #TrumpShutdown is leaving our National Parks unprotected and understaffed. These national treasures should be preserved for all Americans to enjoy, not exposed to vandalism and overflowing waste. #EndTheShutdown
https://t.co/oMT7wTpCdT Throughout the #TrumpShutdown, the @EPA has been forced to halt inspections of drinking water systems, hazardous waste management, and chemical facilities. Keeping our water and air clean is essential - we must #EndTheShutdown.
https://t.co/P3bcS3h7QZ I voted to pass H.R. 267 to fund the Department of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. This bill would protect the safety of air and highway transportation and ensure that Americans living in public housing are not evicted in the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/bygdRV11I0 House Democrats passed H.R. 265 to fund the Department of Agriculture and the Food &amp; Drug Administration. This bill would get food safety inspectors back to work and it'd fund SNAP, eliminating uncertainty for families who rely on the food assistance it provides. #EndTheShutdown Joined the @PghCurrent this morning to talk about the #TrumpShutdown and my priorities for the 116th Congress ‚Äì including #NetNeutrality.

Read my statement: https://t.co/GA3tbk4QHb I‚Äôm pleased @GovernorTomWolf is moving to address #ClimateChange but we also need action from the federal government, in addition to states and municipalities. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm working in Congress to pass legislation to reduce #GreenhouseGasEmissions. https://t.co/aRpH7mizsR US greenhouse gas emissions increased dramatically last year - instead of showing leadership, the Trump administration has reversed course and abandoned Obama era efforts to reduce these harmful emissions https://t.co/ITfjsgUq1A It is past time to address the epidemic of gun violence with commonsense background checks - #HR8 is a simple bill to do just that and it could save many lives. #NeverAgain https://t.co/ft6a8qs8ae Due to the #TrumpShutdown, the Small Business Administration cannot operate its core lending and investment programs. This hurts small business and the consumers that rely on their products and services - and our economy! #EndTheShutdown I joined @RepAustinDavis, @SenatorCosta, @GovernorTomWolf, and @ACE_Fitzgerald today to discuss important local workforce development issues. Unemployment is low, but many Pittsburghers still need jobs, and local businesses are desperate for workers with certain skills. #LetsWork https://t.co/2SHxQFBonM @MattBenfordPA Representatives weren't technically allowed to make changes like that until we were officially sworn in yesterday afternoon as Members of the #116thCongress, but the number has since been updated. Thanks for the reminder! Today, I joined @HouseDemocrats in passing legislation to stop the #TrumpShutdown. It has been 12 days, and we have a responsibility to the American people to reopen the government. @POTUS should join us in getting to work on comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform! https://t.co/gf61AT7ioR Just sworn in as a member of the 116th Congress, and looking forward to a fresh start with a Democratic Majority in the House.

Law enforcement officers &amp; other govt employees working w/o pay - many others sent home w/no pay. Dems want effective border security but won't waste $ on his Wall. Today Congress approved S.512, which includes language I spearheaded in the House with @RepKinzinger. This bill will provide transparency and certainty for nuclear power plants, so that they can continue producing carbon free energy that is essential to curbing climate change.

For months, constituents have been delivering a message loud and clear: #NetNeutrality is not a partisan issue! I am sponsoring the discharge petition to restore #NetNeutrality rules and I will continue to fight for the free and open internet! 5 million with pre-existing conditions in #PA could lose health insurance if court approves @POTUS rollback of #ACA protections. This threatens Americans with health problems, women, and older adults - and denies healthcare to those who need it most! https://t.co/XLKf5f7wUP RT @RepHankJohnson: Yesterday, I joined my fellow Georgia legislators to support the governor's emergency declaration request after the lan‚Ä¶ Today‚Äôs 2.8% cost of living adjustment is great news! Social Security checks must keep up with the rising costs of healthcare and other expenses. As a member of the #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus, I am working to make the program stronger for both current and future generations. It is shameful that the Trump Administration is shutting down https://t.co/h0sWConSDQ every Sunday during open enrollment to prevent American families from signing up for affordable health care. This is clearly intended to sabotage health care markets! 
https://t.co/LHivJtaiPp There are only five days left to participate in this year‚Äôs Congressional App Challenge! Middle and high school students, register today and submit your entry by October 15. @CongressionalAC .@realDonaldTrump's visit to PA is reminder of the results of the #GOPagenda:
‚ÄîHealth costs are rising
‚ÄîPrescription drug prices are soaring
‚ÄîUnmet Infrastructure needs

Democrats are fighting #ForThePeople to address the challenges facing the families @HouseGOP has left behind. Congratulations to Pittsburgh native @francesarnold for being only the fifth woman in its 117-year history to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry! Your work has allowed for advances in biofuels and medicines that have helped to build a greener world. It‚Äôs disturbing that on this #childhealthday, the EPA has removed the director of its Office of Children's Health Protection ‚Äì a pediatrician and widely respected expert in the field. This is terrible #ForKidsHealth
https://t.co/cxVVNPE1nz Last night, #NetNeutrality became law in California! 
Today, the Trump Admin sued to roll it back! 
#NetNeutrality provides critical protections that promote innovation and competition. This Administration must end its attacks on consumers and innovators.
https://t.co/cKBeYxCJD4 Joined a huge majority to approve a bill to address the opioid epidemic (HR 6). It will expand access to opioid treatment programs and medication-assisted-treatment, expand Medicaid coverage for at-risk youth, and crack down on the importation of illegal drugs through the mail. Voted against #GOPTaxScam. It would increase the national debt by trillions of $$, provide most of its tax cuts to the rich (TWO-THIRDS of the cuts in this bill would go to households with incomes over $240,000), and create pressure to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. American Bar Association Says FBI Investigation Should Come Before A Kavanaugh Vote https://t.co/fRfxRSedsS I found Dr. Ford's testimony to be credible and courageous. The Senate should pause the confirmation proceedings until the FBI can investigate all of the recent allegations. The American people deserve to know the whole story before we put Judge Kavanaugh on the bench for life. Class act! https://t.co/p6HYVd1Ig7 More detailed information can be found here: https://t.co/fMczrCPQyV Joined an overwhelming bipartisan majority of my House colleagues to approve a federal spending bill that reflects my priorities for what our government should do. It includes a pay raise for troops and increased funding for NIH, opioid abuse prevention &amp; treatment, education. Pleased to see the House pass legislation that @RepKinzinger and I sponsored to provide certainty for a reliable source of clean energy! #NuclearMatters Are you registered to vote? It is #NationalVoterRegistrationDay. I encourage all Pittsburghers to make their voices heard! Exercise your rights and learn more at https://t.co/Wwv7BC88Rm. Reauthorizing #LWCF costs the American taxpayer nothing and protects public lands across the country. We must act quickly to #SaveLWCF this week! https://t.co/yK0liXDSXV Repealing #NetNeutrality rules makes it harder for small businesses to compete. Slower content and extra fees are bad news for innovators relying on the internet to reach customers. I signed the discharge petition to restore #NetNeutrality! Very pleased to receive a 100% rating from @CleanH2OPA for my recent votes on the environment. https://t.co/FomDNQwumS My staff is looking forward to meeting local #vets and providing assistance on Friday! If you cannot attend this event, please call my Penn Hills office at (412) 241-6055 for help with your #vets casework. https://t.co/IEJN9TfKcQ President Reagan‚Äôs son Michael made the conservative case for restoring #NetNeutrality recently in @Newsmax: consumers, innovators, and small businesses need #NetNeutrality to ‚Äòlevel the playing field‚Äô versus monopolistic Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
https://t.co/K61pkMWRoC The Land and Water Conservation Fund protects public lands and recreational access. If Congress fails to reauthorize it, this important program will expire on September 30. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 502 and I will continue to fight to #SaveLWCF. https://t.co/EgvNeIpFwC For the 20,000 women, men and children who call a domestic violence hotline each day, a phone is more than just a device ‚Äì it‚Äôs a lifeline to services, assistance, and help. #LifelineforSurvivors https://t.co/HeNkr1RlC9 https://t.co/HH1oi7Dsiz Social Security provides essential support for America‚Äôs seniors, survivors, and the disabled. I am an original member of the #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus to protect and strengthen these earned benefits. https://t.co/Q78UpF9Y1X Consumers are already seeing the consequences of repealing #NetNeutrality rules--fast lanes, slow lanes, and extra fees. We must preserve a level playing field online and restore #NetNeutrality immediately. Over 80% of Americans on both sides of the aisle agree on the importance of restoring #NetNeutrality rules. We must continue to call for a vote on the House Floor to preserve the free and open internet! Sorry to learn that Mike Pintek has passed away. Mike was on the air at KDKA Radio for more than 30 years, and I appreciated his in-your-face, no-holds-barred style. I want to extend my condolences to his family and friends.
https://t.co/dRPWXdvVnR Internet service providers are already slowing down service to @YouTube, @Netflix &amp; @PrimeVideo. We need to restore #NetNeutrality to make sure consumers have the protections they deserve.¬†https://t.co/V6Oy88gOSs It‚Äôs been 17 years, but like many Americans I can still remember clearly where I was. Every September 11, America must honor those who lost their lives that day, the families and communities who still grieve for loved ones, and the heroes who risked their lives to save others. https://t.co/CItKUG6KGg Despite constant attacks by the Trump Administration and the GOP Congress, the ACA has stabilized, with lower premiums and more insurers in many markets. #ACAisWorking

#MendItDontEndIt

https://t.co/60zdYoXLeE This morning, I had the honor of marching to celebrate the hard-working men and women of #PGH. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be back fighting in Congress for workers all across America. #LaborDay #ForThePeople Clearly motivated by race. This is another example of the Administration‚Äôs appalling disregard or human dignity and the law. @POTUS and @SecPompeo must stop this outrageous practice and make amends to the Americans who have been denied passports. 
https://t.co/bGGuoNnwJW August recess is ending ‚Äî all month Congress has been hearing from constituents, urging them to restore #NetNeutrality. Now's the time to get to work for small businesses, vets &amp; everyone who relies on an Open Internet. Has your Rep signed? https://t.co/N7VCNFtYBN Polls show a majority of voters view #NetNeutrality as a major issue. With recess ending &amp; Congress headed back to DC, it‚Äôs time for reps to stand w/ their constituents &amp; sign the CRA discharge to restore rules. Has your Rep signed? https://t.co/N7VCNFtYBN Outside Washington, #NetNeutrality. IS. NOT. A. PARTISAN ISSUE. Polling consistently shows the public *overwhelmingly* supports it on a bipartisan basis. With August recess over, it‚Äôs time for Congress to get to work to restore #NetNeutrality Very disappointed üëéin the court's decision to uphold the @FCC‚Äôs competitive market test for Broadband Data Services. It‚Äôs ridiculous to say a market is competitive if there‚Äôs only 1 provider. This decision hurts small businesses, schools, and libraries. https://t.co/o26aLoBSov Good editorial. Lifeline helps low-income Americans to get connected with basic phone and internet access, but recent actions by @FCC have threatened this program and the millions of families, veterans, and seniors who rely on it nationwide. #SaveLifeline
https://t.co/DvhXmCTnCE Saddened at the passing of Senator McCain. His life was characterized by courage and a commitment to serving this country, first in the military and then in Congress.  My prayers go out to his family. About 177 million Americans live, work, and attend school near a chemical facility. We need standards to reduce the risks of hazardous materials, and plans to keep communities safe just in case. I joined my colleagues to oppose rollbacks of these safety protections. https://t.co/457yoz2PId The internet can help first responders address emergencies and save lives. Without #NetNeutrality, ISPs can slow their internet access and charge them extra fees. This delays first responders and hurts communities‚Äîand it‚Äôs wrong.
https://t.co/YUOzZ1fmgC Video calls mean a great deal to servicememembers and their families. Without #NetNeutrality, ISPs can throttle or charge extra fees for streaming services. I am fighting to restore #NetNeutrality for these families. Today, veterans use the internet to find jobs, get an education to build skills for the future, and open small businesses. These men and women are patriots--and they deserve the opportunities that a free and open internet provides. We must restore #NetNeutrality now. Restoring #NetNeutrality rules would honor the veterans who have served our country and who rely on the free and open internet to access telehealth, learn about veterans benefits, and build communities. I will continue to advocate for clean air protections and investment in job-creating clean energy research and technology - and I will oppose efforts to undermine public health and job creation. https://t.co/r0CLvlMGVP Rolling back the Clean Power Plan undermines our nationwide effort to reduce air pollution &amp; protect public health while creating jobs &amp; growing the economy. @POTUS wants to allow more greenhouse gases &amp; deadly chemicals into the air, leading to 3600 more premature deaths a year. RT @RepDelBene: If you pass a law (#GOPTaxScam for the rich) that drives up the deficit, don‚Äôt insult America‚Äôs intelligence by claiming th‚Ä¶ Thank you, Peace, Love, and Zen, @smallseedsdev, @BeautyShoppeUSA, and @KSTheater for telling me how your businesses use the internet. I will continue to support #NetNeutrality for small businesses and organizations in #PGH! #CrawlEastLiberty @KSTheater is a dynamic theater in #PGH which uses the internet to advertise events and build audiences. I met with Janera Solomon, the Executive Director, and saw how much #NetNeutrality can help businesses to grow community. #CrawlEastLiberty https://t.co/lKLufHcPbn Last week, I met with Brittany Tonet of @smallseedsdev, a non-profit that provides social services and educational support in #PGH. #NetNeutrality helps this organization to connect with Pittsburgh families. #CrawlEastLiberty https://t.co/3eLqCeZ6bu
