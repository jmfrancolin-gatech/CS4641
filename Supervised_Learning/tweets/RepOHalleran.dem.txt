Programs like VACTE are crucial, and it is important that we continue to advocate for increased technical job skill training in #AZ01. https://t.co/Wx9eq256F1 The US Forest Service is one of many agencies w/ furloughed federal employees in #AZ01. Without their hard work, issues like these will continue to hobble progress in AZ. It is vital that we come together on a bipartisan basis to end this harmful shutdown. https://t.co/UMDwRBGSrT #AZ01 folks visiting Washington D.C. this spring can visit my website to schedule tours of the White House, the Capitol building, and other sites in the city: https://t.co/pfduGIXFHN I cosponsored @RepSchrader's Hold Congress Accountable Act to reduce salaries for Members of Congress during a shutdown. If elected officials don't do their jobs, they shouldn't be paid. I am forgoing my pay until the current shutdown ends. #AZ01 https://t.co/sxDhPKvJmy Folks impacted by this reckless shutdown are not just government bureaucrats in Washington, DC, they are hardworking support staff, corrections officers, and park service employees across the country. #ShutdownStories #AZ01 https://t.co/v7y6tfFvXa If our government officials cannot do their basic job of keeping the government open, they should not be getting paid, and they definitely should not be receiving pay raises. #AZ01 This is wrong. 

While janitors, TSA &amp; border patrol agents, and hundreds of thousands of other Americans (many in #AZ01) are working through this government shutdown without a paycheck, political appointees in the Administration are getting a $10K raise tomorrow. https://t.co/4MjWSQM59P We have a responsibility to rein in wasteful spending and get our federal debt under control, and PAYGO is a smart solution. We should not be saddling our children and grandchildren with this burden for generations to come.

Read my statement: https://t.co/pPOEzSoK2V There's a bipartisan plan on the table that funds our government &amp; provides greater security resources at the border, but unfortunately, President Trump wants to stand in the way of this work.

My thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones. President Bush exemplified true public service, opting to do what he believed was right for the nation over what was politically expedient. This has always been the hallmark of our government, and he and First Lady Barbara Bush practiced it every day. Today, I join the nation in mourning the passing of President George H. W. Bush and honor the long legacy of his service. We have lost a true patriot who put his country first both on the battlefield during World War II and as a public servant.
