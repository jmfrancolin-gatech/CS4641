This is a disgrace. https://t.co/hFJ10Egw5p Last night, I met with TSA workers at #MHT. They were supposed to get paid yesterday, but instead, they're working hard to keep passengers safe without a paycheck. They don't deserve this shutdown, and they deserve a functional govt. https://t.co/1zk84oyDpP If @senatemajldr doesn't take up a bill to re-open the govt tonight, Americans will be waking up tomorrow in the midst of the longest shutdown in our country's history.

We owe it to our federal employees to #EndTheShutdown. 4/6 https://t.co/n3Rc4SReZ6 Our federal employees have families to feed and bills to pay, and they're eager to get to work on our behalf.

The current govt shutdown is imperiling critical food aid for millions of families in need, it's making roads &amp; air travel less safe, and it's slowing down loans for homebuyers.

In the House we will continue to pass legislation to re-open federal agencies but need the Senate leadership take up these bills, funding levels they already passed in December.

We need to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/I9XqP64wB4 It's #Day19 of the govt shutdown. @POTUS presented no way forward last night, the Senate is refusing to even vote on the bills we passed to re-open the govt, &amp; federal workers are feeling the squeeze after nearly 3 weeks with no paycheck. This is not governing, it's chaos. https://t.co/8nvkxs9K45 READ: My response to President Trump's national address. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/sBl93iilgg Today would have been pay day for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Instead they're rushing to file for unemployment benefits or taking out loans to pay the bills. The effects of this shutdown are real &amp; far-reaching. They'll only get worse if we don't stop this madness. https://t.co/qD8TAYfuQP With just 12% of the IRS working, the Trump Admin. is making a promise it can't keep by saying Americans will get tax refunds on time. Our office has spoken to IRS employees who are worried about the impacts of the shutdown on their families &amp; are already feeling the squeeze. https://t.co/FH6qggN8zx Last night I met with @NATCANewEngland about how the govt shutdown is affecting them.

Let's end this senseless shutdown today. https://t.co/wX0h81qMIC More than 2,000 in NH are being personally impacted by the shutdown. These families are in the midst of financial crisis with no paycheck &amp; no end in sight. We voted to re-open the govt. We're waiting for the Senate to do its part to end this childish shutdown. #NH01 #nhpolitics https://t.co/4n5ZQkP2fX This is deeply alarming. We can't afford to ignore the signs of climate change. It's no coincidence that a coal-friendly EPA and a President that pulled out of the #ParisClimateAccord have facilitated the 2nd largest emissions spike in 20 years. https://t.co/xDkuKunJpx It's been 6 days since we passed legislation to open the government &amp; we're still waiting for the Senate to take action. Meanwhile, the shutdown's impacts are being felt by federal employees who haven't gotten a paycheck in nearly 3 weeks. https://t.co/iqTVOxCZMI Voters sent a clear message this fall: Washington isn't working for them &amp; we must change it. #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act would end the culture of corruption, fix our broken campaign finance system, make it easier to vote, &amp; give us a chance to make progress on key issues. https://t.co/aWFuTIugSa RT @rollcall: Rep.

We‚Äôre on day 17 of the #TrumpShutdown.

A government doesn't function when it doesn't pay its workers. We become less safe and less effective, and to what end? The Senate needs to take action today or so many dedicated federal employees won't get their next paycheck. A govt shutdown means food stamp recipients will receive $90 less this month. If it continues into March, food stamps disappear for a vulnerable population. Our social safety net can‚Äôt sustain this hit.

Senate leaders are abandoning their responsibility and sitting on their hands while 800K federal workers are a day away from their next paycheck being withheld. This is outrageous even by Washington standards. I‚Äôve been hearing from constituents who are looking at filing for unemployment to cover their most basic bills. This shutdown is hurting families in real ways &amp; its impacts will accelerate if nothing is done. Let‚Äôs end this embarrassing shutdown &amp; move on in a constructive way. The Senate already passed the legislation we sent them to re-open the govt. It's absurd that @senatemajldr is doing the Admin‚Äôs bidding by refusing to take a vote. That's not how our checks &amp; balances work. Thousands of NH families are suffering because of this political nonsense 2,055 federal employees in NH are unpaid because of this pointless, political shutdown. The pain for these families and adverse impacts on services will accelerate next week if nothing is done. That‚Äôs why I voted to open the govt Thursday &amp; why the Senate should follow suit. https://t.co/UDu8vtrxIT
