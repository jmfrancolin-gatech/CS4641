Did you know that Audubon, #Iowa is home to Albert the Bull? Enjoyed being back in Audubon County this morning for a town hall meeting. Thanks to everyone who joined for the thoughtful questions! #99CountyTour https://t.co/DxHJu1UjRW S/o to @RepArrington, @RepCindyAxne, @RepFinkenauer &amp; others for introducing similar leg to my No Budget, No Recess Act, which keeps Congress in DC until budget &amp; approps process is complete. If this doesn't happen, we should stay in town &amp; work together until we get the job done As we celebrate #NationalIowaDay, I'm reminded of what an honor it is to represent the best people and the greatest state in the nation. #Iowans, what are you doing to celebrate? üåΩüêñü•öüë®‚Äçüåæ https://t.co/cvvCUOXo6z William Barr is extremely qualified to be atty general. We‚Äôve passed bipartisan opioid leg &amp; reformed our criminal justice system, but we need an AG in place to best implement these policies. Yesterday, I voted him out of @senjudiciary, now it's time for #Senate to confirm him. https://t.co/yGxACIW0eU We are past that date, so today I sent a letter requesting the report immediately. Read my full letter here: https://t.co/eRS2TfsSfr Securing funding for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project was a top priority. My provision in the 2018 water infrastructure bill requires the Army Corps of Engineers to submit a progress report within 90 days of its signing. .@NWBC provides counsel to Congress &amp; the admin on economic challenges affecting women biz owners. I'm happy to report my nominee, Barb Kniff-McCulla of Pella, IA, is officially a member! She‚Äôll bring a unique perspective on issues facing women biz owners in rural communities. When bad actors abuse our trade policies, the President should have the tools available to hold them accountable. However, the @DeptofDefense, not @CommerceGov, should evaluate the nat'l security basis for tariffs. My legislation reforms that process: https://t.co/gtFUb7z4uf I‚Äôm proud of our achievements, and I‚Äôm glad for the leadership of @POTUS and folks willing to work together to get our economy moving. There is more work yet to be done, and I look forward to seeing our economy continue to achieve new heights. Simply put, when Washington gives power back to Main Street, American families win. Furthermore, cutting red tape and scaling back burdensome regulations has led to a surge in small business optimism. For example, a business in Dyersville, Iowa invested 75% of their tax savings last year into their employees, giving $800 bonuses to their 162 full time workers. One of their employees said she planned to put her bonus into her retirement fund, an investment in her future. The #TaxCutsandJobsAct has allowed Iowa‚Äôs job creators to invest in their workers and grow their businesses. Nowhere is the power of this job creation more evident than #Iowa, where the 2.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in the nation. There are 64,000 plus jobs open in Iowa right now! Over 1.6 million Iowans are employed ‚Äì the most in our state‚Äôs history. The tight labor market has drawn workers off of the sidelines. Folks that have been unemployed or underemployed are finding work. Just as important, this economic growth has put upward pressure on wages, with the average hourly pay increasing by 3.2 percent from last year. Lower-wage workers saw some of the biggest increases. Last Friday‚Äôs January jobs report is a continued good news story, with 304,000 new jobs added last month.  It is also an example of how Republican pro-growth policies are getting people back to work. I rise today to speak on the strength of the U.S. economy. As President Trump said in last night‚Äôs #SOTU, ‚Äúour economy is thriving like never before.‚Äù I'm headed to the #Senate floor to speak on the success of our pro-growth policies and the strength of the economy. Tune in! https://t.co/aJpprKiUxL #ICYMI ‚Å¶@Messenger_News‚Å©: Joni Ernst has the right idea https://t.co/0OVhPVvDZ1 Tonight, we heard a message of unity, prosperity and cooperation from @POTUS. He called on us to come together for the greater good to find solutions and continue to grow our economy. I‚Äôm hopeful we can build on the bipartisan successes of last Congress. #SOTU https://t.co/0XLlK5abWS RT @SenateGOP: "On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected.  An eco‚Ä¶ Many #Iowans enjoy hunting &amp; target shooting, hobbies passed on from one generation to the next. Today, @EPWGOP advanced the Target Practice &amp; Marksmanship Training Support Act, a bill I cosponsored that'll make it easier for states to construct &amp; maintain public shooting ranges. .@POTUS was clear in his commitment of year-round E15 by the summer driving season. Today, I supported @EPAAWheeler's nomination to lead the @EPA with the expectation he upholds the administration's promise. I will continue to work with him to ensure this is met. In the world's greatest deliberative body, the United States Senate, it is unfathomable that a bill that simply prohibits infanticide was blocked on the floor.

Last week, we witnessed the ugly truth about the far-reaching grasp of the abortion industry &amp; its radicalized agenda. This assault on life cannot stand. I'm headed to the floor to speak on @SenSasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Tune in: https://t.co/ISWjmeDThY I am encouraged by my conversation with @SecWilkie this week on helping our vets who are at risk. I‚Äôm grateful he is addressing those concerns and he‚Äôs made suicide prevention his top priority.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been in close contact w/ the VA on this very issue. (1/2) January's jobs report is yet another example of Republican pro-growth policies at work. Exceeding expectations, 304,000 new jobs were added to the economy &amp; wages continue to rise. Our policies are creating more opportunity for #Iowans &amp; all Americans: https://t.co/fVnNDbYUxg Crimes committed by those here illegally, like the tragic death of Sarah Root, are among the most heartbreaking, senseless and preventable. Although nothing can bring Sarah back, we can ensure that no person falls victim to this injustice again by codifying my bill, Sarah‚Äôs Law. https://t.co/VGxQaQgGbt One of my favorite traditions I‚Äôve held since my first year in the Senate is doing a ruck march in Washington, D.C. with fellow veterans and members of my staff.

Since historic #TaxReform, Iowa has added 15,500 jobs &amp; unemployment has fallen to 2.4%, the lowest in the nation. https://t.co/RhHbww9fZ4 These bills are horrific and not who we are as Americans. There is no excuse to kill a baby ‚Äì but the idea that Democrats are actually calling for the legalization of infanticide is a call to action. This isn‚Äôt just extreme, it‚Äôs barbaric and inhumane. RT @KCRG: Iowa Republican Senators Joni Ernst and Charles Grassley pressed the U.S. Department of Education to investigate if more oversigh‚Ä¶ Sarah‚Äôs Law brings us closer to restoring justice in our broken immigration system by allowing law enforcement to detain &amp; hold criminals accountable. We have an obligation to the Root family to ensure that no citizen falls victim to this injustice again. https://t.co/4wBUIlJujb I‚Äôm headed to the Senate floor at noon to reintroduce my bill, Sarah‚Äôs Law‚Äîlegislation in honor of Sarah Root, a young Iowa woman who was tragically killed at the hands of an illegal immigrant.

The 2018 Farm Bill was a must-do and a big-win for Iowa. The 2018 Farm Bill will strengthen conservation programs, provide critical mental health support to the agriculture community, support our nation‚Äôs dairy farmers and maintain a robust crop insurance program. It‚Äôs unacceptable when the VA fails in delivering for our vets. With my support, the Senate acted to ensure the VA fully reimburses our vets for any missed or underpaid #ForeverGIBill housing benefits they are owed. We owe our vets the support they were promised.

Tune in to watch my discussion with @SenatorShaheen and @heatherscope: https://t.co/uREEk9XRhb #ICYMI ‚Å¶@gazettedotcom: As government shutdown looms, Sen. Joni Ernst not backing down on 'Make 'em Squeal' campaign  https://t.co/XBYSzRRhxr Tonight, I signed the #FarmBill Conference Report. We‚Äôve seen tremendous leadership by @SenPatRoberts &amp; @senatemajldr throughout this process. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that will bring certainty to our farmers &amp; ranchers in #Iowa &amp; across America. https://t.co/63B8SrNv2M As a proud Iowan &amp; co-chair of the 57th Annual U.S. Senate Youth Program Senate Advisory Committee, I want to congratulate 2 outstanding students who have been selected to represent the great state of Iowa: Kevin Drahos of Linn-Mar High School &amp; James Meng of Valley High School. Wow! What an awesome day! I loved spending it with my daughter, the #USMA Corps of Cadets and @RepTrentKelly! #GoArmyBeatNavy #ArmyNavyGame https://t.co/dj05TRzrTJ There‚Äôs economic optimism across the country! Unemployment is at its lowest since 1969, and the economy added 155K new jobs &amp; grew at 3.5% in Q3 this year. Here in the Senate, we're making real reforms that help grow small businesses and create jobs in #Iowa &amp; the entire U.S. https://t.co/3jz0EggFvB Go Army! Today we remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice and the countless others who were wounded and impacted by the attack at Pearl Harbor. https://t.co/Gvmno2So2r #ICYMI Sen. Joni Ernst shows leadership https://t.co/Hdd4HmzCxv Getting China to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance and limit production will help us combat the crippling opioid crisis in the U.S. It is a meaningful accomplishment in our fight against a drug that caused over 200 opioid-related deaths in Iowa in 2016 alone. No! Congress has doled out countless ‚Äúnonsensical‚Äù earmarks. These pet projects waste Americans hard-earned tax dollars ‚Äì not to mention they are reckless, wasteful and SWAMPY! https://t.co/sBBy0mrCtk Wishing all those who celebrate a very happy Hanukkah! https://t.co/tBylNAmDdZ RT @SenateGOP: Happening Now: Former President @GeorgeHWBush arrival ceremony at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.
https://t.co/wbwMOpqqyP I joined @TeamCavuto over the weekend to discuss the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush. You can watch the full interview here: https://t.co/DKwhR0rZWX (2/2) This legislation will ensure that for years to come, the U.S. will continue to take a leading role in the fight against this horrendous epidemic. I urge President Trump to swiftly sign this legislation into law. https://t.co/SkX4c7BQ1h (1/2) This week, the Senate passed legislation that I cosponsored that will extend the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). For over a decade, PEPFAR has provided access to lifesaving treatment to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. At the start of the hour, I will be speaking on a panel @ReaganDefense Forum on the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East. You can watch live here: https://t.co/bXEMkhFFBm George H.W. Bush was committed to furthering the ideals that this country was built upon, in a way that will transcend his life. Read my full statement on the passing of George H.W. Bush:  https://t.co/uYuZKMMvZd (2/2) After meeting with @EPAAWheeler on Wed, I‚Äôm hopeful that we‚Äôre done with former Administrator Pruitt‚Äôs mishandling of the RFS and waiver process. Now that this rule is finalized, the @EPA needs to move forward in fulfilling President Trump‚Äôs promise of E-15 year-round. (1/2) The release of the final RVOs for 2019 provides farmers and ethanol producers much needed transparency and certainty.  However, it is disappointing that the gallons lost through the unprecedented handing out of small refinery waivers was not addressed. .@POTUS has fulfilled another of his promises in renegotiating our trade relationship w/Canada &amp; Mexico‚Äî2 of Iowa‚Äôs major trade partners. USMCA is a good step for #Iowa farmers &amp; manufacturers, &amp; I look forward to working w/my colleagues as we consider this important agreement. #ICYMI ‚Å¶@RadioIowa‚Å©: Ernst optimistic Farm Bill reaches president in December https://t.co/Eh3BO1Se3R .@realDonaldTrump is right to cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Argentina.  Russia‚Äôs actions in the Kerch Strait this weekend were unjustified, and it is in everyone‚Äôs best interest that the ships and crew are returned to Ukraine as soon as possible. Passing a Farm Bill will provide our farmers with the tools and certainty they need to navigate this stretch of turbulent income, prices and trade access.  While an agreement in principle has been reached, I am working hard to ensure the Farm Bill is a win for Iowa‚Äôs farmers. https://t.co/wr07WSY63L Once again, here we are, with no real fix to a broken budget process. I am very disappointed in my Democratic colleagues who chose to preserve their vacations and the dysfunctional status quo instead of working together to fund the government responsibly. https://t.co/zKFeLetD7S I joined Senator Jon Kyl and 23 of my other colleagues in urging President Trump to consider the key factors that underpin the continued viability of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. To read our letter to the president, click here: https://t.co/gVKwbmLIsL The President of the Republic of Kosovo, H.E. Mr. Hashim Thaci, and I met today to discuss our shared goal of peace and prosperity for the people of Kosovo. https://t.co/agfyGjvZlK Throughout the year, but especially around the holidays, it‚Äôs important we remember those who are serving or have served in uniform. Today, I joined many of my colleagues in signing holiday cards for our military personnel, their families &amp; our veterans. Thank you for all you do! https://t.co/f2Y3zH9IN4 From one Iowa guardsman to another, what a special honor to present Sgt. Major Bob Reedy of Humboldt, Iowa with a Quilt of Valor. Thank you for serving and protecting our nation and state. https://t.co/IYiLWCSPnG It was a great night for a ruck march. Thanks to everyone for coming out! https://t.co/9B3t7cw6tB I join co-chairs of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, @senrobportman &amp; @SenatorDurbin, our caucus colleagues &amp; Sen Foreign Relations Committee member @SenatorRisch in condemning Russia‚Äôs capture of Ukrainian ships and injuring and detention of Ukrainian sailors. https://t.co/zwY8NBvZCb https://t.co/R4P9iKoqWx (2/2) Congress can do better; we owe it to the American people to complete our work on time. If we fail to meet our deadlines, we should stay at work until we get the job done. #MakeEmSqueal 

https://t.co/1lH0Cb733y (1/2) The most essential role Congress has is to raise revenue and fund the federal government. Yet, since 1974, Congress has passed all of its appropriations bills just four times. And, in the past 20 years, we have only passed a budget resolution 11 times! RT @SenateGOP: Thanks to Republicans‚Äô pro-growth agenda, the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.7%. https://t.co/lVFa0sw6MJ With the bipartisan Department of Energy Veterans‚Äô Health Initiative Act, we will see greater collaboration between ‚Å¶@ENERGY‚Å© and ‚Å¶@DeptVetAffairs‚Å© to solve complex data challenges and advance veterans‚Äô health care.

As a member of @SmallBizCmte, I'll continue to champion commonsense policies that are good for our #smallbiz community. Don't forget to get out &amp; #ShopSmall today! https://t.co/j1caq9SZUC Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/dDHDttXsYy (3/3) I look forward to working with the President, our intelligence agencies, as well as my colleagues in the Senate to ensure we have all the facts moving forward. (2/3) At the same time, as a nation committed to human rights and the rule of law, we must hold accountable all who are responsible for this crime and insist on transparency from our friends and partners. (1/3) While Saudi Arabia is an important partner in the Middle East, it is clear that the Kingdom has been less than forthright about the details surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi on October 2. We remain committed to preserving American interests in the Middle East. Did you know that Council Bluffs, Iowa is home to Google‚Äôs largest data center? Today‚Äôs tour gave me good perspective on some challenges they‚Äôre facing in #Iowa and work we can be doing to help with family leave, workforce development and community involvement. https://t.co/vT4o3GKAPa Out of DC &amp; back home in #Iowa for a business town hall at Principal Financial, a company that employs 7000 Iowans. Discussions like these help me do my job by hearing firsthand how policies &amp; legislation--like trade &amp; the #farmbill-- impacts the lives of Iowans across the state. https://t.co/Y7BTJ5YZU7 Small businesses are key to Iowa's booming economy, making up 99% of all businesses across the state. I'm honored to receive this year's Guardian of Small Business Award, and will continue to be a champion for our small biz community.

Ernst Joins ‚Å¶@ChuckGrassley‚Å© and @SenatorDurbin on Bipartisan Push for Sentencing Reform: We need to address the disturbingly high rate of women ‚Äì especially mothers ‚Äì in prison and ensure our criminal justice system is addressing their unique needs. https://t.co/xiYKg0CjRd Go Navy, Beat Tulsa! https://t.co/dZEpdG4ZQf It was an honor delivering the principal address at the commissioning of USS Sioux City. It gives me great pride that Iowa‚Äôs 4th largest city has been chosen as the namesake for the newest addition to a class of fast and versatile warships defending our seas. https://t.co/W31wiiNhw8 3/3 Iowans know that you don‚Äôt take a vacation until the job is done. That‚Äôs why I introduced the No Budget, No Vacation Act, which would prevent Congress from going on recess if we don‚Äôt pass a budget &amp; fund the gov‚Äôt on time. I will bring this up for a vote when we reconvene. 2/3 The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Reform, on which I serve, is tasked with fixing this process so we finish our work on time. Ironically, halfway through our markup, the Committee decided to adjourn until just a few days before our statutory deadline. 1/3 Well said, @SenatorLankford. We are $21 trillion in debt. Since 1974, we have passed all of our spending bills only 4 times! And, in the past 20 years, we have only passed a budget 11 times. We need to fix our broken budget and approps process. https://t.co/rMO7Glbt60 I‚Äôve joined fellow #Iowa Sen. @ChuckGrassley &amp; my colleagues @SenatorDurbin, @SenMikeLee, @CoryBooker, @LindseyGrahamSC

Under her leadership, Iowa is working to create new opportunities for apprenticeships throughout the state, which will help develop a highly-trained and skilled workforce. (2/3) Apprenticeships are key to addressing the diverse needs of Iowa employers and creating a highly-skilled workforce. (1/3) Happy Friday! I‚Äôm up next on @FoxNews to talk women in leadership. Tune in to America‚Äôs Newsroom! https://t.co/j9uI0mVJCz Young farmers across the US represent the future of agriculture &amp; enabling them to succeed means we all succeed. Today, I met w/some of those young farmers &amp; discussed the need for a #farmbill &amp; the FARMERS FIRST Act, which provides mental health support to the ag community. https://t.co/Hv3LGolCmT In #Iowa, and across the US, small businesses and rural communities need better access to quality broadband. Yesterday, I had a good discussion about the importance of rural broadband access with Andrew Randol of Panora Telco, an Iowa telecom provider in Guthrie County. https://t.co/1iEq5CUNYX RT @SenateGOP: The Senate has just passed the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 to help ensure our waters are safe and secure. https://‚Ä¶ I seek to serve as a strong voice in leadership, while bringing new ideas &amp; a fresh face to the team.Whether I am fighting for our servicemembers &amp; our country‚Äôs global interests, or finding solutions to rural America‚Äôs challenges‚ÄìI seek to make Iowans &amp; all Americans proud(2/2).
