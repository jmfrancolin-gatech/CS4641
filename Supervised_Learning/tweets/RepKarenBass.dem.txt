The future is bright. This is what working #ForThePeople looks like. https://t.co/Yg3F4E4m4r Today on National Adoption Day, we celebrate the families formed by adoption and also pledge to continue to embrace solutions to continue to find safe and loving homes for our nation’s youth. https://t.co/dh1SfWmOD8 I’ve worked in LA hospitals and have seen people die because of a lack of insurance. 

If you don’t have health insurance or want to change your @CoveredCA health plan, you have until January 15th to do so. 

RT to spread the word. Make sure you #GetCovered! En enero, un nuevo Congreso comenzará a trabajar. 

Ahora, ¿qué vamos a hacer?  

Acompáñenme este Domingo en una reunión pública para mantenerse informado. https://t.co/ZCcRrufrxU https://t.co/5BwopDlBxX Thank you to the first responders and local law enforcement working day and night to make sure these fires don’t spread any further. 

We are all grateful for your service. https://t.co/ott9xMfl6E As someone with family who has had to evacuate due to these fires, I understand the terror, I understand the helplessness, and I also understand the looming feeling of not knowing whether or not your house will still be standing when you return. https://t.co/XyJofRG4RM The Indian Child Welfare Act is the gold standard of treatment of native children in the child welfare system. 

Now it’s under attack. #DefendICWA

https://t.co/TsLnKYtFF1 I'm so proud to support legislation to give him the Congressional Gold Medal. 

I cannot think of one person in this country that is more deserving of this award. https://t.co/ydDFl5tnVw He was a mentor and a teacher to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and continues to guide myself and hundreds of other activists in Los Angeles and throughout the world. https://t.co/xmuSK5GBZk Reverend James Lawson is a national hero and an international icon for the fight for freedoms and liberties of oppressed peoples throughout the world. https://t.co/mX2fOpz9MZ Nancy Pelosi has my vote for Speaker. In January, a new Congress will be sworn in. Now what? 

Join me Sunday for a town hall to find out.

RSVP here: https://t.co/ZCcRrufrxU https://t.co/pcCjxYhSaU Working while Black shouldn’t be a death sentence in America. 

Now, a young child will never get to know their dad and a mother will have to bury her son.

https://t.co/Zue86uBWJR Today on #VeteransDay, we honor those who have served this country in uniform to defend our freedoms. 

To our veterans — thank you for your service. Wanted to thank everyone again for all you did in this past election. 

It’s an absolute honor to continue to represent the very same LA streets I grew up on in DC. 

When I fight #forthepeople, I fight for you. Relieved to hear that the students kidnapped in #Cameroon earlier this week have been released. 

I urge all sides to end the violence, stop targeting civilians, and to find a nonviolent solution to the  conflict.  

https://t.co/0k8taMhana A giant step towards comprehensive immigration reform and away from bigoted policy. 

We will work #forthepeople.

https://t.co/D7SPTE5PvK Jim Acosta asked a tough question of the President of the United States and he just had his credentials taken away for it. 

This is the result of years of the poisonous rhetoric towards the press and a dangerous escalation in the White House’s war against the truth. https://t.co/5xbmYbWuBv Every mass shooting happens in someone’s backyard. Last night, it was in ours. In a bar. On college night. 

Today, I grieve with the Thousand Oaks community. In January, we will swear in a Congress with the courage to do something about it. Trump didn’t like the news cycle reminding him that Democrats took back the House so he went out to create a new one. 

Typical form.

https://t.co/KivPrdePES Reports breaking right now say that the resignation letter written by Jeff Sessions was undated AND submitted at Trump's request.

Congress will be called to session in 6 days. The first order of business should be protecting Robert Mueller’s investigation. https://t.co/o6CfE47YR1 We now have a House of Representatives that will focus on lowering prescription drug costs. 

We now have a House of Representatives that will focus on investing in infrastructure. 

We now have a House of Representatives that will fight #forthepeople.
 
Watch us work. History in the next Congress:

The first time there will be 2 Latina Congresswomen from TX.
The first time there will be 1 African American Congresswoman from MA.
The first time there will be 2 Muslim Congresswomen.

This will be the first time there is a check on Trump. Even on #ElectionDay, we have to remember our international role.
 
79 children. Gone.

This is the most recent example of how Cameroonians, especially kids, are the ones who suffer most when governments are unwilling to put life first. We must work towards a nonviolent solution. https://t.co/rHADqrhYlP California polls are open until 8:00 pm tonight. Make sure you vote! https://t.co/digjolLnrt This was 10 years ago yesterday. 

What will they say in 10 years about what happens tomorrow?

VOTE. https://t.co/yvY9p2wWXQ A hero for civil liberties I will never forget how Ramona defended Los Angeles activists and fought for civil and human rights. 

Her impact will be felt for generations. Her fight lives on. 

https://t.co/ho7YNXsjfV Beautiful #diadelosmuertos celebration tonight in South LA! https://t.co/x0Gn3ln1hG Tonight, millions will #showupforshabbat. 

Hate will not divide us. 

Fear will not defeat us. 

I stand with you. Latinas earn about 53 cents for every dollar made by white men meaning they must work all the way into November 2018 to earn what these men took home in 2017 alone. 

We #DemandMore. Tonight I spoke at the Tree of Life Interfaith Prayer Service at @FAMECHURCH to call for solidarity in the wake of tragedy. https://t.co/kASRygcSxx When they go low, we go high. 

That doesn’t mean you go soft. 
That doesn’t mean you don’t fight. 

That just means you don’t have to be despicable and racist. https://t.co/Rthe05Ft1U If Trump is so concerned about birthright citizenship, why isn’t he also worried about his properties being used by wealthy Russians for no other purpose than to give birth to children who automatically become U.S. Citizens?
https://t.co/5QBBFphCsn As many as 10 million people in the individual market have pre-existing health conditions and may lose federal protections against discrimination due to the Trump administration’s legal actions against the Affordable Care Act. 

https://t.co/k4OODDSV5S Saddling our students with $1.5 trillion in debt is setting up our future generations to fail. 

Most of my staffers are still paying off their debt. The system is broken and Congress must step up and fix it #ForThePeople. 

https://t.co/igKtMYjk3p How many textbooks could we have bought? 

How much extra could we have put into opioid relief or hurricane recovery? 

These gimmicks to stoke fears and gin up the vote is going to get people killed. I wonder how much it cost to unnecessarily move thousands of troops to the border... all to “protect” us from the hundreds of women and children desperately seeking asylum. Proud to have voted against every single Republican attempt to take away pre-existing conditions from millions of Americans. 

Proud to vote #ForThePeople.
