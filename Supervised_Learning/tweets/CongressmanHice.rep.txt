Earlier this week, I was honored to join Ashley Clegg, a #GA10 student at @schsredskins, as she accepted an appointment to @WestPoint_USMA. Ashley has gone above and beyond to earn this, and I couldn't be more proud of her. I know we can only expect more great things to come! https://t.co/mwF39GKw2G Tonight’s telephone town hall will give those of you who want to ask me a question –or simply just follow the discussion– another opportunity to do so. I look forward to listening to #GA10 &amp; making sure they know where I stand on the issues. Sign up here: https://t.co/amblzAP7Mp. https://t.co/un8nCV5neR .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump: "America was founded on liberty and independence – not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country." #SOTU Every human life is precious and a gift from God. Late-term abortions and infanticide are egregious and horrific practices, and I applaud @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for demonstrating his commitment to protecting life. #ProLife #SOTU Once a wall was built in San Diego, illegal traffic dropped by 92%. In Tucson, traffic dropped 90%. In Yuma, illegal traffic dropped by 95% in less than a decade. We want to #BuildTheWall because #WallsWork. #SOTU Border security shouldn’t be controversial. Without a secure border, the safety and security of every American is at risk. Folks have long supported a physical barrier because #WallsWork. It’s time for Democrats to come to the table, end the gridlock, and #SecureOurBorders. #SOTU While Democrats cast blame and obstruct progress, President @realDonaldTrump stands for the victims of our porous borders, like the Angel Families of those killed by illegal immigrants.  #SOTU 4,000 violent killings by illegal aliens is not a "manufactured crisis." Neither are the 30,000 sex crimes and 100,000 assaults committed by criminal aliens over the past two years. We're in the middle of a border crisis, and it's time to take action. #BuildTheWall #SOTU As President @realDonaldTrump has said before, folks "don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside." .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump told our entire Nation the harsh truth: There's a crisis at our southern border, and there are real consequences of illegal immigration. It's our duty to defend our country from crime, drugs, and terrorism. #BuildTheWall #SOTU .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump : "Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong!" Thanks to the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct, historic #TaxReform is making all the difference for individuals, families, and small businesses. Every month, Americans now keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. #SOTU With weekly jobless claims at their lowest since 1969 and wages on the rise, opportunities are expanding for every American, and I share the optimism expressed by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump . When America is strong, unified, and proud, we can accomplish anything. #SOTU In just the past two years, more than 5 million jobs have been added to our economy. That’s 5 million more paychecks and 5 million people with new opportunities to secure their own future. #SOTU Watch President Donald J Trump deliver his second State of the Union address and outline his vision for America.

I want to know your opinion. Comment with your thoughts throughout the #SOTU address tonight. https://t.co/j7M5DxYQXE Last Friday was full of meetings in my Monroe District Office, and I enjoyed hearing from many people from around the community.
