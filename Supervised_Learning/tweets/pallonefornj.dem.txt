Frank was proud to join Governor Murphy as he signed into law a $15 minimum wage in New Jersey.
JOIN US as we continue to fight for equality and fairness for ALL New Jersey families. https://t.co/tfjfsxA32A Another senseless mass shooting, we don't have to live like this. Frank is a #GunSenseChampion, with a proven record of leading &amp; supporting gun reform legislation. He holds the safety of New Jersey residents &amp; their families in his heart &amp; top of mind. 
https://t.co/ITldyvTQBh We stand with Frank as he stands with furloughed federal workers while the detached and out of touch Trump administration is playing games with these patriotic public servants and their families.
We must END the #SenselessShutdown
https://t.co/Ao4B40MSiw GOP Senate Leader McConnell should remember that Congress is a co-equal branch of gov. House Dems are doing their job. Yet, McConnell takes direction from Trump on this #SenselessShutdown keeping gov workers held hostage for a phony wall. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/U1QgmFokBq Frank is holding those in high places accountable as another casualty of the #SenselessShutdown reveals itself.
https://t.co/gzyR0PkXGw Gun safety is a real threat to national security, NOT fabricated *crisis* @ southern border. Re-open the government ASAP so we can get 2 work &amp; face serious issues, like keeping families safe from gun violence. Frank is our #GunSenseChampion! @MomsDemand https://t.co/YDEdJai3TY Donald Trump has plans to allow oil drilling rigs off NJ beaches, Frank says NO WAY!
"This is all part of an anti-environmental agenda that could have catastrophic consequences for our environmental and economic health."
https://t.co/cI7RsNJqJV Tonight, President Trump will address the nation about his foolhardy insistence on keeping the government shut down, holding federal workers hostage, so he can please the far right with his border wall. Know the facts: https://t.co/wRd9jgxMWz What a special day having friends &amp; supporters from NJ &amp; around the country in DC as Frank took the gavel as Chairman of the Energy &amp; Commerce Cmte. There is much work to be done to hold the Administration accountable, address climate change, strengthen the ACA &amp; so much more. https://t.co/YdYM96MEC9 Buses filled with supporters headed to DC on this historic day to swear in a New Dem Majority &amp; celebrate Frank as Chairman of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee! It's the culmination of our hard work but just the start of putting our country back on track! #DemsTakeTheHouse https://t.co/IfwUoST7Gq You re-elected Frank to be a champion for working people, and that's reflected in his priorities in Congress:

✅Infrastructure investment
✅Protecting our health care
✅Combatting climate change
✅Lowering prescription drug costs

https://t.co/LaranDspna Trump has spent his entire presidency spreading fear &amp; demonizing immigrants, yet he personally benefits everyday from the hard work immigrants provide. Such hypocrisy.

@MikieSherrill @JoshuaWelle @Malinowski @AndyKimNJ @VanDrewForNJ https://t.co/j3i0eLEQQo The GOP have made cutting Medicare and Social Security a platform to pay for their tax cuts to corporations.

We need to send Senator Menendez back to the Senate to fight back against Trump and the GOP's continued assault on our natural resources. https://t.co/KKG4XDX8yO Great conversation last night with the Old Bridge Democrats. Frank spoke about the importance of sending he and @Bonnie4congress back to Congress. https://t.co/LEYa7IoR1z At a candidates forum today Frank's opponent had this to say about gun safety: Guns should be unregulated because "guns are designed to put holes in people that deserve to have holes in them."
