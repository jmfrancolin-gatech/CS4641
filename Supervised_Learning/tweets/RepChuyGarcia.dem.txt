He pensado mucho en Raquel Guerrero esta semana. Ella estuvo involucrada en todos los esfuerzos por hacer que Pilsen fuera una comunidad mejor. Ella alz√≥ su voz por los inmigrantes y las familias trabajadoras. Agradezco haberla tenido como ejemplo. https://t.co/56Im4oDk5P I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about Raquel Guerrero. She was involved in every effort to make Pilsen a better community. She was a fierce voice for immigrants and for working families. She was a strong woman and I am grateful to have had her as a role model. https://t.co/AUVOd8T5qo Noah was proud to show his art book, which featured a Catrina face on the cover. His after-school program at Telpochcalli Elementary also includes running, and his mom tags along sometimes! https://t.co/j7V32lqvEF The Chicago Arts Partnership in Education (CAPE) just held an impressive art exhibit featuring the work of students from different schools, including North-Grand High School and Telpochcalli Elementary, both in my district. https://t.co/wCgqYm0psG Hundreds of thousands of young, talented DREAMers have benefited from the implementation of DACA. DACA recipients are the lawyers, business owners, and teachers who serve as the backbone of my home in the fourth district. They deserve to live without fear. #ProtectDACA Wishing my friend and tireless predecessor Luis Gutierrez a fast recovery. Follow the doctor‚Äôs orders and don‚Äôt give your wife a hard time. https://t.co/TCbmB4ibLu My deepest condolences @RepDebDingell. John Dingell helped shape crucial legislation in the US Congress, including civil rights and health care. His legacy of bipartisanship is something we should aspire to. I joined @TransportDems to be a voice for my constituents and to help build a transportation system that works for everyone. Watch my first Committee hearing remarks here:  https://t.co/wGQ0bYvhdA People in my community use pay day lenders to get cash.

How can something so valuable to people not be a national priority? #TheCostOfInaction https://t.co/DWubXlIK91 Today, @TransportDems will address our country's critical need for infrastructure investment. Because Chicago is one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation, fixing America's bridges and transit systems must be a priority. https://t.co/rwll2rGQV1 I am an immigrant. I take this issue personally. The way the President has characterized immigrants denigrates the dignity and the humanity of millions around the world, including myself. Watch my speech on the floor of the House of Representatives here: https://t.co/qAKnrhxrxB Trump gave one of the longest SOTU speeches ever but he failed to present an infrastructure plan to rebuild railways and transit and put people back to work.

We must continue to work to ensure all children are accounted for and reunited with their families. https://t.co/TqT4JBYRNV Thanks to @icirr for the invite! Walls are not a solution.

What‚Äôs worse, employees of contractors will not get paid. Congress needs to address the aftermath of the #TrumpShutdown and pass a bill that pays all workers.

The 6 million victims of the Holocaust and the lessons from their fate should never be forgotten. #WeRemember https://t.co/pe5KDjeAGN Today's news of mandatory ground stops of flights is deeply concerning.

We will not allow these young people to be used as a bargaining chip for @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs border wall. I and other House Democrats will not stop fighting for a proper pathway to citizenship.
