RT @RepElaineLuria: Joint Statement from Representatives Elaine Luria, @RepSpanberger, @RepWexton, @RepDonBeyer, and @GerryConnolly Calling‚Ä¶ Mr. Dingell was a true friend to Michigan‚Äôs automakers. And like any good friend, he pushed them to better themselves. 

He will be remembered for his tireless work to protect the backbone of our economy in southeast Michigan when times were tough. 

https://t.co/kmHdfkI7e8 This week, I cosponsored the Raise the Wage Act to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2024.

It‚Äôs time to recognize the value of work ‚Äì no one who works full time in this country should have to live in poverty. https://t.co/B29qxpOdNY My dear friend, John Dingell was a true leader and devoted his life‚Äôs work to our great nation and the bettering of generations to come. Congressman John Dingell made immeasurable contributions to our home state of Michigan over nearly six decades of service in the United States House of Representatives. Today, the world lost a giant: for justice, for healthcare, for the environment, and for the advancement of American innovation. We love you John and Debbie Dingell! https://t.co/UJjI6SfeU9 Last month, I had the pleasure of meeting a young girl named Nora on the day I was sworn in as a Member of Congress. Her dad just sent me her journal entry.

Come back any time, Nora! This office could be yours someday. https://t.co/Wqyli3kxK8 Great talking to @EENewsUpdates about the future of the automotive industry, the importance of taking climate science seriously, and what it‚Äôs like to serve as co-president of this historic freshman class! 
https://t.co/6K5IqFTiLw .@TheOaklandPress @MarkCavitt caught up with Jean Buller, a middle school science teacher from #MI11 and my first #SOTU guest, about her trip to D.C. and the science lesson she gave me during lunch! 

We miss you already, Jean!
https://t.co/hpTCw5euxW Today, I had my first committee hearing as a Member of Congress.

The topic? Examining threats to workers with pre-existing conditions.

Watch the full hearing: https://t.co/iJrF8ss9MR https://t.co/mblT0W5a8c Inspiring to see today‚Äôs judiciary committee hearing on background checks stacked with #MarchForOurLives student leaders.

https://t.co/4enWZk2p37 Today the House of Representatives will be holding its first hearing on climate change in 10 years. There is no ‚Äúplanet B,‚Äù we desperately need to work together to stop climate change. To everyone back home, please drive safe in the freezing rain! Schools are closed, and a little patience and caution goes a long way in keeping us all safe. I was encouraged that the President wants a bipartisan solution on immigration, and I hope he will follow up on that commitment by stepping back and letting Congress come to an agreement. My thoughts on last night‚Äôs #SOTU: 

I would have liked to hear more about public education, protecting students from gun violence, protecting our natural resources, and leading the future by investing in innovation and research. 100 years ago, women were finally granted the right to vote.

Today, there are dozens of amazing women in Congress working to defend our democracy and restore faith in government.

I'm proud to have a #SOTU guest who has done that for so many students in my district. Thank you, Jean Buller! Excited to have Jean Buller as my guest for the #StateoftheUnion! She's a retired middle school science teacher from Walled Lake! We need to support our public school STEM teachers to improve our education and our future. https://t.co/LsA1xss7j0 The time is now.
