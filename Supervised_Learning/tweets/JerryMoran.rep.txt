Thank you, Pat, for your friendship and many years of service. https://t.co/dBJSq3SBCY During Starks‚Äô confirmation hearing before @SenateCommerce in June, I was pleased to introduce him and share his Kansas roots with the committee. üåª¬†https://t.co/YTf3vQn4zf Following last night‚Äôs confirmation by the Senate, Geoffrey Starks becomes the 3rd Kansan to serve on the @FCC. A Leawood native with a dedicated career in public service, I look forward to working with him to tackle issues faced by consumers and the FCC. https://t.co/bv2qWSTG7S I was pleased to help welcome Dennis Butler as @RileyCountyPD‚Äôs new director on Monday. A member of my U.S. Service Academy Selection Board, I look forward to continuing to work with Dennis and to see his impact on our communities. https://t.co/4eCfoDWbRX Informative visit today with compassionate professionals at @LMHorg who provide care in Lawrence, Douglas County and the surrounding region. https://t.co/n5HWjvjbJA The inclusion of the FARMERS First Act in the #FarmBill will provide the ag community with necessary mental health programs, such as a crisis help line and suicide prevention training for farm advocates during tumultuous times for our producers. More ‚¨á https://t.co/vQsLbagYKZ As 2018 comes to a close, I'm reflecting on my work, the work of the Senate, and the things done for Kansans by my staff. Thank you for a memorable and productive year! https://t.co/r2sfkxNYu3 I‚Äôm committed to helping make certain @NASA continues to inspire our future innovators and has the tools it needs to recruit and retain top talent, especially those interested in #STEM. https://t.co/NNYUPBYH0G .@RoyBlunt and I are working to uncover how and why this policy change was made. In October, we met with @HRSAGov Administrator Dr. Sigounas for more information and transparency on this policy. More: https://t.co/OV7LEq5489 Decisions by the OPTN, @HRSAGov and @HHSGov that could cause patients at Kansas City-area hospitals to wait longer for liver transplantation are short-sighted and were made with little transparency. See what it could mean for patients: https://t.co/wajZmfX9Jz In November, I brought stakeholders across Kansas together to discuss land and water conservation practices to better inform my work in Washington, D.C. See highlights from my 13th #KansasConservationTour and learn more about the day‚Äôs events: https://t.co/TWFj5WRcfv The Farm Bill will usher in a new array of mental health programs and resources for the ag community and rural America. https://t.co/Sro5FriNau As we gather with loved ones to celebrate this season, I am thinking of all the men and women in uniform who are unable to be with their friends and family as they fight to protect our homeland. We pray for your safety, and wish you a happy holiday and a Merry Christmas. https://t.co/HIEDEexpel That deliberation ought to involve consultation with our nation‚Äôs top national security leaders and military officers overseeing operations in Syria, as well as with our anti-ISIS coalition partners. https://t.co/MzT54P2d5u I join my Senate colleagues in calling on President Trump to reconsider his decision of a full withdrawal from Syria at this time. Substantive deliberation regarding a withdrawal strategy in Syria is needed. He demonstrates a character and resolve that our enemies should fear and our allies can trust. The men and women who serve our nation deserve stability during this time of transition and uncertainty as we face growing global threats. https://t.co/Axmmj2GHlh I have great respect for Secretary Mattis and his nearly 46 years of service to our nation. Over the course of his honorable career, he has undeniably been one of the most influential leaders of our Armed Forces. Last night, I voted against the stop-gap funding measure that punts decisions on government spending and border security. I want Kansans to know that I oppose the way we did business last night and I remain convinced we could‚Äôve reached an agreement on these spending bills. https://t.co/vJnGrz32SR The American people are tired of stop-gap funding measures &amp; partisan politics. Rather than resorting to another CR, we ought to work together to get back to the basics of governing. Punting on spending decisions now will only make funding the government in Feb. more difficult. I voted in opposition to the short-term and short-sighted CR. Democrat leaders‚Äô refusal to compromise is extremely frustrating, and after speaking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I remain convinced that we could have reached a long-term agreement. Speaking on the Senate floor regarding decisions made by OPTN and @HHSGov, and what it could mean for patients at Kansas City-area hospitals waiting for liver transplants. Watch live:

This is great news for Kansas and yet another reminder of the tremendous work being done in the Air Capital of the World! https://t.co/5YAlE26Go9 My statement: https://t.co/nH7f5FsNB3 BREAKING: The Senate just passed the bipartisan #FirstStepAct, making historic progress on #CriminalJusticeReform. This legislation is an important first step in promoting a fair and effective criminal justice system. https://t.co/bYTDY9pR7W Efforts like this by @DotteGrocer are an example of innovative work to eliminate food deserts in our state. As co-founder of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I commend their efforts to make healthy, nutritious food accessible to kids and families. https://t.co/teeNSJKsSc Great work by pilot, Salina native and @USD305 alum Mark Stucky for his successful test flight onboard the Virgin Galactic last week. His successful mission makes all of Kansas proud and brings us one step closer to commercial space flight! https://t.co/uMrd1fdGcu ‚ÄúOral chemotherapy is a priority for @KUCancerCenter and for @AACI_Cancer, and we are delighted that Senators Moran and Smith are introducing this much-needed legislation.‚Äù - @RoyJensenMD @AACI_President
https://t.co/wRXrPUhiQS The #FirstStepAct‚Äôs investment in training and educational programs would change lives and help provide a significant return on taxpayers‚Äô investments in these programs. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/FNtFYcRb5M This afternoon, the Senate will take an important procedural vote on this historic legislation, moving it one step closer to @POTUS‚Äô desk. #FirstStepAct https://t.co/F2FDBKqgag Proud to work with you in partnership on this and appreciate your many efforts on behalf of those suffering from cancer. https://t.co/E3kJzNiq8L Support for the Cancer Drug Parity Act I introduced with @SenTinaSmith is growing. See what leaders of the nation‚Äôs top cancer advocacy groups are saying: https://t.co/wRXrPTZHsi This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity for Congress to make historic progress on much-needed criminal justice reform.

Let‚Äôs pass this bill. https://t.co/P3H6NWz69z RT @KUcancercenter: The Cancer Drug Parity Act which has just been introduced in the @USSenate  restores the doctor-patient relationship wh‚Ä¶ Rock Chalk! Great to watch @KUHoops edge Villanova today in Allen Fieldhouse! #RCJH https://t.co/zOTCRP6M7k Because of these false claims, survivors of abuse have had to wait longer for the truth and longer for systemic changes to help prevent others from similar injury.
https://t.co/qXa0fcl06P BREAKING: @SenBlumenthal and I have referred the former head of the U.S. Olympic Committee Scott Blackmun to the Department of Justice for potentially making false claims and misleading our Subcommittee‚Äôs investigation. https://t.co/qlLD9IJNZg This headline shouldn‚Äôt have to exist. If we're successful in determining who is abusing athletes but they continue to find employment elsewhere, then we‚Äôve accomplished nothing. Our work isn‚Äôt over.
https://t.co/Xsn7IxXDQp I‚Äôm grateful for General Vincent Brooks and his dedicated years of service to our nation, especially while commanding soldiers of the @FightingFirst.
