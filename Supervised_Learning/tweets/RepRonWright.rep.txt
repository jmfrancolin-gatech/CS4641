My heart is heavy to learn of the passing of Arlington Police Chaplin Harold Elliot. He was a good man and a friend of mine. He was loved by all and will be dearly missed. @ArlingtonPD https://t.co/WWaZE4rh6Y @kketb Wearing my pin today in to highlight the #Enditmovement https://t.co/TJOWy8QZXR Attending a round table with the Estonian Ambassador discussing Russian aggression and ways to combat it. #ForeignAffairs https://t.co/rgwyUPXb7o @momisaverb So important that we as members of Congress keep our priorities straight! I am saddened as well to see any hatred for a prayer breakfast. Sitting with representatives from Pakistan, Uganda, Namibia, and Greece at the National #PrayerBreakfast this morning. https://t.co/JjsuDK78ID If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Chron 7:14 #PrayerBreakfast Great to see so many colleagues this morning! RT @EdLaborGOP: Republican Leader @virginiafoxx talks with tipped workers who would lose their jobs in a $15 fed min wage hike. Oddly, they‚Ä¶ Enjoyed hosting you in my office. I am looking forward to working with our good friends to the north. https://t.co/RT6CITN2MY When a servant falls we should remember and honor them. Godspeed Agent Doss. #BorderPatrol https://t.co/JBaOVrpoaH @POTUS was very clear about his vision for America! #ChooseGreatness #SOTU2019 @POTUS was very clear with his vision for America‚Äôs future. 

On the issues that matter most, protecting freedom and the American people, he is unwavering. He showed strength on border security, and on national security! Keep it up sir! #SOTU2019 I was heartened to hear @POTUS strong stance in favor of the unborn and innocent life. Promoting a culture that protects and honors life is essential to the moral fabric of our country. What the states of New York and Virginia have done and are supporting is abominable #SOTU19 I am looking forward to attending President Trumps' second #SOTU Address. It will air at 9pm EST Make sure to tune in. https://t.co/R0HMe7GZ9K Medicare for all is Medicare for none! The socialist healthcare system that many Democrats are talking about would destroy future healthcare for the very people they profess to protect and the only thing that Democrats‚Äô socialized medicine will equalize is misery. #healthcare My prayers and heartfelt thanks for her service. May she rest in peace. https://t.co/aYZ7GvTQlx Thank you for hosting us today. Great time spent with people who are working to strengthen business in all of Texas. Enjoyed spending time with my colleagues as well. https://t.co/FWLJlot04B RT @RepMarkWalker: .@RalphNortham, third trimester babies want to finish their term as well. 304,000 Jobs added in January!

We have seen blatant anti catholic and anti-Semitic moves by Dems and this is just another step in that direction. #congress #faith @ski4me1 @HouseForeignGOP Thank you! I will keep them awake. Work got underway at my first Foreign Affairs Committee meeting today. Let‚Äôs get to it. @HouseForeignGOP https://t.co/lUQFUp3XRR Preach! My space heater is turned to high in preparation. #PolarVortex2019 https://t.co/mkqtxI12Xa God bless #Texas https://t.co/jkRDXjgP9a This is very concerning and erodes confidence in our elections. I applaud the Secretary of State and Attorney General for looking into this, and I hope they‚Äôre quickly able to get to the bottoms of this. https://t.co/AbsjgkvqQ4 This is a great story. Texans showed up today! #TexasVeterans https://t.co/5Qup8Y1pr2 May we never forget. 74 years ago as of yesterday. #Auschwitz https://t.co/3m5DNseOtL If you live in Navarro County this is very important for you!

Talk of who won or lost is premature because the fight to secure the border and protect the American people is not over. I am grateful that workers will now be paid. Lets secure the border #SecureOurBorder Democrat Leadership can‚Äôt stand the thought of allowing @POTUS to speak before the American people while the gov is shutdown! The same Leadership that is using border security as a bargaining chip. Stop the grandstanding Madam Speaker and start negotiating. #SecureOurBorder Grateful to be serving with these members! https://t.co/RBEWwQslgj Thankfully Israel has an excellent missile defense program Iranian forces would have succeeded in killing many civilians! Congress must continue to stand with Israel and make sure they have the support they need. #StandwithIsrael #Israel 
https://t.co/scYqzAF8gL This weekend @POTUS proved once again that he is ready to negotiate. Sadly the democrats showed they are more interested in continuing to play petty politics than securing our citizens future. It‚Äôs time to stop using our nations security as a bargaining chip. #SecureOurBorder Grateful the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals got it right! #sanctityoflifesunday #prolife #marchforlife https://t.co/oWBy1XHeUM RT @RepChipRoy: Congress should be in Washington to work on securing our border. I am here. Why is ‚Å¶@SpeakerPelosi‚Å© closing the People‚Äôs Ho‚Ä¶ Thankful for the thousands who gathered to march for life today in DC and for all those who are fighting for the lives of the unborn around the country. I will always fight to protect the unborn! #MarchForLife #ProLife üëÄ Your move Madam Speaker #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/xPdaaK0Khu Thanks for the highlight! It was a good day.

We have a lot of work to do but my focus is on serving the interest of the 6th District. https://t.co/xUomolGaO5 Walls work! #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/ZXWz6waaTf Congratulations to our Texas @GovAbbott and Lt. Gov @DanPatrick on their inauguration today. God bless Texas. #TexasStrong @POTUS compromise has included things dems asked for but they still refuse to come to the table. With every refusal they will continue to own this shutdown. Effective compromise only succeeds if both sides work out a solution without sacrificing border security! #SecureOurBorder The Democrats are nowhere to be found in Washington this weekend but I‚Äôm here in case they want to begin actual negations with the @POTUS #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/zEQtkcHw05 My thoughts and prayers are with the Arlington Police Department and especially the officer who was shot last night. One more example of how dangerous their jobs are protecting the rest of us. Yesterday standing next to a steel wall Jim Acosta made @POTUS point for him from McAllen, TX saying that the absence of migrants was proof that the border crisis was fake. His report did prove one thing - where there‚Äôs a wall there is no crisis. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/4qARgrhvRI RT @cspan: President Trump, @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz receive #BorderSecurity briefing - LIVE on C-SPAN3 https://t.co/ZH7GxWenrm https://t.c‚Ä¶ I fully support the president‚Äôs insistence on funding for border security. I understand the difficulty that Democratic intransigence is causing many federal workers, therefore, I will defer my own pay.
https://t.co/kYiR8AQYR8 My heartfelt thanks to all law enforcement officers and Personel who protect and serve the people of the 6th District. We are blessed by your sacrifice and that of your family. God bless each of you. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay @momisaverb Thank you! The safety and security of the American people should never be used as a bargaining chip. #SecureOurBorder President Trump understands border security is essential to keeping Americans safe and preserving our sovereignty.
#SecureOurBorder America should be a welcoming, hospitable refuge for people who are seeking to better their lives and raise their families in a safe place. We are a nation of laws and those laws protect those who become citizens legally. #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity At the White House Speaker Pelosi dismissed Sec. Nielsen‚Äôs presentation by saying, ‚ÄúI reject your facts.‚Äù Sorry Madam Speaker, you are welcome to your own opinion, but you are not welcome to your own set of facts. The facts are what they are. #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity We could have continued the debate about responsibly for the partial shutdown. But by requiring a new precondition for going forward such as ending the shutdown first, the Democrats now own it. #GovernmentShutdown #BorderSecurity Speaker Pelosi proclaiming the wall is immoral is reckless and theologically groundless. How grand it must be to proclaim new standards of morality whenever it benefits a political objective! #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity Last night I joined @trish_regan show on @FoxBusiness to talk about the government shutdown and the failure of the Democrats to put the security of the American people first. @MelissaAFrancis #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity 
https://t.co/yr4I57ojXv Well said by my Texas colleague. Also why would Dems be so anxious to ignore the safety of American citizens in favor of illegal immigrants? It‚Äôs time to put our citizens safety first! #FundTheWall https://t.co/tvCqzdVL1J @unlobodelnorte Thank you! Later this evening I will be on Fox Business Network. Tune in at 8 pm. We will be discussing the government shutdown and border security. #GovernmentShutdown
