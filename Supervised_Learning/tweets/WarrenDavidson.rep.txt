@GOP cheers!!! Sadly, @DNC has 1/2 seated, sad, and defiant. In 1989 while in Berlin, seeing people experience their first hours of freedom, I would have never imagined it. The economic success built on GOP growth-oriented policies, was a highlight of tonight's #SOTU. The best jobs environment in a half-century is no small accomplishment, and the +300K jobs added‚Äîaccording to last Friday‚Äôs jobs report‚Äîsuggest hope for continued strong growth. "in fact, only 26 states have affirmative protections for unborn children born alive after attempted abortions. ... the bill comes on the heels of Virginia governor Ralph Northam‚Äôs recent comments appearing to defend allowing some newborn infants to die"

However, only citizens should be counted for apportionment. @greggmcpherson I know markets work and everyone knows some markets are broken. Effective laws make markets work. E.g. HR372 last Congress would have ended antitrust exemptions for health insurance, passed 416-7. I oppose monopolies, oligopolies, and kleptocracy. A republic, if you can keep it!

For years, Members have had an interest in ensuring military operations follow the constitution. Only Congress has pwr to declare war. #AUMF I've personally offered multiple amendments to cease existing combat outside the scope of current authorization of military force. All predate the death of Jamal Khashoggi. There is a time for war, but there is also a time to vote. An AUMF debate and vote is long overdue. #CitizenshipMatters Every person has dignity; identity is central to humanity. An important distinction: legal vs illegal. Inherently, welcome immigrant vs criminal. Foreigners have ambassadors. Americans have the US Constitution. Only citizens should count for apportionment. https://t.co/jYJmGlZbam When on offense, play offense. https://t.co/CWudKRjHtJ While ISIS territory shrinks, their hateful and violent ideology persists. I am profoundly thankful for the men and women of our federal, state, and local law enforcement for their efforts to keep us safe!
https://t.co/Ue4IEc8m1C Yet another example of the injustice of civil asset forfeiture. The @senategop should not move a justice reform bill without ending this immoral and unjust practice.

https://t.co/1omJFtQ0UF @Payne4TXSHRD120 @FreedomWorks We will continue doing that; however, as the link explains, the language keeps getting stripped out ahead of final passage. SCOTUS should get this right AND Congress should formally end civil asset forfeiture with unambiguous language. RLTW! This decision from South Africa's highest court, home of the Constitution US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg praised as superior to America's... https://t.co/6nVlnPPg3J via @MailOnline End civil asset forfeiture.
