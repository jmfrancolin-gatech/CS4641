Yesterday I met the new Ambassador of India to the United States, Harsh Vardhan Shringla. Ambassador Shringla is a brilliant diplomat and was previously the Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh. It was excellent meeting him and I am glad to now call him a friend! https://t.co/P454uxbwIp Olympic gold medal hockey player @skrooops28 started playing hockey at age 4 in Rockville. I‚Äôm wishing her good luck in the U.S. Women‚Äôs National Team‚Äôs upcoming series against Canada! https://t.co/akiLQ400Bv My daughter was named at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. I knew many families there. We must stand up against anti-Semitism and stand with the Jewish people #SOTU Modern border security means increased funding for technology, surveillance, border patrol officers, and immigration judges. Not a fifth century wall. #SOTU We can and must work together to address our broken criminal justice system that disproportionally affects minorities and people of color. The bipartisan First Step Act was a great start - and we must do more. #SOTU19 We must do both. Legislate on issues of common ground and investigate issues of corruption. #SOTU19 The Trump Administration‚Äôs tax cut helped the wealthy - and they don‚Äôt need the help. To put it simply, the Trump administration has failed the middle class. #SOTU19
https://t.co/8mwDx3Eq5B Tom Wibberley, another Maryland 6th District resident, is at the #SOTU19 tonight. Tom lost his son Craig at the age of 19 while he was serving our country abroad. We honor Craig and his father Tom tonight for their sacrifice for our country. We have to take this strength that we have here in Hagerstown and spread it across Maryland and across the United States.

Mr. President - please help lead us tonight and speak about this catastrophe to give it the attention it deserves. Literally thousands of Brookes all over America are being claimed by this epidemic. My nephew Ian was one of them. He died at the age of 24 from a fentanyl overdose.

This is not a tragedy of just Hagerstown or Maryland, it‚Äôs the most important tragedy that America faces. https://t.co/5xG86MsHlA I‚Äôm honored to have Kevin Simmers as my guest to the #SOTU19 tonight. Kevin lost his daughter Brooke to an overdose at the age of 19. He took action after that tragedy and today officially opened Brooke‚Äôs House - a safe living facility for women seeking treatment from addiction. https://t.co/ti1MUWFgSu We must support the press and the work they do to report the truth. Their work is more important now than ever before. https://t.co/33icyREStr Phil who? The real weather predicting groundhog is right here in the 6th district. #MD06 

https://t.co/2mS205SoVK RT @ADANews: Dr. Harvey Levy's office in Frederick, Md., treated 50 children during today's #GiveKidsASmile. Dr. Levy received a citation f‚Ä¶ I am proud to recognize Frederick Dentist Dr. Harvey Levy who, as a part of National Children‚Äôs Dental Health Month, provided free dental care to 50 under-served children today. https://t.co/CkVqXMV2Op Border Patrol just made the largest fentanyl bust in U.S history. 

A wall didn't keep these drugs out. It was the work and expertise of CBP officers. We must continue to invest in smart border security to stop these deadly drugs from entering the U.S. 

https://t.co/JdTi73pVdj Huge win for federal workers today. My first amendment passed on the House floor, giving a 2.6% pay increase for Secret Service along with all other federal employees.

After 35 days of an unnecessary shutdown, federal workers deserve better. I stand with you. https://t.co/oW08e5LbJu Poverty is unjust. We need to take action to reverse this trend. https://t.co/IWAXDhmgMS Now more than ever we need to unite against foreign threats and fight for American values abroad. That's why I'm excited to get to work on my two subcommittees in @HouseForeign:

- Middle East, North Africa, &amp; International Terrorism
- Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment I'm excited to announce that in the @EdLaborCmte I will serve on the Subcommittees on:

üçéHigher Education and Workforce Investment
üçéCivil Rights and Human Services

It's time to think long-term and invest in success of all students and workers. A year after the Trump Administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut, 84% of companies say they didn't change any hiring or investment plans.

This tax cut for the wealthiest corporations was a bad business decision that left the American worker behind.

https://t.co/V5yToA0kGD Trump‚Äôs Muslim ban is just plain wrong. Immigrants make our country stronger, and we must support those negatively affected by this ridiculous policy. #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/l1ArlajCri A good notification for federal workers everywhere. 

While the government is now open, we cannot forget that federal workers and contractors had no pay for 35 days, and we still don‚Äôt know the many after effects. We cannot allow this to happen again. https://t.co/Fm9XJz5DsU On this #HolocaustRemembrenceDay, we remember the 6 million Jews that were killed during the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism still exists, and today is another reminder of the importance of standing with and supporting the Jewish people. https://t.co/fJChnVyk11 This is outrageous. We need to hold big drug companies accountable for their role in the addiction epidemic.

https://t.co/Hc1pc76D4W I had many important conversations at PACE about how we can support the people and economies of Allegany and Garrett Counties. We need to focus on funds to combat the opioid epidemic, greater access to broadband, and funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. https://t.co/MN6P7sx7Mp I wrote about the bipartisan trip I took to Israel before being sworn-in to Congress. The visit emphasized the importance of our bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel alliance and gave me optimism that both sides can work together in the future.

https://t.co/0oN01u61tG I'm proud to support this bill with @RepAnthonyBrown that would guarantee unemployment benefits to federal employees while the government is shut down. https://t.co/V9jcDe7VO0 In business, it's always about serving the customer.

Today, the customers were federal employees who haven't been paid for 33 days because of the #TrumpShutdown. Thanks to @chefjoseandres &amp; @WCKitchen for letting me, @SenatorCardin @ChrisVanHollen &amp; @RepJeffries help out today. https://t.co/cVGP3blTrY I‚Äôm standing in silence with hundreds of federal workers and @IndivisibleMoCo today in the Senate Office Building to protest the number of days the government has been shut down. 

Mitch McConnell needs to bring a vote to the floor to reopen the government now. #EndtheShutdown https://t.co/mvkTMhNXUi Had a great sendoff this morning! https://t.co/czZ97x3mm2 33 days.
 
That‚Äôs how long 800,000 workers have been watching @realDonaldTrump hold their paychecks hostage as he tries to force U.S. taxpayers ‚Äî not Mexico ‚Äî to pay for his ineffective wall.
 
This isn‚Äôt a game, Mr. President. You must re-open government now!  #EndTheShutdown @Tristan_Dietz @RepRaskin Frederick County has resources on their website to help during the shutdown. Check them out here: https://t.co/p6J5gPGsoq &amp; call my office at 301-926-0300 with any further questions you may have about resources for federal workers and contractors during the shutdown. To me, a woman's right to make decisions about her own body is just common sense. This is why on #Roe46 I'm proud to announce that I have joined the Pro-Choice Caucus and am committed to preserving a woman's right to choose. I will always #FightForRoe https://t.co/FOC3gvf8JT With today's SCOTUS ruling, thousands of proud transgender service members are now at risk of being discharged. These patriots and their families make our military stronger, and they deserve to be protected.

https://t.co/MCAnybfJwm Just asked our Latino Advisory Board if the #TrumpTaxCut bill helped them. These are entrepreneurs and business owners, and not one raised their hand. The truth is there‚Äôs no crisis at the border. No crisis at all. 

It‚Äôs a made up problem and the President is holding 800k employees ‚Äî without pay ‚Äî hostage. #EndtheShutdown üëèüëèüëè https://t.co/EgEsaIaTbr A great tribute to Frederick resident Tony Mendez, who passed away today. Tony lived an incredibly meaningful life. He will be remembered for his bravery and courage. https://t.co/pPHPVDARyp We need: 

- a permanent solution for Dreamers. 
- border security that is smart and strategic.
- to reopen the government. Immediately.

What we don‚Äôt need:
‚ùåa wall

The President needs to end this shutdown. Thanks to @airbnb for doing their part to help federal employees in #md06 

https://t.co/BSIRm7puGn As a Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I will advocate for a foreign policy that aligns with U.S. values and prioritizes national security.

https://t.co/vzfzrDvxDb Real people are suffering from the #TrumpShutdown. 

For resources to help navigate the shutdown, check out NARFE‚Äôs website for information related to the shutdown and answers to some common questions.  

https://t.co/tFUIXfuYUj During a crisis my company would offer zero interest loans to help those that needed it. 

That‚Äôs why today I talked about the bill I‚Äôm helping introduce with @RepTjCox that would allow the 800,000 federal workers who haven‚Äôt been paid to do the same. 

Let‚Äôs #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/AXQv5TjVps I'm joining the Education and Labor Committee to fight for children and workers everywhere.

I know the importance of good wages and benefits to a strong workforce. I'll fight to ensure workers get treated fairly.

https://t.co/7DjbBniuLX True leadership means taking care of your people and your workers. President Trump isn‚Äôt doing that. 

I joined @LeaderHoyer and @RepKatieHill to see some of the agencies affected by the #TrumpShutdown. We must #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/kJclDWxSCg It's time to talk about how the #TrumpShutdown is affecting real people.

If you have a story about how the #TrumpShutdown is affecting you and your family, please share with us at https://t.co/k9Q9VRRKeE I‚Äôm glad to see that Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments - but that‚Äôs not enough.

There is no room for white supremacy in Congress. He should step down immediately. https://t.co/b0ga06fmDX Let‚Äôs look at the numbers.

‚ùå800,000 workers missed their paychecks
‚ùå$3.6 billion lost in GDP from shutdown and growing
‚ùå Longest government shutdown ever (23 days)

The Government shutdown is bad for business and bad for people. Let‚Äôs end this now. https://t.co/PGN0Vk3iRi RT @LeaderHoyer: Today, @RepKatieHill, @repdavidtrone, and I visited @FAANews, @HUDgov, @US_FDA, &amp; @NOAA in DC and MD‚Äîall of which have lar‚Ä¶ I joined the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force led by @RepThompson to help introduce #HR8 that would implement universal background checks. We must address gun violence now.

It was an honor meeting the leaders of this fight @GabbyGiffords and @sarahetrumble from @Everytown https://t.co/cKo5NETkDZ After decades in business, never once have I uttered these words. https://t.co/sIi0emcFs6 My number one priority in Congress is tackling the opioid epidemic. That‚Äôs why one of the first meetings in my office was with doctors from Johns Hopkins University. We talked about how we can bring their research on opioids into real change in Congress. https://t.co/Y3dP34vFnx RT @kylegriffin1: Moments ago on the Senate floor, Ben Cardin asked for unanimous consent from all senators to pass one of the House-approv‚Ä¶ We need to start thinking about the individuals affected by the shutdown. In Cumberland, we have prison guard union workers who are in dangerous jobs that are now working without pay. We must stand up for these workers.

Mr. President, it‚Äôs time to get everybody back to work. https://t.co/cHxZFxHucl SNAP benefits are crucial to many low-income American families as they pay for groceries every month. I am proud to support @rosadelauro to make sure we protect SNAP benefits during this shutdown.

https://t.co/TzpUhHlpY5 It‚Äôs time we talk about the real people and workers from #MD06 who are affected by this shutdown. Tune in at 10am to hear some of these stories. https://t.co/M0h8biMyI8 So impressed to meet these young people who are changing the world and speaking out about the atrocities of gun violence.  

It was an honor to meet you @davidhogg111 @JaclynCorin @charlie_mirsky @mattlpost. 

Congress has a lot to learn from your leadership. https://t.co/0o3hefSVQF An estimated 23,119 federal workers in Maryland are either furloughed or working without pay. It‚Äôs time to end the #TrumpShutdown and fund the federal government. 

@AppropsDems https://t.co/7J4AMr5nju We need to end the #TrumpShutdown and let federal employees go back to work. $5 billion for a wall is a waste of money and goes against our values as a country. ‚úÖ Provide 1.4 million teachers with school supplies they usually pay for out of their own pockets
‚úÖ Increase before and after school opportunities for 250,000 children ‚úÖ Increase primary health care services for thousands
‚úÖ Provide 27,262 units of affordable housing and create 11,401 jobs 
‚úÖ Meet and maintain standards for drinking water and waste infrastructure With $5 billion, we could make a lot of change in Maryland‚Äôs 6th District and our country: We could do ALL of the below:
‚úÖ Create 2,078 units of housing for the disabled
‚úÖ Repave 1,679 miles of 2 lane highway
‚úÖ Increase access to Head Start for 36,000 low-income children Many of these employees live in the district I represent, #MD06. They cannot pay their mortgages, utilities, or car payments. These are real people being affected by a reckless decision from the President to build an unnecessary $5 billion border wall. Recognizing the detrimental impact of the #TrumpShutdown on federal employees and families, I‚Äôve decided to make one of my first acts as a representative to cosponsor @RepDonBeyer‚Äôs bill on retroactive pay for federal employees affected by the closing of the federal government. RT @RepCummings: Mr. President, I agree. But that‚Äôs been true for the last two years. In 2017, I asked you to endorse my bill to let Medica‚Ä¶ Military outlets like Ft. Dertrick in Frederick do not deserve to lose funding for an unnecessary border wall. Supporting our military and their families should be our top priority. Anything else is inexcusable.

https://t.co/4adg7Sfl2V With $5 billion, we could buy 38 million doses of narcan and fund thousands of medical research grants. Funding a wall is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of money. https://t.co/eYNqtTq2DS Look at those faces! Couldn‚Äôt be happier that my four kids were able to come to my Swearing-In ceremony today. I‚Äôm honored to be your next Representative for the 6th District of Maryland! #MD06 https://t.co/RmGcnvf4sF
