This morning I attended the Bellwood Family Health and Safety Fair, which was held at the Bellwood Library. Enjoyed meeting Excelsior Fire Company Chief Chris Cherry, as well as members Taylor Cherry, Tommy Whiteford, Bryant Mahute and David Kell. https://t.co/Tyr6Iihkgg For the 3rd straight day members of the @HouseGOP have tried to bring legislation to ban infanticide to the floor. For the 3rd straight day Democrats have blocked us. We must continue to persist and stand up for life. It's time the Democrats join us. https://t.co/8ubQpNjhYN Today we're launching the first edition of my weekly newsletter.

Looking forward to continuing to meet with local officials to learn how I can be helpful to them in Washington. https://t.co/convIDywZT Last week I visited @VolvoCE_NA at their office in Shippensburg, so this week I invited them to come see mine. Was important to have their representatives at the table for a discussion on improving our nation’s infrastructure. https://t.co/craOBsXBWv As a doctor, I have treated many patients who rely on the Medicare Advantage for their healthcare costs. We need to continue to protect affordable access to healthcare for seniors by keeping this incredibly important program in place. https://t.co/rCm1Ul1QuY Thank you to the leaders of Pennsylvania’s Office of Rural Health for stopping by my office today to discuss how we can better support rural health centers in PA. We have three fantastic ones in #PA13! https://t.co/04TgxMdBpR Proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which ensures that any infant born alive after an abortion receives the same protection of law as any newborn. It’s time to stand up for life, send this bill to President Trump’s desk and put an end to infanticide. https://t.co/xuRz8mrqqS RT @repgregwalden: What’s the cost of a $32 trillion one-size-fits-all, government-run health care system?

Eliminates private/employer-spo… This morning I joined @Newstalk1037fm to discuss what it was like to attend the State of the Union. Listen here → https://t.co/nqAnUYPdoR In tonight’s State of the Union address @realDonaldTrump made it crystal clear to all Americans that we are moving full speed ahead on a path to prosperity. I stand committed to assisting him in continuing to make America great. 

Watch my full statement on the #SOTU below. https://t.co/lgWyGZGbjS RT @GOPLeader: President Trump is right. Congress should vote to prohibit late-term abortions of children who can feel pain in their mother… "America was founded on liberty and independence - not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country." - @POTUS #SOTU As a doctor, I have seen first-hand how costs of prescription drugs have skyrocketed. I'm glad @realDonaldTrump addressed this important issue tonight and look forward to working with my colleagues in the House on legislation to lower prices for patients. https://t.co/ilzWy1TGa1 More and more people are working under @realDonaldTrump thanks to his efforts to cut taxes and remove regulations. The reduction we've seen in unemployment rates in all of the counties in #PA13 proves it. https://t.co/JNixnikzTY .@realDonaldTrump is right. The economy is booming and the impacts are being felt in #PA13. The 10 counties that I represent have seen their unemployment rates decrease by an average of 23% since he took office. https://t.co/I5u4nV5q9t RT @HouseGOP: Did you know @RepJohnJoyce is doctor? He anticipates the President talking at tonight’s #SOTU about ways to lower healthcare… I am proud to be attending my very first #SOTU tonight. Click here for my full interview with C-SPAN to see what I am expecting to hear from @realDonaldTrump . https://t.co/eMbaEuA4Eq Just a quick reminder to tune in tonight at 9:00PM for the #SOTU

Why would they want to block legislation that would prohibit allowing newborn infants to die without medical care? Every life is a precious gift from God and deserves to be protected. https://t.co/cB229qO6x7 Read all about what I've been up to in Washington during my first month in today's @PONews - Fighting to combat terrorism, secure our border, ban sanctuary cities, protect our dairy farmers and much more. https://t.co/4IOF5SZmMf When I took office in early Jan I decided that I wanted to visit all 10 counties in #PA13 during my 1st month. Today's meeting in Adams County completed that mission. The last month has taught me a great deal and I look forward to continuing to spend time at events back home. https://t.co/WCxRszJiJg The people I represent know as well as any how burdensome regulations can impede farms from reaching their true economic potential, and I look forward to receiving their input on these issues and fighting for the entire agriculture community. https://t.co/qaiHxiwLU6 Spent the afternoon touring @sheetz in Claysburg. Thank you for having me and providing me with insight on your important industry. https://t.co/nOWpYVDesm One of my first actions as a member of the Homeland Security Committee was to sign a letter urging the Conference Committee to take an “all-of-the-above” approach in the ongoing negotiations - including investing in 21st century technology, manpower and physical barriers. https://t.co/G7Iyr07v2W There have been more calls coming into our office in favor of building the wall and securing our border than on any other topic and my increased input on such a critical issue is a positive for the people of the 13th District. https://t.co/kfDTBTEjoE Proud to be working to protect all the dairy farmers in #PA13. Read more about the actions I took this week in today's @tribunedemocrat →  https://t.co/IyelsZ8oet Last night I attended the Chambersburg Ice Fest ribbon cutting. Good to see so many familiar faces in attendance. https://t.co/qCbaGW7iWR This afternoon I visited Occupational Services Inc. in Chambersburg. This outstanding sheltered workshop assists individuals with disabilities or other barriers to employment through vocational programs and employment services. https://t.co/Mme20fMHHK Toured Volvo Construction in Shippensburg this morning. It was great to meet with so many hardworking employees and listen to their ideas. https://t.co/IlIu3jdIwE RT @HouseHomeland: Serving on the Subcommittee On Emergency Preparedness, Response, And Recovery: @RepPeteKing, @RepJohnJoyce, @RepDanCrens… RT @HouseHomeland: @RepMikeRogerAL Serving on the Subcommittee On Border Security, Facilitation, And Operations: @RepClayHiggins, @RepDLesk… This week I led a bipartisan letter urging the FDA to crack down on dairy imitators and cosponsored legislation to allow whole milk to be offered in schools. Click here to learn more about my efforts to protect dairy farmers → https://t.co/3q7n7KNPeG In disbelief that a public official would say this. What is being advocated for is abhorrent, heinous and must be recognized for what it is: murder. It is essential we have leaders who understand that every life is a gift from God and must be protected. https://t.co/zaEV1i7Wo7 I joined Fox and Friends this morning to talk about my strong opposition to "Medicare for All" and how I am looking to make healthcare my number one priority while in Congress. Watch here → https://t.co/2CvNiZOoZk Spent some time this morning with the folks at Pyramid Healthcare's Altoona branch. They are having tremendous success with their opioid rehabilitation program and provided important insight on the epidemic. https://t.co/At4ionLBBe As a new member of the House Committee on Small Business, I'm eager to meet as many local job creators as possible to see what I can do to help them in Washington. This morning, I visited Altoona Pipe &amp; Steel, which provides steel for Sheetz stations across Pennsylvania. https://t.co/KqIEVdqHE5 I joined @Newstalk1037fm this morning to talk about the ongoing negotiations to fund the wall, my new committee assignments, legislation to ban sanctuary cities and the district healthcare tour I have been conducting. Listen here → https://t.co/zveUisLu1l The President has shown a willingness to come to the table multiple times throughout this process and now Democrats must do the same. As we continue to negotiate over the next three weeks, I urge the Democrats to change their tune and send a bill containing wall funding to President Trump’s desk. The people of PA-13 are tired of kicking the can down the road when it comes to securing our border and do not understand why Democrats, who have supported physical barriers in the past, refuse to offer a single dollar for the wall. The reason that the people of our district sent me to Washington is simple: they are fed up with politics as usual. Great visit to New Pig in this afternoon. The Duncansville based company manufactures outstanding spill control products and employs hundreds. https://t.co/fCawFRbIbO Continued my district-wide healthcare tour this morning with a visit to @FCMCPA to discuss the opioid epidemic. Great discussions about the community-based solutions needed to combat the crisis. https://t.co/TIN9RZ3jwq In today's @BedfordGazette I reflect on what my first couple of weeks in office have been like. Click below for my thoughts on fighting the opioid epidemic, securing the border, fixing healthcare, standing up for life and empowering small businesses. https://t.co/0lcXLq13re For the third time the @HouseGOP voted to pay federal workers while we continue to negotiate on the wall. The hardworking men and women at @DHSgov should be receiving paychecks, but the Democrats continue to vote no &amp; have decided to leave town without a solution to the shutdown. Serving on @HouseHomeland will put me at the forefront of our national security issues and is a responsibility I take seriously. https://t.co/JAhMZfWI6I Having signed paychecks for members of my office for over 25 years, I have seen first-hand some of the unique hurdles faced by entrepreneurs in our region. I am eager to get to work on legislation to allow job creators to grow and expand their businesses. https://t.co/0EZKcvNA7p I am honored to have been selected to serve on the House Homeland Security and Small Business committees! Read my full statement here → https://t.co/dGGem7IldZ For the 2nd straight week I voted to retroactively pay federal workers who have been impacted by the shutdown. Only 10 commonsense Democrats joined me. How can anyone claim to support our federal employees &amp; refuse to pay them? Clearly there is a motive to obstruct the President. Enjoyed being at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center yesterday as they had a ribbon cutting for their new radiation oncology unit. I am working hard to see what we can do in Washington to empower this type of innovation in the healthcare industry. https://t.co/TMa00cmMni Yesterday, I toured Somerset Hospital to learn about how it is continuing to grow and expand. Check out the @dailyamerican for the full story on my visit → https://t.co/o1kEzZyqUp During my healthcare listening tour across the 13th District one of the things I'm focusing on is how we can better encourage our children to stay in the region and work at their hometown hospitals. Read more from the @tribunedemocrat here → https://t.co/bgF6siaHnz Providing federal law enforcement officers with all of the assistance they need to implement our immigration laws and keep our citizens safe is of the utmost importance. That is why today I cosponsored legislation to curb sanctuary cities. https://t.co/cPtaRHRBS3 Continued my healthcare listening tour this afternoon with a visit to Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown. Conemaugh had a ribbon cutting ceremony today for their new Radiation Oncology, which will put them at the cutting edge of cancer therapy. https://t.co/L1yfvNWdsa One of my first actions since taking office has been to conduct a listening tour at health centers across the 13th District to see what I can do to assist them in Washington. Great stops earlier today at Somerset Hospital and the Chan Soon-Shiong Medical Center at Windber. https://t.co/tmjGQQ1civ Our prayers are that we can move forward peacefully to the common goals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Today, we honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King reminded us that we are all God's children and that we are all created equal as human beings. I call on Speaker Pelosi to stop the endless obstruction and begin good faith negotiations so we can get back to work for the American people. It seems that nothing will satisfy the Democrats in these negotiations and that they will continue to hold federal workers hostage for the sole purpose of trying to stop President Trump's agenda. To review - President Trump is offering Democrats immigration reforms that they want, and border security that they voted for in the past, but today they are backing away from both. Time and time again throughout the shutdown, President Trump has shown a willingness to compromise so we can secure our border and reopen the government. I call on Speaker Pelosi to begin good faith negotiations so we can secure the border and bring an end to the shutdown. My full statement is here -&gt; https://t.co/GA06rA87As Having my nephews, Samuel and Shane, and my niece, Natalie with me on the House floor this week was a special treat. #ICYMI - click here to watch my remarks on protecting the dignity of human life → https://t.co/7sbOtSme3B https://t.co/MKS5igidCb On my way to advocate for the pro-life agenda on the National Mall. I look forward to seeing many of my friends who have made the trip from #PA later this afternoon at the reception in Capitol Visitors Center, room 217. https://t.co/MZRxFNJvzN Today, I signed on to multiple bills to advance the pro-life cause. Read all about them here →  https://t.co/7JhoounQ4D When I graduated from medical school, I pledged to never perform, assist or facilitate an abortion. The people of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District have sent me to Washington to apply that pledge to my work in Congress as well. https://t.co/n0VnOV8Pry By refusing to meet with @realDonaldTrump today the Democrats proved that they favor playing political games over getting the government up and running and paying federal workers. It’s time to end the gridlock, fund the wall and get back to work for the American people. https://t.co/0QdlEFVMa7 Spent yesterday morning in Altoona to receive a briefing on veteran care and the challenges of the opioid epidemic at the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center. https://t.co/Dh0dgUkjDd I joined WRTA this morning to talk about the need to #SecureOurBorder and bring an end to the shutdown. Listen to the full interview here → https://t.co/jlzuBr4dyJ It's our responsibility in Congress to support quality healthcare research. Innovators like @montaltopsu are at the forefront of the changes we are seeing in the medical field and I learned a great deal from their students on Friday. 

https://t.co/9HVhnEipQC As a doctor, I understand the importance of students receiving hands-on training in the medical field. I will work hard to support such programs in Congress. Click below for coverage from @WDVMTV on my visit to @montaltopsu. https://t.co/6AlUmf6NBL Thanks for having me! https://t.co/CmdBg9bQNT Last evening I headed over to Chambers’ Apothecary, an outstanding family owned pharmacy that has multiple locations and employs around 100 people. There’s much we can do in Congress to support these types of small businesses. https://t.co/akMGZmTQqL Great visit to Penn State Mont Alto to learn what we can do in Washington to support their tremendous nursing, physical therapy and occupational therapy programs. https://t.co/LhFm0sw5XR Today I voted to guarantee back pay to federal employees who are bearing the burden of this shutdown. Many of them will miss their first paycheck today because Democrats refuse to negotiate. I am fighting to reopen the government and will decline my salary until that happens. To my colleagues across the aisle who supported wall funding in the past – what changed? 

Are you really willing to reverse a previous position and keep government closed just so you can resist the President’s agenda?

It’s time to fund the wall and bring an end to the shutdown. https://t.co/ylQshwlZAJ I gave my first address on the floor of the House today, where I called for Democrats take up an appropriations package that will fund the border wall and bring an end to the government shutdown so federal workers like corrections officers at FCI Loretto can be paid. https://t.co/G3xa6h971B Democrats supported border security funding in the past. What changed? They need to come to the table so we can open the government. Take a listen to my discussion on the shutdown with @Newstalk1037fm here → https://t.co/w1RZsRKwqM Tonight, House Democrats voted to revive Obamacare. As a physician, I know from experience how the Affordable Care Act has failed to put the patient first. It's time to replace it once and for all.
