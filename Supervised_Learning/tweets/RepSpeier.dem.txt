#Whitaker’s performance today was clearly an audition for a promotion — from @POTUS’s errand boy to full-fledged lackey. RT @waltshaub: 1/ THREAD: Lost in the noise this week was the introduction of an important bill by @RepSpeier. The bill is called the Resto… Saddened to hear of the passing of John Dingell - a political giant whose biting wit made him a Twitter rockstar &amp; strength of character made him a master of compromise. His impact on Congress started in childhood, added to his dad’s legacy &amp; continues w/his wife Rep @DebDingell Introduced the RIGHT Act to address unprecedented levels of unethical behavior, nepotism and misconduct in the Executive Branch that pose a clear and present danger to not only our electoral systems but the foundation of our democracy. Read all about it: https://t.co/HbQTWRubgZ Today I reintroduced the bipartisan REPAY Act w/ @RepMarkMeadows, @RepTedLieu, and others. The bill would prevent wealthy Gulf nations from free-loading off US taxpayers when they buy our weapons. We should really ban sales to Saudi Arabia, but could at least NOT subsidize them. .@POTUS hiring a former Fox News correspondent to head the State Dept counter-propaganda program to combat “Russian disinformation, terrorist group messaging, and Chinese propaganda” sounds a lot like that old adage about guarding the hen house. It’s on the tip of my tongue. https://t.co/0kNVgEWntC And @SenGillibrand has introduced a companion bill in the US Senate. You can read more about my House bill here: https://t.co/gFFYCDxAw0 .@POTUS can't silence or ignore our 1000s of brave #transgender servicemembers willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. That's why I introduced H.R. 1032, to reverse the President’s discriminatory #TransMilitaryBan so that trans troops can join and serve openly. https://t.co/aOOUfRsEFj RT @NewDay: Coming up on #NewDay: @RepSpeier @SenatorDurbin @thelauracoates @JenSaidIt @JohnAvlon @jasoncarrollcnn @ToluseO @sbg1 @jmartNYT… RT @hardball: "There's no question it was a veiled threat." @RepSpeier on Trump taking a swipe at the Russia investigation. #Hardball Last night @POTUS said “You weren’t supposed to do that.” Well we did!

There is no humanitarian crisis at the border; just in the President’s imagination. Virtually no suspected terrorists have been seized along the border. .@POTUS would have to seize private lands to build his “wall” or whatever he’s calling it these days. 700 miles of “wall” already exists Here are a few more items to add to the list:
Border apprehensions and arrests are at near all-time lows. Bravo @MSNBC for providing the facts in the face of @POTUS’s fiction. https://t.co/Ig379o7Dkl I cosponsored the bill in CA making it the first state to pass paid leave in 2002.

This report also shows our future leaders aren’t being prepared to help stamp out sexual assault in our armed forces but will in fact perpetuate and worsen this scourge. Our service academies must lead the charge in protecting the dignity and respect of young men and women. Attempts to address sexual assault in our academies have not only failed, they've allowed rates to jump a staggering 47%. A record 15.8% of women &amp; 2.4% of men experienced unwanted sexual contact in the past year. 1/2 the women cadets/midshipmen reported being sexually harassed. We expect military service academies attract the best &amp; brightest but this report suggests academic/athletic success does not equate to instilling respect &amp; honor, hallmarks of American military service. Alarm bells should be going off everywhere. https://t.co/80BHoSoJ6M We must stop the instutionalization of gender wage discrimination that causes women to loose over $400K on average over the course of their careers, and even more for women of color.

“We don’t have… We all know what the state of our union is. We don’t need @POTUS to tell us what it is. What we need is for him to grow a spine, stop pandering to right-wing media shills, and open up the government. After @stevenmnuchin1 waived sanctions for Deripaska, shares of Rusal rose by 124%! With a boost like that, everyone’s going to want US sanctions. https://t.co/88i4c5hkA1 .@POTUS has never been bound by truth, so it makes sense that he sees KJU as a kindred spirit. But you’d think 19 undisclosed missile sites would be enough to make even him think twice about rushing into another Public Relations stunt with NK. He's got to have a redline somewhere Banning #trans individuals from joining the military &amp; serving openly/proudly is unconstitutional. The ban's only purpose is to prop up @POTUS’s fabricated crisis. Holding a hearing to get to the bottom of the Admin's propagandized study &amp; introducing leg to fix this injustice. @POTUS spent 2 minutes at the #MLK memorial today. How about serving federal workers at a soup kitchen during this national day of service? “I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.” #MLKJrDay https://t.co/y4xShHLsil To equate the legacy of one of America’s finest statesmen and champions of civil rights with a vanity project built on racist ideology and hatred is beyond disgraceful. @VP owes the American people, and the memory of Dr. King, an immediate and profuse apology. @POTUS is no MLK! Mr. President: Stop negotiating with yourself. You are causing great harm to our union. Federal employees are pawns in your chess game. You will be checkmated, guaranteed. Federal employees with children are losing their childcare slots because they can’t afford to pay childcare while they aren’t being paid. EPA workers working in wildfire and hurricane disaster areas have to pay for their housing and transportation and can’t get reimbursed because their agency is not funded. One federal employee pointed out that people will no longer want to become federal employees, eroding talent in public service. One contractor said she can’t pay rent, is not taking medications, won’t see a doctor, is running up her credit card debt. So far, contractors aren’t guaranteed reimbursement. She said she will live in her car within weeks. One employee said landlords will no longer want to rent to federal workers because they are a financial risk as shutdowns become more frequent. One EPA employee is using government credit cards issued in her name but can’t get reimbursed because her agency is shut down. It’s ruining her credit score and that could be cause to get fired. One IRS employee was ordered back to work without pay and couldn't afford the bus ticket. Listened to furloughed federal employees and contractors this afternoon. The humanitarian crisis is right here in the USA, not just at the border.@POTUS, end the #Shutdown! https://t.co/hLxEZjnd0w .@POTUS thinks everything belongs to him.

Dear @AnnCoulter -- Please tell the President it's OK to open up the government. 6. Buenos Aires, December 2018.  Informal conversations at dinner and a brief meeting. 5. Paris, November 2018. "Brief greetings" at WWI armistice anniversary. 4. Helsinki, July 2018. Two hour meeting with Trump and Putin. Each had an interpreter present. At the press conference afterward Trump said he “didn’t see any reason” to disbelieve Putin’s claims about the 2016 election. 3. Vietnam, November, 2017.  Trump and Putin had brief sidebars at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. 2. Hamburg Banquet, July 2017.  Trump, Putin and a Russian interpreter talked during the dinner meeting. 1. Hamburg, July 2017. Rex Tillerson was present for the  meeting. Interpreter told reporters that Trump responded to Putin’s denials about 2016 interference by saying “I believe you.”  After this meeting Trump took possession of the interpreter’s notes. What's been said at the unsupervised #TrumpPutin Meetings? If it was up to @POTUS we would never know! Bravo to the Virginia Senate, which just voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Now it’s on to the State Assembly and the annals of history! We’re just one state shy of what we need to pass the #ERANow! The #TrumpShutdown is flooding public lands w/ feces &amp; trash, risks housing for seniors &amp; those w/disabilities &amp; we lose food stamps on 3/1. We are facing a humanitarian crisis, &amp; not just at our border, because @POTUS views the shutdown as some kind of trophy or John Wayne win. .@POTUS’s AG nominee said whistleblower protections pose a threat to “the liberties of the American people.” And by people he meant parasitic contractors who rip off the fed gov with $640 toilets and $400 hammers. Whistleblowes are brave Americans who see fraud and call it out! Deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Carol Channing, a dear friend and one of the Grand Dames of American theater.

Would Congress sit idly by and do nothing if 40,000 Americans died from a viral epidemic or tainted food? No! Congress must take action to protect the American public and pass #HR8 #NeverAgain And most of these cases stem from people overstaying their visas. In FY2017, @HomelandSecurity reported 606,926 suspected overstays, or double the number of southern border apprehensions. In FY16, there were 408,870 southern border apprehensions vs 544,676 suspected overstays. .@POTUS continues to wall himself off from reality on border security with bogus claims of apprehensions at our southern border being on the rise.

Each time we fail to reject the NRA’s blood money/lies, we load the gun that’s used in the next shooting. For the kids who lost their futures, we must pass gun safety laws! https://t.co/64mzrjyacP RT @JohnDiazChron: Check this out: @RepSpeier
offers vivid details of @realdonaldtrump financial entanglements with Russia. In @sfchronicle… It’s w/a heavy heart that I recognize the life &amp; spirit of Justice William Newsom. I was lucky to know Bill, a passionate Dem, environmentalist &amp; Irish rogue. He was beloved by many. My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/Governor-elect Gavin Newsom,  Hillary Newsom Callan &amp; their families. How can the "great deal maker" negotiate with Congress if he is playing golf in Florida? I guess a CODEL will be necessary. Stay at Camp David @POTUS and stop lining your pockets with taxpayers' money at Mar-a-Lago. I get it, @POTUS is the Grinch that stole Christmas for seniors and the disabled as he golfs at Mar-a-Lago for 16 sun-filled days. And he calls Tillerson lazy? BREAKING: Trump plans 16-day holiday visit to Mar-a-Lago https://t.co/rJreWeME2B Today we passed by unanimous consent the CAA Reform Act to hold Members of Congress personally liable for sexual harassment &amp; retaliation. This is how Congress is supposed to work - across the aisle to get the job done! ⁦@GreggHarper⁩ ⁦@RepBrady⁩ ⁦@RepByrne⁩ https://t.co/DtReaBuTFi Proud to join @HouseDemocrats &amp; @HouseGOP in passing a UC to hold Members financially responsible for sexual harassment and retaliation. This is a historic moment, &amp; we’ll make history again next year when we expand it to include discrimination! We won’t go back! #metoo #timesup .@POTUS, try spending the $1.6B you already HAVE before throwing a tantrum on TV over a "wall" that divides your party &amp; doesn’t reflect real security needs. Forcing a #ShutDown over funds not being spent at the rate Congress appropriates isn't just reckless, it's deranged. Talking to @hardball @HardballChris about the year ahead for @POTUS and the boulders that the Dem-led House Intel Committee will be turning over, including the search for evidence of money laundering/illegal activities with the Trump properties in SoHo, Toronto and Panama. Ds &amp; Rs made history today w/an agreement to finally hold Members personally liable for harassment &amp; retaliation. And we’re not done! Next year we will pass legislation to require financial responsibility for discrimination claims. B/c we aren’t going back! #MeToo #MeTooCongress .@NatEnquirer admits it cut a $150,000 payout in “concert with” the Trump campaign “to ensure the woman did not publicize damaging allegations … before the 2016 presidential election.” @POTUS - collusion may not be a crime but conspiracy &amp; campaign fund violations are felonies. Talking to the #AGU100 panel on the rampant problem of sexual harassment in the sciences and my bill to hold academics who prey on students and staff responsible for their vile actions. Too many bright minds have been driven away from the #STEM fields. This must stop! https://t.co/O2w5Kk9Js1 .@POTUS’s assault on our planet continues. First, U.S. officials lobby for fossil fuels at UN climate talks. Then @EPA drops their new #DirtyWaterRule, exposing millions to the risk of drinking polluted H2O. The world is on fire &amp; the President is spraying it with lighter fluid. Today's #SCOTUS ruling means women in KS &amp; LA can access critical healthcare, including breast exams, paps &amp; STI tests from providers of their choice. TY @PPFA for making sure a woman's right to healthcare is not defined by income, insurance, or zip code! https://t.co/bFFRa8VxcY Congratulations Armenia on your free elections. My heart is filled w/pride seeing the progress made since Armenia’s Velvet Revolution. I look forward to working with PM Pashinyan &amp; the Armenian people as you continue to build your democracy &amp; we strengthen our nations’ ties. #ICYMI I spoke w/ @brikeilarcnn about Special Counsel Mueller questioning John Kelly about an obstruction investigation into @POTUS's attempt to fire Mueller and many other aspects of the #TrumpRussia investigations. https://t.co/wfb6O3KDU6 via Trump Plans Major Rollback of Sage Grouse Protections to Spur Oil Exploration  https://t.co/MTCQr7ebTS First @HouseGOP militarized and weaponized the lesser prairie chicken under the guise of "national security." Now the mask is finally off and we can see what it’s really about. "Drill baby, drill!" https://t.co/6qn32y5zOk Trump in 2016: “The mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth?” Trump today: “Nice to know that some people still have 'guts!'" What’s changed @POTUS? .@POTUS campaigned on a promise that America was “going to lead the way” in the #AIDS fight, but the WH proposed a $1 BILLION cut to the global AIDS response. This #WorldAIDSDay, let's send the Administration a clear message - #EnoughisEnough! We can’t rest until we find a cure! President George H.W. Bush was a true American hero and leader. He understood government from its roots—congressman, CIA director, VP and President. He never allowed politics to trump country. The Trump team planned to pay Putin back with the $50 million penthouse in Trump Tower Moscow. This is neither “very legal” nor “very cool.” It’s a crime and it’s called bribery. https://t.co/1XJLZRqXPd via @a_cormier_ Mr. President, you need to remove Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General immediately! We can’t have America’s Top Cop promoting a pyramid scheme that made him rich at the expense of unwitting inventors.  https://t.co/RT5Bm2WPP9 Talking to ⁦@ChrisJansing⁩ ⁦@MSNBC⁩ about House Intel Committee’s plans to finish #TrumpRussia investigation in the new Congress. https://t.co/I2Gx0EdKjQ "Fires, floods, and natural disasters prove #climatechange is real and we must take radical action NOW to become carbon neutral in the next 10 years. Ready to work with @Ocasio2018 on a #GreenNewDeal." https://t.co/V8uDroK8hR @RepDavidValadao has been a hero in dealing with this issue and I'm proud to have him as a partner on this. https://t.co/G5nkyr3Z7s @RepDavidValadao has been a hero in dealing with this issue and I'm proud to have him as a partner on this issue. #UXO https://t.co/lpMUaqITJh It's shameful that it's taken us so long to clean up the messes we've made. I'm proud to kick off the UXO Caucus to bring attention to this important issue. #UXO https://t.co/lELqLubiA3 STARTING NOW: @RepDavidValadao and I are joining our colleagues from both sides of the aisle to launch the new bipartisan Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)/Demining Caucus to address the human rights crisis caused by abandoned battlefields worldwide. Watch live at https://t.co/WDNHosXUmC IN 1 HOUR: Joining @RepDavidValadao and our colleagues from both sides of the aisle in launching the bipartisan Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)/Demining Caucus to address the human rights crisis caused by abandoned battlefields worldwide. Watch live: https://t.co/WDNHosXUmC Proud to send a letter with my colleagues @RepLoisFrankel @RepLawrence @RepAnnieKuster and 76 other Members demanding that @BetsyDeVosED withdraw her new proposed rule for Title IX. We will not tolerate a system that shames and blames victims. https://t.co/lxXvVxXfNH Cohen just committed THE cardinal sin in Trump’s world – telling the truth. The presidential pardon is now surely off the table. .@Schweppes &amp; @Ogilvy helped men in Brazil see firsthand the gauntlet of groping that women run in pubic places. Let's bring these dresses to Capitol Hill so @SenMajLdr will see why Congress must reform its harassment &amp; discrimination policies NOW! #MeToo https://t.co/G4G1SkSqa8 .@POTUS, go back to the drawing board. You can't appoint someone to @USDA's Office of Civil Rights who calls sexual harassment "silliness," has a history of racial discrimination &amp; has already FAILED to protect civil rights at USDA, EEOC &amp; NIH. No more foxes guarding hen house! Check out my Facebook page TOMORROW from 5-7 p.m. ET for a live stream of the launch of the bipartisan Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)/Demining Caucus. Proud to work w/@RepDavidValadao &amp; colleagues from both sides of the aisle on this human rights issue. Go to: https://t.co/WDNHotfvLc George Moscone's &amp; Harvey Milk's legacy of fighting for equal rights &amp; human dignity is more important than ever due to @POTUS' attacks on our #LGBTQ communities. On this 40th anniversary of their murders, let's honor that legacy by fighting for the America they envisioned! https://t.co/kG5tC4Ay5C It's hard to understand the sheer audacity required for someone to cut a deal to be fulsome in their testimony and to tell the truth, and then continue to lie. The Special Counsel isn't a sucker and justice isn't blind in this case. Manafort met with Assange while working for Trump in 2016, MONTHS before the first Wikileaks release of DNC emails. If it looks like collusion, meets like collusion, and acts like collusion, then it probably is collusion. Proud to join @RepDavidValadao in forming a bipartisan caucus to support the removal of ordnance, mines &amp; other explosives left behind on battlefields. War leaves permanent wounds that we must mitigate for the safety of civilians &amp; future generations. https://t.co/6Zf6KF7RYB Excited to talk with 120 students at Mission Dolores Academy. Impressed how much they know about turning bills into laws, great testament to teaching civics! https://t.co/KZDzLn8m32 It’s beyond disgusting for @POTUS to release a statement so trite and full of lies. Open source reports and our allies’ actions have told us what we need to know about Khashoggi’s murder. Only someone so compromised would bury his head this deep in the Saudi sand. RT @MattGrantFOX46: A dying North Carolina Green Beret's story prompts some members of Congress to call for a hearing, law change, after FO… Based on @POTUS’s obsession with getting media and the rave reviews this turkey has seen today, we could be looking at the next White House Press Secretary. https://t.co/cDZRP2M2VU Working w/ @SenWarren @BetoORourke to get to the bottom of why @POTUS deployed more than 5,000 military servicemembers to the southwest border for what Pentagon officials have called "an expensive waste of time and resources and a morale killer to boot." https://t.co/MMouxfPg3u https://t.co/nFH9CY8wmB
