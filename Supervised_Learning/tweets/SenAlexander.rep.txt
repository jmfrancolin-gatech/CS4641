The U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works just approved John Ryder to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors. John would be a valuable addition to the @TVAnews Board. https://t.co/bqCpUYjrTp Today, I am interested in hearing more about specific recommendations to improve access to affordable primary care. And, employers are increasingly taking an active role in their employees’ health and in the cost of health care, like employing a doctor on-site so employees don’t have to take time off of work to see a primary care doctor. There are other ways to lower health care costs through expanded access to primary care. Another is community health centers, which we talked about at our last hearing and that are where 27 million Americans go for their primary care. And, while the data may be incomprehensible today, it is a ripe opportunity for innovation from private companies to arrange the data so primary care doctors can help their patients can have better outcomes and better experiences at lower costs. I believe we can empower primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants to go even a step further. At our 4th hearing, we heard about how patients have no idea how much a particular treatment or test will end up costing. Dr. Adam Boehler, who leads the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, recently told me that primary care is only 3-7 percent of health care spending, but affects as much as half of all health care spending. Dr. Gross’ practice is one of about a thousand similar clinics in the United States and is a good example of how a primary care doctor can help reduce costs. In 2010, Dr. Gross created one of the first Direct Primary Care practices. Instead of working with insurance companies and government programs, Dr. Gross’ patients pay him a flat monthly fee directly. .@drleegross, of Florida, testified last year at this committee’s fifth hearing on the cost of health care that too many government mandates and insurance companies were getting between doctors and patients and making primary care more expensive than it needed to be.

Watch live here: https://t.co/fDnOzu804q #MakingCollegeWorthIt #HigherEd It is our responsibility to take whatever steps we can to help students afford college and make sure that the degrees they earn are worth the time and money they pay for them. #MakingCollegeWorthIt https://t.co/vwhLbGluFE In my conversations with Democrat and Republican senators, I have found a remarkable degree of bipartisan consensus about the directions we should take to make college affordable and make students’ degrees worth their time and money. This year, I have met with Ranking Democrat Senator @PattyMurray and nine other committee members to discuss compiling these ideas into a single piece of legislation. During the last four years, the Senate education committee has held 27 hearings on the Higher Education Act.  These hearings have resulted in a number of bipartisan proposals that make college more affordable and worth students’ time and money. Third, I am proposing a new accountability system based upon whether borrowers are actually repaying their student loans. This should lower tuition for some programs, or even discourage schools from offering programs that are not worth it to students. This plan makes sure if there was no money earned, there would be no money owed, and that would not reflect negatively on a borrower’s credit. The other option would be a 10-year payment plan, with equal monthly payments, similar to a 10-year mortgage. The option I believe most borrowers would choose is a repayment plan based on a borrower’s income, which would never require the borrower to make payments of more than ten percent of his or her discretionary income. Second, a new way to repay student loans: We should scrap the current system of nine different ways to repay federal student loans. It should be replaced with two options, both of which would automatically deduct payments from your paycheck. First, simplify the #FAFSA: We can cut the dreaded Free Application for Federal Student Aid from 108 questions to no more than two dozen. Today, I have three proposals to help make the answer to all four of those questions YES. And from administrators as well—can’t you do something about the jungle of red tape that makes it so hard to apply for federal financial aid, to pay back student loans and that wastes money on overhead that could instead be spent on students? The questions I hear most often about college are: Can I afford it? Is it worth it? And can you make applying for financial aid and repaying student loans simpler? The U.S. has most of the best colleges in the world, but also the most graduates paying off college debt. Roughly 40 million borrowers owe $1.5 trillion in collective student loan debt. A college graduate paying more than $1000 per month on student loans recently wrote, “I was told to chase down a bachelor’s degree by any means necessary. But no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be.” Getting ready to speak at @AEI, where I’ll be announcing three proposals for updating the Higher Education Act.

Since 1958, his cartoons were the first thing I looked for in the Knoxville newspapers. Watch live here: https://t.co/sFPQQOg7mh Two weeks ago, Senator @PattyMurray and I took the first step by introducing legislation that will extend funding for community health centers for five years at $4 billion a year in mandatory funding. In Fiscal Year 2019, these centers received $4 billion in mandatory funding and $1.6 billion in discretionary funding. Congress has to act by the end of September to make sure community health centers continue to receive this federal funding and keep their doors open. Community health centers have also been an important part of combating the opioid crisis that has impacted virtually every community across the country. #OpioidCrisisResponse There are about 1,400 federally-funded health centers that provide outpatient care to approximately 27 million people, including 400,000 Tennesseans, at about 12,000 sites across the United States. Because the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional is a community health center, they charge patients based on a sliding scale which means more people have access to and can afford health care close to home. The old hospital building was turned into the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional, a community health center which operates as something between a clinic and full hospital. Lewis Health Center estimates they can deal with about 90 percent of patients that walk in the door. For example, in Tennessee, after Lewis County’s only hospital closed, the closest emergency room for its 12,000 residents was 30 minutes away. Community health centers actually fit into a larger topic of great interest to this committee – primary care. Today, we are talking about the community health centers where 27 million Americans receive their primary care and other services. Today’s topic is extending federal funding for community health centers, as well as four other federal health programs, which are all set to expire at the end of September. I will be working on these priorities with Ranking Member @PattyMurray, with members of the HELP Committee, and other senators interested reaching a result on lowering health care costs and updating the Higher Education Act. This is the first hearing of the new Congress so let me take a few minutes to talk about what we hope to accomplishment these next two years. Number one, reducing health care costs. And number two, making sure a college degree is worth students’ time and money.

John is a good man and is the right person to help keep TVA on a good path. https://t.co/l0ZRXA1uNh I am opposed to this partial government shutdown, and I am doing everything I can to reopen the government. Some Tennessee bankers are helping dedicated government workers who need assistance in the meantime.

We have a lot of important work ahead of us this Congress, and I am confident Senators Enzi, Isakson, and Paul will deliver results on behalf of families across our country. .@SenatorEnzi will lead the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security. @SenatorIsakson will lead the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. And, @RandPaul will lead the Subcommittee on Children and Families. Congratulations to @SenatorEnzi, @SenatorIsakson and @RandPaul who were all named chairmen of the Senate HELP Committee’s three subcommittees for the 116th Congress. https://t.co/diare9VlEh Nuclear power must be part of our energy future if we want a future with clean, cheap, and reliable energy that can create good jobs and keep America competitive in a global economy. https://t.co/aMjQfVflmA .@MarshaBlackburn and I introduced a bill to expand the Shiloh National Military Park in Shiloh, which will help attract more visitors to Tennessee, boost local economies and protect the site for future generations. https://t.co/HEzt7Q5a3l It’s wrong for federal employees to work and not get a paycheck. That’s why I’m glad to cosponsor @SenRonJohnson’s Pay Expected Personnel Act, legislation to ensure the over 400,000 federal employees who are required to work during the shutdown can receive their paycheck. https://t.co/zdSvGIsajX Today, I chaired the first Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development hearing of the 116th Congress. We discussed the future of nuclear power and advanced reactors. https://t.co/zPHLwPlsDN It is hard to imagine Blount County without Dean Stone, and that’s why @MarshaBlackburn and I introduced legislation to name a bridge on the Foothills Parkway as the Dean Stone Bridge. https://t.co/Hdb5WsJhvD HAPPENING NOW https://t.co/SzY7kKvG0d I’m about to chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development to discuss the future of nuclear power and advanced reactors. You can watch live here: https://t.co/eejUNrMzSg https://t.co/XsU3SQVuL3 Good to hear @Tusculum_Univ was awarded a $150K grant from @ARCgov to improve STEM education in East TN. Tusculum has plenty that is unique to celebrate, with this grant and the arrival of a new president, they can continue to build on the success the university has already had. Today @MarshaBlackburn and I introduced legislation that would take the next step to protect and preserve President James K. Polk’s home in Columbia, Tennessee. https://t.co/sDwIO24QdN TUNE IN at 2:30 PM ET today — I’ll be chairing an appropriations subcommittee hearing to discuss the future of nuclear power and advanced reactors. 

You can watch live here: https://t.co/eejUNrMzSg I am glad to hear researchers are already exploring new, targeted cancer drugs for children, and I look forward to continuing to make sure the law works as we intended. I was happy to work with @marcorubio, @PattyMurray and @SenatorBennet to include the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act in the FDA reauthorization act of 2017. Via the @WSJ: https://t.co/IuSS9ylDxF Thanks to @BetsyDeVosED, filling out your @FAFSA is easier than ever. Download the FAFSA app – which makes applying for federal aid as easy as booking an airline ticket! https://t.co/TSeF3CLlgf Jed DeKalb started working for the state when I was governor. He has a wonderful, artistic eye &amp; tremendous work ethic. He has made enormous contributions to record an important 40 yrs of TN history. Congratulations on your retirement, Jed! Via @Tennessean https://t.co/YAHKdBtWDe TUNE IN at 7:45 AM CT to @600WREC for my conversation with @MyTimVanHorn. I am opposed to this partial government shutdown, and we will discuss my ideas about how to re-open the government quickly.

Listen live here: https://t.co/KrwhmQxMU5 The @USOPM also is a good resource during the partial government shutdown. Here is a link to its page for more guidance for furloughed employees: https://t.co/cZpRV68M3y Some local credit unions are providing loans to help government employees not receiving paychecks make ends meet until the government is reopened. I am opposed to this partial government shutdown, and I am doing everything I can to reopen the government. For all the dedicated government workers who need assistance in the meantime, you may be able to take advantage of help from credit unions. Congratulations to Governor @BillHaslam on this exciting announcement for our state. https://t.co/ye1f8kBlCo Tennessee’s workforce, central location, our right-to-work law, our top-notch roads, and our state leadership have all contributed to Tennessee’s ability to create and expand good paying automotive jobs. I've thought for a while that the TVA region could be a national leader in manufacturing electric cars. Today’s announcement by @VW that it has selected Chattanooga as its first North American manufacturing facility for electric vehicle production will create 1,000 new, good-paying jobs for Tennesseans and is yet another success story for our state’s auto industry. I’m very grateful to Governor @BillHaslam for his thoughtfulness. Via @WJHL11 https://t.co/h6YrGkeb9y That’s why I’m glad to cosponsor the Pay Expected Personnel Act, legislation to ensure the over 400,000 federal employees who are required to work during the shutdown can receive their paycheck. https://t.co/5dU7oLjykP It’s wrong for federal employees to work and not get a paycheck. I want you to know that I’m doing everything I can to reopen the government. I have known Mark for many years – since I was the governor of Tennessee, and I know he will be a great asset to the federal bench. Mark is respected by his peers around the country, having been elected chairman of the Council of State Governments, and has been a champion for federalism and for the separation of powers. Today, I attended the investiture of Mark Norris as U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee in Memphis. I recommended Mark to @POTUS, and I strongly supported his nomination. https://t.co/ujoLcoEV3v Want to learn more about what I’m working on in the U.S. Senate for Tennesseans? 

Subscribe to my weekly newsletter: https://t.co/pxNB3HYV1l https://t.co/NWgp8osftR Good to sit down with a few folks from the @dailymemphian and talk about how to secure our border, end the partial government shutdown, and many other important issues that affect Memphians every day. https://t.co/UP1uNwiSUN I’m grateful to Cato Johnson and @MethodistHlth for getting together business and community leaders in Memphis this morning. I enjoyed our discussion about what I’m working on in Washington for Memphians. https://t.co/UJ3uNNQ2Iw I’m grateful for all the work the @FarmBureau has done over the last 100 years to help farmers in Tennessee – and across the country – succeed. Agriculture is one of Tennessee’s most important industries. Our state is home to 340,000 farmers and more than 66,000 farms that contribute tens of billions of dollars each year to our economy. I am glad to cosponsor a resolution in the United States Senate to recognize the @FarmBureau on its 100th anniversary. Congratulations to Sen. @LisaMurkowski on being elected chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I serve on, for the 116th Congress.
