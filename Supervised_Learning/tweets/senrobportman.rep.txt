My End Government Shutdowns Act, which is gaining momentum w/ 33 cosponsors in the #Senate, will permanently end unnecessary &amp; costly government shutdowns in the future. Gov’t shutdowns only hurt federal workers, their families, and taxpayers. https://t.co/JhOA14n8sP I’ll continue working w/ Senators on both sides of the aisle and the Trump Admin to deliver results for #OHIO. The #SOTU is an opportunity to bring our nation together, assess where we are, &amp; look to the future. Lots of topics were discussed where progress could be made, including infrastructure, health care costs, and unfair trade. I was glad to have @MayorTitoBrown as my guest for the #SOTU earlier this week. We have worked together on projects that help Youngstown over the last couple of years, including winning a Dept of Transportation BUILD grant to revitalize downtown Youngstown. Having enjoyed hunting and fishing in Ohio since I was a kid, I enjoyed giving the keynote address today at the League of Ohio Sportsmen Annual Conference. #Ohio's sportsmen are committed to preserving our heritage and helping conservation efforts in Ohio and around the nation. https://t.co/t7ucPqpjoc Across #Ohio, employers large and small tell me they are searching for more skilled workers. I heard it again in Butler County Friday at a roundtable discussion with manufacturers &amp; career and technical education (CTE) students and instructors. https://t.co/UXagnWv1fL It was my honor to host a reception in #Columbus this morning to congratulate the Class of 2019 Military Service Academy nominees &amp; their families. These young men &amp; women are the best &amp; brightest from #Ohio and I’m proud of their records &amp; their commitment to serve our country. https://t.co/Do6B7bceRa There is no room in our world for hatred and anti-Semitism. I had called for the appointment of a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism and I appreciate that the Admin has appointed Elan Carr to that job at State Dept. https://t.co/cG07kMmSNZ Section 232 is a vital trade remedy for our national security but when it is misused it hurts #Ohio workers, consumers &amp; our economy. My bipartisan Trade Security Act will ensure this tool is reserved for legitimate national security threats. https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V The funeral service Friday for Clermont Co Deputy Sheriff Bill Brewer was incredibly moving.

It currently has 33 cosponsors, a bipartisan House companion bill &amp; widespread backing from the nation’s editorial boards: https://t.co/D1Hniyfhl7 I was honored to pay tribute today at Deputy Bill Brewer’s funeral service.  He was a true hero who gave the ultimate sacrifice while protecting the people of Clermont County. Good read from the #Cleveland Plain Dealer ed board on why my End Gov’t Shutdowns bill is needed right now. We now have 33 cosponsors &amp; I continue to work to build support for this common-sense fix. https://t.co/SLDL09XXdr I had the chance to get to know John Dingell when I served in the House. Big John was a legendary figure in the history of the Congress, and it was an honor to call him my friend. Jane &amp; I are sending our love and prayers to Debbie and the entire Dingell family. Was honored to meet Frank Robinson and his wonderful wife and daughter in his final role as manager with the #Nats. A true gentleman, a baseball hero of mine as a kid in #Cincinnati, and an All Star who broke so many barriers. RIP to a true great: Frank Robinson. A #Cincinnati @Reds hero. MLB’s first African-American manager w/ the #Cleveland @Indians. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Honor. He was a true civil rights pioneer on &amp; off the field. He'll be greatly missed. https://t.co/mle0E5GSCx Great to be on @Varneyco this morning to talk about my support for @POTUS’ border security proposal, which funds the top 10 priorities laid out by gov’t border security experts. https://t.co/kgmejyICNo The Section 232 law is a vital trade remedy but when misused it can hurt our workers &amp; our economy.

I encourage all interested students to attend one of the 17 service academy seminars I co-host w/ @SenSherrodBrown https://t.co/kgmejyICNo Great discussion and smart questions on immigration, border security, E-Verify, the economy, prescription drug prices, infrastructure &amp; more tonight on our tele townhall with constituents from central #Ohio. https://t.co/zFNR1Vm0Xj Thanks for coming in today, Aaron! I enjoyed the opportunity to catch up. https://t.co/DcHMPRTIsB I’ve repeatedly expressed concerns about misuse of Section 232 to impose tariffs on autos &amp; auto parts &amp; its impact on #Ohio #jobs &amp; economy as whole. I urge my colleagues to pass my bipartisan Trade Security Act to ensure this trade tool is used properly https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V My bipartisan Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 to preserve this trade remedy tool while ensuring that the Department of Defense justifies the national security basis for any new tariffs under this law. https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable, but we must do so in a way that protects American #jobs and strengthens our economy.  That’s why I introduced my bipartisan Trade Security Act today.  https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V Introduced bipartisan legislation today w/ @SenDougJones @SenJoniErnst @SenAlexander @SenFeinstein @SenatorFischer @SenatorSinema &amp; @SenToddYoung to reform our national security tariff process #jobs https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V Great to meet with these #Ohio young people &amp; hear their ideas about to help prevent teen drug use.

There is growing support for my legislation, which now has 33 cosponsors. Read more about it here in my op-ed for @CNN: https://t.co/dHn6x825ME On Bloomberg this morning I discussed @POTUS' remarks at the #SOTU last night, including #trade relations w/ #China &amp; misuse of Section 232. Also highlighted my End Government Shutdowns Act, which is gaining momentum w/ 33 cosponsors in the #Senate. https://t.co/Erkjqg16UN Incredible shot of F-16 Falcons from #Ohio’s 180th Fighter Wing ANG.

I enjoyed meeting with everyone and discussing my End Government Shutdowns Act, enhancing border security, modernizing our trade laws, #taxreform &amp; more. #Ohio https://t.co/lDxzBg7OWm Hundreds of birds migrate through #Ohio each year, making it one of the top destinations for birding. Protecting &amp; preserving these bird populations is critically important and I’m proud of my work with @SenatorCardin on this important bipartisan legislation. https://t.co/xYRSatsrx2 Many Dems also say new barriers should be based on expert advice on the placement and the type of structure. That’s what @POTUS’ plan does. #SOTU An agreement is totally within reach with both @POTUS &amp; Democrats now agreeing that southern border needs more agents, more technology &amp; drones, more humanitarian assistance, more immigration judges &amp; better screening at ports of entry to stop the flow of drugs. that is drawn up by gov’t experts, and embraced by the last two annual congressional spending bills on a bipartisan basis. Good that @POTUS outlined a comprehensive plan to strengthen border security, but I wish he would emphasize that the new barriers are based on the top 10 priorities of the Border Security Improvement Plan... .@POTUS rightly highlighted the economic progress we’re making and the role of #taxreform. 304K new #jobs last month &amp; strongest wage growth since the Great Recession. Real progress but we must continue our work to ensure opportunity for all Americans. #SOTU #Ohio Agree with @POTUS’ call for unity tonight, especially his message that we should “govern not as two parties but as one nation.” I’m committed to working with all my colleagues to continue delivering results for #Ohio &amp; our country. #SOTU #Ohio I was proud to support bipartisan legislation today that will strengthen America’s partnerships w/ crucial allies in the Middle East, support our ally #Israel &amp; hold the brutal Assad regime in #Syria accountable. https://t.co/AqT1kpbNZg I’m honored to have #Youngstown @MayorTitoBrown as my guest tonight at the State of the Union and look forward to hearing @POTUS’ remarks. #SOTU https://t.co/9XAnTl8n1X It is time to end government shutdowns for good and my legislation to accomplish this goal already has 33 cosponsors in the #Senate. #SOTU https://t.co/NNPa8EaY7g At #SOTU, @POTUS should discuss his responsible plan to strengthen our security on the southern border, which is backed by government experts. https://t.co/NNPa8EaY7g Look forward to hearing from @POTUS about his plans to rebuild our infrastructure, improve #job training programs, tackle unfair trade w/ #China, and address high prescription drug prices. #SOTU https://t.co/NNPa8EaY7g Over the past 2yrs, I’ve worked w/ the admin &amp; my Senate colleagues to deliver results for #Ohio &amp; our country in combating online sex trafficking (#SESTA) &amp; the #opioidcrisis (#STOPAct) but there's still work to be done. #SOTU https://t.co/NNPa8DTmIG The State of the Union is an opportunity each year to bring our nation together, assess where we are &amp; look to the future.

Mayor Brown has done an incredible job for the community in #Youngstown &amp; I look forward to continuing my work with him to move #Youngstown and #Ohio forward. https://t.co/GAqFyMznv0 I met Ashley in May 2018 when I toured Brigid’s Path to discuss how my #CRIBAct, now law, would help her and her newborn born dependent on drugs recover.

It already has bipartisan support in the House &amp; my hope is that we can get this important legislation included in the final spending package. https://t.co/JhOA14n8sP My bill improves E-Verify and makes sure all employers are using it. https://t.co/ExvPJj4Xja E-Verify should provide a simple &amp;  reliable way for employers to confirm whether a new employee is here legally. Unfortunately the current optional program fails to eliminate the #job magnet and allows too many people to use fraudulent documents. Great Q&amp;A w/ Senator @ChuckGrassley on the importance of passing my End Government Shutdowns Act. I’m thankful for his support &amp; the support of the 30 other Senators who agree, the time is now to end government shutdowns. https://t.co/hGaqVMS0I8 I’m committed to working w/ colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to continue our progress over the next 2 yrs.

Find out why my bill has garnered so much support: https://t.co/fN0oCtQYwS I want to thank Sen. @ChuckGrassley for selecting me to lead a key Finance Subcommittee focused on pensions &amp; retirement security policy. I’m excited to continue my work on these issues &amp; to offer solutions that help Americans have a more secure retirement https://t.co/k1rc3TmKmr More in my op-ed for @CNN: https://t.co/YrcAjoLp4a Too often, we talk about trying to fix the problem while a gov’t shutdown is going on, but after it is over, we forget some of the pain, dislocation &amp;  inefficiency of it. Let's try something different this time. Let's end shutdowns for good. Cyber response teams play a vital role in helping federal agencies address cyber challenges &amp; disrupt cyber threats. I reintroduced a bipartisan bill w/ @SenatorHasson to permanently establish a DHS Cyber Response Team to reduce cybersecurity risks. https://t.co/l0elG2uNX9 America has just gone through the longest fed govt shutdown in history. It’s important, now more than ever, that we pass my act to end government shutdowns. On the @SenateFloor I laid out my plan to permanently prevent the federal govt from shutting down. https://t.co/JhOA14n8sP The Labor Department’s latest #jobs report yesterday shows strong job growth and wage growth which is good news for families in #Ohio and across the US who are benefitting from pro-growth policies like #taxreform &amp; regulatory relief. https://t.co/oYd8JbUy2U The @ColumbusZoo welcomed a baby dama gazelle, a critically endangered species &amp; the rarest of all gazelles, to their zoo family!

This is a perfect example of the crisis at the border &amp; why we need stronger border security in order to keep these lethal drugs out of our communities. Good economic news today: @USDOL reports that wage growth in the U.S. last year was the largest annual increase in more than 10 years. https://t.co/q7kapVlO9K #jobs #taxreform The goal of E-Verify is to provide a simple, reliable way for employers to confirm a new employee’s identity &amp; work eligibility. My act will require all employers to use E-Verify which will reduce the job magnet that remains a draw for unauthorized workers https://t.co/8cbPzaidL6 https://t.co/8cbPzaidL6 Today I introduced the E-Verify Act to require employers to use an electronic employment verification system in order to stem the tide of illegal immigration. The program is currently optional for most employers &amp; has significant limitations that my legislation will improve. The majority of Americans believe that taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects should use Made in USA materials. Today’s #BuyAmerican executive order can go farther. That’s why we must pass our Buy America bill with @SenBrown and our https://t.co/gu8IuGS7GO Act with @SenMurphy. My End Government Shutdowns Act currently has 29 cosponsors in the Senate, a bipartisan companion bill in the House &amp; we continue to see momentum behind this effort.

They only result in causing financial hardship for federal workers &amp; cost taxpayers more $$. As I say in my @CNN op-ed, it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s end shutdowns for good. https://t.co/YrcAjoLp4a Today on the @SenateFloor I urged the #Senate to end gov't shutdowns for good while the pain from our recent shutdown is still fresh.

My legislation would end them for good. https://t.co/ehaOtyoESf I’ve introduced legislation to accomplish this goal, called the End Government Shutdowns Act, that I believe should be included in the final gov’t funding bill Congress will act on in the next three weeks: https://t.co/5qNwHYeCX2 Legislation to permanently prevent the federal government from shutting down is gaining currency among members of Congress in both parties. Here’s what they are saying: https://t.co/5qNwHYeCX2 Tune in to @WKYC’s livestream of their 8th annual human trafficking forum this afternoon at 2:00 PM ET. We must all do our part to educate ourselves to the warning signs of human trafficking in order to identify &amp; report it. #EndHumanTrafficking #SESTA https://t.co/ViDDoP4Qyy I want to thank Congressman @Troy_Balderson, of #OH12, for introducing the House companion to my End Government Shutdowns Act. Shutdowns don’t work and we should end them for good as part of the final gov’t funding bill over the next few weeks. January is National Human Trafficking Prevention Month and tomorrow @WKYC will livestream their 8th annual human trafficking forum. I encourage everyone to tune in. Together we can work to #EndHumanTrafficking #SESTA https://t.co/3uy7ahUAOH Congress requires the production of thousands of reports each year but doesn’t compile them into one, central location. The federal govt should be transparent to the people it represents and my legislation will give the public access to these reports. https://t.co/GgHxyDEgy5 Good luck to all the incredible athletes participating in the 2019 #ProBowl today, especially Geno Atkins from the #Bengals and Myles Garrett, Geno Atkins, Denzel Ward, Jarvis Landry &amp; Joel Bitonio of the #Browns! #Ohio #GoAFC The 35-day shutdown is finally over. I supported the plan Friday to reopen the govt. These shutdowns must be brought to an end for good which is why I’ve introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act.  https://t.co/J5pFPUpK41 Restarting domestic uranium enrichment at the #Piketon plant is important for our national &amp; energy security.

These world-class workers deserve better for their lifetime of loyalty &amp; I will continue to fight for them.  https://t.co/6JInVacJvX The federal government should be transparent to the people it represents. That’s why I recently introduced 2 bills that will give our citizens better access to all of the studies &amp;  reports mandated by the legislative branch each year.https://t.co/GgHxyDEgy5 Over the last 2 yrs the Senate has confirmed 85 judicial nominees, including 30 circuit court judges &amp; 2 on #SCOTUS. All of this was made more difficult because of Democrats using the Senate procedures to require hours and hours of debate on even some non-controversial judges. Happy belated birthday to @CincinnatiZoo’s most lovable resident, @FionaHippo! From entering the world at only 29lbs to now topping the scales at over 1,000 lbs, you’ve shown us there’s even more to love. #TeamFiona https://t.co/sW6TSGzQzP I worked hard to help get Opportunity Zones into #taxreform b/c they will help boost job creation &amp; economic growth in #Ohio’s distressed communities. That’s why I’m urging @USTreasury to help stakeholders take advantage of OZs in #Ohio https://t.co/E3OYN85CPi https://t.co/6JInVacJvX .@GM’s decision to stop production at the #Lordstown plant has been a punch in the gut to a community that has dedicated their lives to the plant. I sat down w/ @CBSThisMorning to discuss the Lordstown’s world-class workforce &amp; the need to bring new production to the plant. Now that the government has been reopened, we should focus on preventing these types of shutdowns from ever happening again. My End Government Shutdowns Act is the right solution &amp; I will push to include it in the final government funding bill. 

https://t.co/PxsGNmVvnd I’ve said repeatedly throughout this process that government shutdowns are a bad idea &amp; introduced legislation to end government shutdowns for good. We’ve already gained 18 cosponsors for my legislation &amp; I will strongly push for its inclusion in any final government funding bill Thank you @ChuckGrassley for saying: “The final package should also end government shutdowns once and for all.” Completely agree. The End Government Shutdowns Act should be in any final funding bill. https://t.co/BInqB2aVPt The announcement today is consistent with the letter that I worked on with a group of Republicans &amp; Democrats last week that outlined a process for reopening the government in the short term with the commitment to a border security plan that can be enacted in the next few weeks https://t.co/J5pFPUHkVz I support the approach @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has outlined for a 3 week CR. For the last several weeks I’ve worked w/ colleagues on both sides to reopen the gov’t &amp; address the need for additional border security. I believe this is a fair &amp; reasonable step forward. It’s time to stop using government shutdowns as political leverage &amp; work together to solve these issues. https://t.co/k6gOfOyJlw I’m proud of the support from #Ohioans like Enid on my End Government Shutdowns Act. Government shutdowns never work &amp; end up hurting federal workers AND costing taxpayers more money. On Jan 28 at 2 PM, @WKYC will livestream their 8th annual human trafficking forum &amp; I encourage everyone to tune in. #EndHumanTrafficking #SESTA https://t.co/3uy7ahUAOH Ending human trafficking is one of my top priorities in the #Senate &amp; my #SESTA law has already made an impact in ensuring justice for victims of online sex trafficking.

For the last few weeks I’ve worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a path forward that would strengthen our border security &amp; address immigration issues like #DACA. https://t.co/Bxz58KkEwA I continue to work with my colleagues on a 3rd way that has bipartisan support &amp; I’ve advocated for weeks. It would reopen the government in the short term with the commitment to a border security plan that can be enacted in the next few weeks. https://t.co/Bxz58KkEwA Yesterday on the @SenateFloor, I urged my colleagues to support @POTUS’ plan to improve border security, address consensus issues like #DACA &amp; reopen the government. Let’s find common ground &amp; resolve this impasse now. https://t.co/EIqTXjrdEC Opportunity Zones will help boost investment &amp; #jobs in struggling communities throughout #Ohio. I joined @SenatorTimScott in urging the @USTreasury to help all stakeholders take advantage of this important tax incentive. https://t.co/7bxVfnK1x3 It’s time to move forward with a responsible resolution that will reopen government but will also ensure that we have a secure southern border. That’s what the American people want &amp; we should work w/ @POTUS to provide that. https://t.co/zunsRfYzWV Earlier today I spoke on the @SenateFloor urging my colleagues to support @POTUS proposal to secure the southern border &amp; end the government shutdown. https://t.co/zunsRfYzWV https://t.co/6JInVacJvX The decision to stop production at the #Lordstown plant has been a punch in the gut to a community &amp; especially @GM workers who have dedicated their lives to this company. @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I sat down w/ @CBSThisMorning to discuss the plant’s world-class workforce. On today’s @CBSThisMorning, @SenSherrodBrown and I discuss our support for @GM workers &amp; our work to press the company to bring new production to the #Lordstown plant.  https://t.co/6JInVacJvX Join me live on the Senate Floor as I discuss the partial federal government shutdown and President Trump's proposal to strengthen border security and reopen the government. https://t.co/heI1OMqPsO Supporting these #Ohio nominees is part of my efforts to confirm judges who will apply the law as written. Over the last 2 yrs, the Senate has confirmed 85 judicial nominees, including 30 circuit court judges who hear appeals from trial courts &amp; two on #SCOTUS. I’m pleased that @POTUS has moved swiftly to re-nominate 5 qualified #Ohioans to serve on the federal appellate &amp; trial courts in #Ohio. I look forward to supporting their nominations on the #Senate floor. #Ohio https://t.co/lUfn7MhHfY It’s important for both parties to engage in good-faith negotiations for our country. I’ve introduced legislation to strengthen border security while codifying #DACA protections, one consensus solution I believe can help resolve this #shutdown impasse https://t.co/XQFqR7zFAT https://t.co/AoZnMZzAUf This #shutdown impasse has gone on for too long. It’s time for both parties to resolve their disagreements &amp; I believe the proposal from @POTUS is a positive step forward. I will continue to work with my Republican &amp; Democrat colleagues to achieve a constructive &amp; fair result. Today we honor a man who believed that hate could never be the answer in drowning out hate. It’s important now, more than ever, that we come together as a nation to overcome the hate. #MLKDay In the inspiring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “That old law about 'an eye for an eye' leaves everybody blind. The time is always right to do the right thing” Let us remember the life &amp; legacy of a great man on #MLKDay and also recommit ourselves to being the best we can. Despite snow/ice on backroads and single digit temperatures, strong turnout at the 34th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday Breakfast in #Columbus. Proud that it’s the largest #MLK breakfast in America. https://t.co/6RJ2bqHa8X Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a man who not only had a dream, but inspired an entire nation to rise up against oppression to make that dream a reality. #MLKDay I’m pleased w/ @ENERGY’s intent to invest more than $115M over the next 3 years in the #Piketon plant to bring cutting edge new technology to #Ohio for enriched uranium for power plants, nuclear weapons arsenal, &amp; nuclear navy. All important for our energy &amp; national security. Congress requires the executive branch to produce thousands of reports each year but doesnt compile them into a central location. I believe the federal govt should be transparent to the people it represents so my bill
gives the public access to the reports https://t.co/GgHxyDmF9v January is National Slavery &amp; Human Trafficking Prevention Month. I’ll continue to lead the Senate to combat this evil crime. My bipartisan #SESTA law is working to help victims and survivors of online sex trafficking find the justice they deserve. The Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act is now law. I’m proud to have worked to include provisions that will give #Ohioan communities more flexibility in ensuring that water infrastructure is healthy &amp; safe for all #Ohioans.  https://t.co/6sYDG9H96x .@toledonews @AkronBeacon &amp; Cincinnati @Enquirer editorials have acknowledged our legislation to enhance border security + codify #DACA protections &amp; End Government Shutdowns.  https://t.co/Ef84JM3JeM The federal government has a responsibility to be transparent to the people it represents. I introduced 2 bills this week to give every citizen access to the mandated federal studies and reports.https://t.co/GgHxyDEgy5 Below is my statement following @POTUS announcement of a new plan to strengthen our border security, pass consensus reform measures like #DACA, and reopen the government: https://t.co/MT18uISvVF Today’s proposal from @POTUS is a positive step forward. I will continue my discussions with Democratic &amp; Republican colleagues this weekend to achieve a constructive result. https://t.co/4TtkgFUvtp My hope is that this new proposal will spark more good-faith negotiations so we can resolve the current impasse on border security and reopen the government. As I have said repeatedly, we are not that far apart. https://t.co/4TtkgFUvtp .@POTUS has laid out a constructive new proposal that contains the basis for a bipartisan agreement. It includes many of the same ideas I have been discussing in bipartisan talks over the past few weeks https://t.co/4TtkgFUvtp Past time for both parties to work together to resolve this #shutdown impasse.  I will continue to do my part and work w/ Senators on both sides to secure the border, pass consensus reforms like #DACA &amp; reopen the government. https://t.co/XRs6nCRcrZ If you know a high school junior  interested in the Senate Page Program my office is now accepting applications. The program provides an unique opportunity for students in #Ohio to come &amp; experience the day-to-day inner workings of the US Senate. More here https://t.co/w1gnYag3Hs Good luck to the hikers on the annual winter hike into #HockingHills in Logan, #Ohio. Thousands of hikers are signed up to witness a snowy day at one of our great state park. Don’t forget to take in #Ohio’s biggest tree &amp; largest cave!  https://t.co/Lg1NHUm9WW I’ve been working to bring both parties together &amp; reach an agreement that secures the border &amp; brings a resolution to the government #shutdown. I spoke on the @SenateFloor this week on how I believe we can achieve that: https://t.co/XRs6nCRcrZ Wonderful local effort to help federal employees in need. I’m doing everything I can to bring both parties together and resolve this #shutdown. 
https://t.co/zDM0vnhmT5 via @WCPO #Ohio The U.S. is one of only 7 nations in the world that allow abortion after 20 weeks, putting us in the company of North Korea &amp; China. This is one of the many reasons #whywemarch for life. https://t.co/bT6KUgCbln Today I introduced the Child Custody Protection Act because parents have a right to be involved in the most important decisions that their children make. This bill will strengthen state parental notification laws. https://t.co/JbEggbX5c9 #whywemarch Proud to join so many Ohioans today at the #MarchForLife. Every life is unique &amp; that is #WhyWeMarch. https://t.co/YKE4LTASSr Earlier today, I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my frustration over this #shutdown. We’re not that far apart. I highlighted my efforts to bring both parties together to strengthen our border security &amp; reopen the govt. https://t.co/XRs6nCRcrZ Join me live on the Senate floor as I discuss the ongoing partial federal government shutdown and where we stand today. https://t.co/heI1OMqPsO I believe government transparency is important which is why I introduced 2 bills that will give our citizens better access to all of the studies and reports mandated by the legislative branch each year. https://t.co/GgHxyDEgy5 My statement following the @DeptofDefense 2019 Missile Defense Review, urging the Pentagon to select Camp James A. Garfield in #Ohio as the East Coast Missile Defense site: https://t.co/U7gCUV9RLw Going forward, we must end these shutdowns for good, and I’ve introduced legislation permanently prevent these shutdowns in the future. https://t.co/HE0WGob1f5 One of the bills I’ve introduced will provide a $25B trust fund to enhance border security while also codifying the #DACA program so that those young people can continue to contribute to our society. https://t.co/XQFqR7zFAT I continue to work with my colleagues to resolve this #shutdown impasse, better secure our borders, and pass other consensus reforms like #DACA. Both parties must come together to end this #shutdown. Grateful for the support from #Ohio editorial boards for my legislation to strengthen border security while also codifying #DACA protections for those individuals who are here through no fault of their own. Here’s what they are saying: https://t.co/Ef84JM3JeM Jane &amp; I offer our sincerest condolences to the families of the brave soldiers killed today in #Syria. We are eternally grateful for their service &amp; will never forget their sacrifices to protect our country. The US must ensure that there is no safe haven for #ISIS in Syria. Thankful for the support I’ve received from the @toledonews @AkronBeacon &amp; Cincinnati @Enquirer editorial boards for my End Government Shutdowns Act &amp; legislation to enhance border security while codifying #DACA protections. https://t.co/Ef84JM3JeM For 45 years Marty Brennaman’s unmistakable voice has been the heart &amp; soul of Cincinnati @Reds baseball. He is a friend &amp; I will miss his deep knowledge &amp; passion for the game. Congratulations on your retirement, Marty. This one goes to the Reds! https://t.co/d3FnlnDt2Z As I have said, #POTUS is right on the need for better border security, including more physical barriers. I will continue to work w/ senators on both sides to reopen the govt, secure the border &amp; pass other consensus reforms like #DACA. Great Buckeye meet and greet this morning. It was good to hear from the Alliance for Patient Access (@patientaccess). I was honored to receive their Champion of Medicare Access Award. https://t.co/TaecZU93l7 Had a productive meeting with JSW Steel USA CEO @johnhritz143 about JSW’s recent investment in Mingo Junction, #Ohio. The new steel plant will create 1000 #jobs for the local community! https://t.co/pypdUuhPiP Ending gov’t shutdowns for good will provide lawmakers w/ more time to reach a responsible resolution to budget negotiations, give federal workers  more stability &amp; ensure we avoid disruptions that hurt our economy. My bill will help accomplish that goal. https://t.co/HE0WGnTqnx Great article on @ENERGY’s intent to pursue the uranium enrichment demonstration program in #Piketon. It's expected to create new #jobs &amp; strengthen national energy &amp; defense security. https://t.co/0ldT8xXPj8 https://t.co/6sYDG9H96x The Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act, which includes several of my provisions, has been signed into law. It will give communities more flexibility in ensuring they meet Clean Water Act requirements so that the water infrastructure is healthy &amp; safe for all #Ohioans. I had a productive meeting this morning with the US Ambassador to #Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, on the latest developments in #Ukraine. As co-founder of the #Senate Ukraine Caucus, I’ll continue to lead efforts to support Ukraine’s sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression. https://t.co/S1kK42hrsq https://t.co/jjEcoQDwk4 I commend @POTUS for signing my bipartisan Tropical Forest Conservation Reauthorization Act into law. This measure takes significant strides toward building stronger relationships w/ countries while ensuring our natural resources are protected &amp; ensured for future generations. Good read from @sanduskyregistr about my bipartisan bill to protect the #GreatLakes from harmful algal blooms that is now law of the land. As the world’s largest freshwater system these lakes are indispensable to the health &amp; economy of #Ohio &amp; the US. https://t.co/1ll7Te9tBw
