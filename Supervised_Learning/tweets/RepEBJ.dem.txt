As we rejoice and spend time with our loved ones, let us offer our prayers for the 14,000 unaccompanied, immigrant children who are still separated from their families and living without knowing when they will be reunited with their parents. Wishing everyone celebrating a very Merry Christmas! May this day bring peace and joy! https://t.co/hZvUCTYF5I Here's my full statement on the #TrumpShutdown:
https://t.co/csmYaSytfF Democrats presented Pres. Trump with a simple proposal days ago: keep the government funded through a bipartisan plan that provided more than $1 billion for border security. Pres. Trump instead chose an unattainable, irresponsible $5 billion wall over the American people. House Democrats and Senators from both parties are ready to keep the government open. The Senate has already voted to do so. If the government does indeed shutdown it will be because POTUS rejected a bipartisan deal. #TrumpShutdown On the floor of the House discussing my bill, the Quantum Initiative! Watch now: https://t.co/dX0Ns3dzDV Sen. Murphy is right. This will move us in the right direction, but at the same time, Trump's School Safety Commission Report will not make schools safer for our children.

Register to vote at https://t.co/u44bEW5BgR today! #GoVote #NationalVoterRegistrationDay https://t.co/WCwPsgkcLb I agree with Chief Hall's decision to fire Amber Guyger and hope it represents the first step in our search for justice for Botham Jean. I continue to keep Mr. Jean and his family in my prayer.

https://t.co/fQlnblcB5E Any attempt by Pres. Trump at intimidating Rod Rosenstein, either during or after their meeting on Thursday, cannot be tolerated. The DOJ’s independence is critical to maintaining the rule of law, and Dir. Mueller’s investigation must proceeded unimpeded. I support Sen. Feinstein’s call to halt Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination until the FBI can investigate both credible allegations against him. No single nominee should be confirmed to #SCOTUS with so many red flags. Thanks to @TexasVeterans for bringing more than $1.4 million to DFW for our veterans. Congratulations to all the great organizations who will serve our veteran community with these funds! https://t.co/SoSKEebJ1g On #NTxGivingDay, I encourage everyone to support @FrontofFlight who help promote #STEM to 30,000 students all over North Texas!

@NTxGivingDay It's vital that young people get involved, get engaged and vote! I was delighted to spend some time yesterday at Townview and Paul Quinn urging students to participate in this election! You can join these students by registering at https://t.co/u44bEW5BgR by October 9! #GoVote https://t.co/WP8NY1yurv The census is an opportunity to make sure everyone in our community is accounted for and we need your help to do it! There are many job openings that need to be filled! I encourage all interested to apply at https://t.co/w4YG3GMNzn

#Census The future is calling, and this bill promoting research into quantum technology will help us answer that call. That’s why I authored the National Quantum Initiative Act.

https://t.co/8dtwcBDtoS To all those observing, may your fast be easy and meaningful. #YomKippur https://t.co/InZMVwW2Eg .@Senjudiciary must #PostponeTheVote on confirming Judge #Kavanaugh to a lifetime #SCOTUS appointment and conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s story. The American people deserve as much. #ICYMI: The Science &amp; Technology Brain Trust brings some of the best STEM minds together to inspire our young people to begin “Building the Future, Today.” I hope the students enjoyed the program and learned as much as I did. #CBCACL2018

https://t.co/53qvDf9Owb https://t.co/UKLIluMNI4 Supreme Court justices should be held to the highest standard. Judge Kavanugh’s nomination should not proceed further until both he and Dr. Ford testify on the record before the American people. Sen. Grassley should delay voting on his nomination in committee. Veterans have answered our highest calling with their service defending our country. Honored to be part of the Veterans Brain Trust at #CBCALC18! https://t.co/mREhT2zQ4f Delighted to host my Science and Technology Brain Trust for the 26th Year at #CBCALC18! Hope to inspire another generation of young people who want to change the world through #STEM! https://t.co/zkiXAW1eUk In the 24 years since President Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act into law, victims of violence across the country have received support to combat abuse. As it expires in 4 legislative days, Congress must join together to restore it!

https://t.co/kwCqBo5C4k The @FCC Lifeline program helped 10 million Americans last year alone. Affordable wireless service, especially for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, must be protected. No one should be without a lifeline. #LifelineForSurvivors https://t.co/tGizRit5P2 RT @SciCmteDems: READ: Ranking Member @RepEBJ’s Opening Statement for Glider Truck Regulations Hearing → https://t.co/nEKGcCFguz Social Security is a bedrock program for seniors, survivors &amp; the disabled. Proud to join the #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus to strengthen this vital program. https://t.co/YCAXxQKeMA Every day, families lose loved ones to suicide. This is why I co-authored the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act which invests in #SuicidePrevention research to make getting help easier. #SuicidePreventionWeek #StopSuicide https://t.co/9CRvyefBsU When 2,977 Americans lost their lives on this day 17 years ago, our nation showed that when we stand together, no act of terror can divide us. We are forever grateful to the first responders and brave Americans who answered the uninvited call that day. #NeverForget https://t.co/ppoOeboYOV This has been a difficult time for our community. I agree with the decision Chief Hall made to turn over the investigation to the Texas Rangers. I am confident this review will be comprehensive and conducted without bias.

https://t.co/WAEn0mtI43 His name is Jackson, and if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, then Jackson and 130 million Americans living with preexisting conditions could lose their health care. That's #WhatsAtStake. #KavanaughHearing #SCOTUS https://t.co/XfKP0HvTxr Enjoyed a wonderful morning with the North American Association of Chinese Organizations. This meeting represents the growing friendship between Taiwan &amp; the U.S. I look forward to our future working together. https://t.co/bcs0CvE2co Thanks for the reminder, President Obama. This is @BarackObama's message: Every vote matters because everyone's voice matters! #GoVote https://t.co/c6qgiwEPUz Since her appointment, @BetsyDeVosED has exclusively implemented policies that make it harder for students to succeed under the growing burdens of student loan debt. That's why I wrote her to oppose a rule change that makes it even harder.

https://t.co/3XLCQ2Wihe https://t.co/OhTze1gtJI Lying to Congress under oath is unacceptable for a nominee to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh must not be confirmed by the Senate. I stand behind my Senate colleagues' efforts to reject his appointment! #KavanaughHearing #SCOTUS https://t.co/VcyMY3YRFw When more than 90% of relevant documents remain in the dark, the Senate cannot confirm Judge Kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. There is far too much we do not know about his judicial views and far too much at stake. #KavanaughHearing #WhatsAtStake #SCOTUS My congratulations to Duncanville Firefighters for receiving a $43,637 grant! Eager to see the improvements that the already exceptional fire department of @CityDuncanville will bring as a result.

https://t.co/xm9m6az78h Delighted to return home after a productive visit to Taiwan discussing global affairs and security. My appreciation to President Tsai for the warm reception. I look forward to future efforts to strengthen ties between the U.S. and Taiwan, a blooming democratic symbol. https://t.co/Yjgszwx7Bt Every day, local journalists stand behind the vulnerable &amp; serve the greater good. They are not our enemies but are our guardians. Today, we stand behind you as an indispensable cornerstone of our community. Our best wishes go out to @FOX4! https://t.co/GfVLN0lQJ9 First, Republicans voted to take away protections for pre-existing conditions; now they’re suing to destroy these protections in the courts. The GOP is leading lawsuit that could rip away healthcare from 11.5 million Texans.

https://t.co/DqePxlCGaj #LaborDay provides us an opportunity to celebrate those who create America’s success: the working men and women of this great country. As I continue my work in Congress, I pledge to support working families in District 30 and all across America.

https://t.co/AabSBZcYyh Read our letter here ---&gt; https://t.co/NssSR19oke Last week, I signed a letter with more than 40 of my Democratic colleagues to stand up for the rights of home care workers. We are gravely concerned  the Administration is taking steps to change Medicare reimbursements limiting their ability to earn a fair wage. This is wrong. Congratulations to DeSoto Fire Rescue for winning more than $98,000 in grants! New funds mean more community risk reduction. Delighted that @desotofd earned this recognition for their service to @desototx!
 
https://t.co/Mz6tTLv1Ss Schools need new technology, more funding for art &amp; STEM classes, and stronger mental health services for students. Not guns!
 
I'm calling on Secretary DeVos to prohibit federal education money from being spent on firearms. #BuyBooksNotGuns https://t.co/7QRqGyL0Ea 55 years after Dr. King shared his American Dream with the country, the work to bring that dream to reality continues. On this anniversary, let us rededicate ourselves to creating a country where all are welcome, all are free and all are equal.

https://t.co/T9A5kiETWj RT @LBJLibrary: President Lyndon B. Johnson was born #OTD 1908 in Stonewall, Texas. Today would have been LBJ’s 110th birthday. 🙏🏽

📸 LBJ c… My thoughts are with the families of the victims of the shooting in Jacksonville, FL. I will be thinking of all families whose loved ones were taken by senseless gun violence when I return to DC. I pray Congress will finally have the courage to end gun violence once and for all. My condolences to the McCain family. Senator McCain is a true American hero, who dedicated his life to this nation. Our country will dearly miss his leadership in Washington. Senator McCain is one of the most well-respected men I've met in Washington. His courage and patriotism are unparalleled. My prayers and best wishes are with him and his family. Time &amp; again, Pres. Trump took damaging action Republicans said he never would. We already know he wants to end Dir. Mueller's investigation into Russia's plot to conspire against America's freedom. Yesterday's proceedings make it clear: We must #ProtectMueller now! Proud to host a Congressional App Challenge for District 30 and support STEM and coding education! I encourage all students living or attending school in District 30 to register by September 10!

https://t.co/tgIWLaj7tF When the @GOP passed their corporate tax cut last year, they made it clear that was a bigger priority than looking after seniors and vulnerable children. Now they're coming after Social Security and Medicare. I won't let them as long as I breathe. #ForThePeople https://t.co/84PiObKJ5L
