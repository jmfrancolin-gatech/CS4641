Our bill enhances opportunities for hunters, anglers, and outdoor recreation enthusiasts, strengthens land conservation, and helps boost the outdoor recreation economy. My bipartisan #LandsPackage2019 includes a bill to improve access &amp; provide new opportunities for Americans to enjoy our federal lands. The Sportsmen’s Act provision makes federal lands “open unless closed”, establishing a new standard of access for access to our public lands. https://t.co/J5rwBSDobg Whether it’s hiking, hunting, or fishing, these are traditions that have been passed down for generations. Americans should be able to access and enjoy their public lands. It’s as simple as that. Our lands package creates a Volcano Watch Office that will operate 24-7 to provide continuous situational awareness of all active volcanoes in the US &amp; territories. Proud to ensure the @USGS has the resources it needs to strengthen our monitoring, warning &amp; response capabilities. https://t.co/eJg1vSeBdO Reality is that often sexual assault survivors are unable to develop a case against their attacker due to the lack of trained individuals to help collect the necessary forensic evidence. Every victim has the right to access care &amp; to be given the opportunity to pursue justice. https://t.co/IZFloWtLqK I reintroduced a bill w/ @SenatorMurray to improve &amp; expand access to healthcare services for survivors of sexual assault. The Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act #SASCA helps to expand our network of forensic examiner providers across the nation. https://t.co/4Rnh5ARUWQ https://t.co/5ksQgMHBEE Glad to join the efforts to ensure federal contractor employees are able to recover their pay and paid leave that was lost as a result of the shutdown. https://t.co/gZ63PJZj6b Alaskans impacted by the Nov 30 earthquake who also apply for an @SBAgov disaster assistance loan, expect another inspection as well. 
Apply here: https://t.co/iMPyaos3Ot https://t.co/bKXlWz3tzV Alaskans applying for disaster assistance from the Nov30 earthquake: the application for federal assistance is separate from the state’s so you may be contacted by @fema for an additional inspection to verify earthquake-related damage. Click here for info:https://t.co/Bcf35xJ8Ui Thanks @ChrisEvans aka @CaptainAmerica for taking the time to meet with Pages here in the U.S. Senate. They wear their superhero uniforms every day! #PageSuitBlue https://t.co/kx5WmuboaJ To help victims of sexual trauma seek justice and deal with their trauma, @SenatorTester and I introduced the Servicemember and Veterans’ Empowerment and Support Act. We must ensure our nation’s heroes have the support and care they need and deserve. The issue of sexual assault and trauma is an alarming underside of military culture that we haven’t been able to adequately address. https://t.co/CZqw52kWKj In TX we enable revitalization of a multi-use recreation area for visitors. Our bill also encourages agencies to look for new opportunities for fishing, hunting &amp; recreation on fed lands. I’m proud of the many provisions in our bill that will spur economic growth &amp; create jobs. For example, in AZ we facilitate the development of a large-scale solar project that will link into an electronic transmission line, bringing renewable #energy online to power communities. In SD, this bill allows for an airport expansion. My bipartisan lands package currently before the full Senate conveys tens of thousands of acres of federal land to state &amp; local governments to create economic opportunities for communities across the nation. https://t.co/JBHcnqNF6u In order to achieve breakthrough technology solutions, we must ensure that the policies we put in place propel those efforts. We also need a shared long-term strategy for energy policy and for alignment between industry, the federal government, and our National Labs. Today I chaired an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to examine the status and future outlook for U.S. energy innovation, and how we can encourage innovation that will deliver better, cleaner, and more affordable energy for American families and businesses. https://t.co/WfueYXIskx This is exciting – bridging the digital divide is one of our greatest global challenges. We will keep an eye toward the sky and celebrate @OneWeb joining those innovating in Alaska, for the world! https://t.co/46MUwLSPsj This bill will permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule which often forces non-government organizations, such as clinics, to choose between receiving U.S. funding &amp; providing quality care on a limited budget. We owe it to women around the world to make access to care a priority. Proud to join @SenatorShaheen, @SenatorCollins, &amp; Rep @NitaLowey in introducing the Global HER Act which reverses the Global Gag Rule that could unintentionally restrict access to vital, often life-saving services https://t.co/pzDAaP4NHa For Alaskan students, FEMA is offering a week-long Youth Preparedness Camp in Washington to educate how to safely assist in the immediate aftermath of a disaster when a professional response may be delayed or limited. Applications are due mid-March. https://t.co/1ExYpoRYMk RT @EnergyGOP: After chairing our hearing, Sen. @LisaMurkowski is now speaking live on the Senate Floor about the #BipartisanLandsPackage.… @ChrisEvans Let’s call it a tie. It’s time for us to pass this package – to show our strong support, send it on to the House of Representatives, and then to the President’s desk. https://t.co/HDTNWL7sqQ This package benefits Alaska as well - for example, it provides routing flexibility for our proposed natural gas pipeline and creates new economic opportunities for communities like Kake and Utqiagvik. https://t.co/ODGmpH489b This package contains huge wins for Americans - for example, it provides new opportunities for economic development through land conveyances &amp; exchanges. It also expands &amp; enhances access for our sportsmen &amp; women on federal lands for hunting, fishing, &amp; other outdoor activities. https://t.co/WkssNThDzk Today I spoke on the Senate Floor about the importance of advancing the bipartisan lands package I introduced w/ @SenatorCantwell and @Sen_JoeManchin, containing over 100 different public lands, natural resources, and water measures supported by both chambers. https://t.co/rlG1ah27Y2 It’s not every day that @CaptainAmerica pays you a visit. Great spending time with @ChrisEvans and hearing how he is a leader off the big-screen by encouraging others to get informed. https://t.co/ruNLNvmCuQ My response to the President's State of the Union Address tonight. #SOTU 
https://t.co/npo0SCRdMN RT @SenatorCantwell: Public lands are important to millions of people in Washington and across the country. It's time for the Senate to pas… From reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund to addressing the priorities of our sportsmen, this legislation meets a large range of Alaskan priorities and is a huge win for Alaskans and all Americans. The importance of  America’s public lands cannot be understated. Today the Senate proceeded to the Natural Resources Management Act, a bipartisan lands package I reintroduced alongside @SenatorCantwell. https://t.co/zNUCJHO4O1 Tonight, at 9pm ET the @POTUS will deliver his annual State of the Union #SOTU address. Watch his speech live here: https://t.co/SXpSqiKVtD In 2017, we imported 50% of 50 mineral commodities, and 100% of 21 minerals. Whether we realized it or not, both energy and minerals are essential to our everyday lives, and reliance on foreign nations for these minerals is not an outlook we want to be stuck in. We have moved from being a country struggling with energy independence to the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas, with renewables growing rapidly as well. However, our nation is lagging in mineral supply. https://t.co/5OBZUD7E1y https://t.co/7Vf5VY9NkH Today I chaired the 1st official Energy&amp;Natural Resources Cmte hearing of the 116th Congress, w/an outlook for the rapidly changing energy and minerals markets. I was pleased to welcome @SensHydeSmith and @SenMcSallyAZ to ENR, &amp; @Sen_JoeManchin in his new role as ranking member. Congrats to Juneau’s Thunder Mountain High School robotics team “Trial and Error” on earning top honors at the state competition! Best of luck as you represent Alaska and compete in the world competition this April! https://t.co/Fq2KtxwwAW He already has helped the Department accomplish a great deal for Alaska &amp; the nation, both as deputy &amp; acting secretary, and he's more than capable of leading on a permanent basis. I will schedule a hearing &amp; seek to move his nomination forward as expeditiously as possible. Recently @POTUS announced he would nominate David Bernhardt to be Secretary of @Interior. I strongly support David Bernhardt to serve as the next Interior Secretary. https://t.co/XxPjqgrsrA On the 106th birthday of #RosaParks, we remember “the First Lady of Civil Rights” whose bravery during the Montgomery Bus Boycott helped pave the way for big changes in the U.S. Her unyielding pursuit for justice &amp; equality for everyone is something we should all aspire to. https://t.co/ntDyKQMGzN I’m proud to join @SenatorTomUdall &amp; other colleagues to re-introduce the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act, which invests in programs to protect Alaska Native culture, history, and tradition by insuring the vitality of Native languages. We understand our past, ourselves, and our relationships with our family and community through our language. For Native peoples, language is truly the foundation of their cultures and their identity. https://t.co/qA29L0RNzW I was glad to share updates on the work I’m doing back in D.C., including a resolution I recently introduced that would remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. A great meeting with a great group of women! https://t.co/rfsBdfWlnn In Alaska this weekend, I met with the League of Women Voters of the Tanana Valley, a nonpartisan organization that encourages Alaskans to take an active, informed role in our government. https://t.co/qQiUcu6nLq Camdyn was selected for his commitment to a healthy lifestyle —encouraging everyone around him to consistently exercise and eat healthy. https://t.co/xUbSUAKPnp Congrats to 3rd grader Camdyn Clancy from Juneau, AK, for being this year’s @NFLPlay60 Super Kid winner and will deliver the game ball to officials just before kickoff at the #SuperBowl today. Through partnerships involving government, non-profits, and community groups, this program enables wildlife to thrive. Reauthorizing #NAWCA will allow its success in Alaska and elsewhere to continue. My Senate colleagues &amp; I introduced a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (#NAWCA). For the past 30 years, NAWCA has ensured that wetlands across the country are conserved and restored.  https://t.co/OPwSvjs7nl The Native Youth &amp; Tribal Officer Protection Act expands the parameters of the current Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction-- helping create safer, more just communities for everyone. The Justice for Native Survivors Act supports and empowers victims by ensuring that tribes across the country have jurisdiction to prosecute non-Native perpetrators of sexual violence that occurs in Indian Country. Alongside @SenatorTomUdall and @SenTinaSmith, I introduced two bipartisan bills to help to address violence against Native women, children, and Tribal law enforcement. https://t.co/UOO1QDq2iA #OnlyInAlaska do residents construct ice roads to take their kids to sporting events &amp; to make supply runs! Winter brings a unique opportunity for residents of Bethel to create ice roads along the Kuskokwim River, providing a reliable method of travel. https://t.co/sl1I4cnIgk Every year some of Alaska’s best and brightest young adults apply for the chance to attend U.S. Service Academies. I recently nominated 42 promising young Alaskans to be considered for this amazing opportunity. I’m confident they will represent Alaska well https://t.co/EIy09HFXZI Navigating these programs can be complex, so the next step is to educate Alaskans on how to get all that they are entitled in an expeditious fashion. The earthquake and recurring aftershocks were deeply traumatic, so I am committed to ensuring that the recovery process is not. https://t.co/w5L8iqL1hL The President’s disaster declaration opens up a wide range of grant programs for Alaskans to restore damaged public facilities and to help residents recover from the earthquake. It also opens up low interest disaster recovery loans for families &amp; small businesses through @SBAgov. Thank you @POTUS for approving a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration for Alaska’s 7.0 magnitude earthquake that occurred Nov.30, causing widespread damage to infrastructure--major highways, roads &amp; bridges, as well as schools, homes &amp; businesses. https://t.co/hfVRMgHCFQ Up to $40M is available for start-ups &amp; small businesses through #AFPitchDay. Visit https://t.co/A1moBTWut4 for more info on for the opportunity to work with the @usairforce to improve national security in the air, space, or cyberspace. Deadline is Feb 6. https://t.co/stfCXMPvTZ I have long supported the SRS program, which provides vital funding to rural communities for emergency services, schools and roads. Last year, communities across Alaska received approximately $10.9 million in SRS payments. Recently I joined my Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter to @SecretarySonny&amp; @DOIDepSec urging the agencies to make every effort to disburse Secure Rural Schools(SRS) payments in a timely manner in the aftermath of the government shutdown. https://t.co/5w4SwV6Zn5 What’s wrong with this picture? #PolarVortex2019 https://t.co/oySpOF2uaw Looking forward to taking up our bipartisan pkg soon on the Senate floor of more than 100 lands, natural resources, and water bills. https://t.co/XjgIUblYuX There’s a huge difference between genetically engineered salmon and the healthy, sustainably-caught, wild AK salmon. This bill will guarantee that consumers have all the facts, allowing them to make more informed decisions when they purchase salmon. Today I reintroduced the Genetically Engineered Salmon Labeling Act, continuing my years-long fight to ensure that any salmon that is genetically engineered be clearly labeled. We have the right to know what we’re eating. https://t.co/hboWJKgWMb In remembrance of Korematsu’s commitment to justice, equality, &amp; the promotion of civil liberties, I am proud to cosponsor a bill that will posthumously award him w/ the Congressional Gold Medal, one of the highest civilian awards in the U.S. https://t.co/tB3IpbAiq1 The placement of Japanese Americans in internment camps during WWII is a reprehensible part of our nation’s history, &amp; the bravery demonstrated by Fred Korematsu against these acts is something that all Americans should aspire to. I'm so appreciative that First Alaskans magazine dedicated an entire issue to the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women. I was proud to contribute an editorial to the magazine to help raise the profile on such an important issue. https://t.co/yZZiRkbtWs RT @AK_OK: The @Alaska_DHSS has issued a public health advisory: https://t.co/CIAalDKB9t Mike was there for me through thick &amp; thin, would tell me when I was right &amp; wouldn’t shy away from telling me when I was wrong. She was generous, lovely, &amp; a tough Alaskan lady. My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ her daughter Libby, friends, &amp; all those whose lives she made better. I am deeply saddened by the passing of my longtime friend &amp; a true Alaskan legend Mike Dalton. Many in Alaska may be familiar w/ the name ‘Dalton’ because of our well-known highway which is named after Mike’s husband—but the truth is, she made a mark on AK that was all her own. https://t.co/TFJRi3d82F We also passed a bill I introduced w/ @SenDanSullivan that provides for the conveyance of certain property to the Tanana Tribal Council &amp; the Bristol Bay Area Health Corp. to have the ability to expand &amp; construct new healthcare facilities to provide improved health services. The @IndianCommittee today advanced the SURVIVE Act, a bill I cosponsored that improves victim assistance by increasing funding to invest in initiatives such as rape crisis centers, child abuse programs, violence shelters, and other significant resources. https://t.co/ZAgBUyVI1P Our meeting today signifies an important step in doing my due diligence in this vetting process. I appreciate the opportunity to have this sit-down with Mr. Barr, to also gain his perspective on issues that directly impact Alaskans. One of my duties as a U.S. Senator is to carefully evaluate and vet such nominees, to ensure they are suited for the job, and in this specific case, that they have the knowledge, disposition, and experience to lead the Department of Justice. I had the opportunity to sit down w/ Bill Barr, the nominee for U.S. Attorney General, a position he previously held in the Bush administration. https://t.co/zviPtx25ov During the hearing I had the opportunity to address some of the unique dynamics that healthcare professionals face in AK, the impact those challenges have on recruiting &amp; retaining providers, and what more Congress can be doing to help improve access to healthcare in our state. https://t.co/iA59RWFedr Today I took part in HELP Committee hearing on health centers &amp; healthcare providers in under-served areas. The World Junior Championships in Finland wrapped up on Sat. w/ the U.S. Men’s Junior Worlds Team taking home a gold! I’m particularly proud that 2 of these young athletes, Gus Schumacher &amp; Luke Jager, call AK home. Congrats to their team on a great performance. https://t.co/HuIscMb8fh As a cosponsor of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, I want to not only ensure that these federal workers receive backpay, but also that they are told when they'll receive their missed pay. After so much anxiety, we should give them as much certainty as possible. Today I joined Sen. @ChrisVanHollen &amp; 27 other Senate colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, urging the Administration to provide backpay as soon as possible for federal workers impacted by the gov. shutdown. https://t.co/0YtZouiB5r This bill will allow for greater partnerships between law enforcement &amp; ensure they have accurate data from which to work. It also ensures that law enforcement has the resources and cultural understanding to wholly and effectively address this epidemic. https://t.co/7HiSimhBrI In AK many rural communities lack public safety &amp; are often hundreds of miles away from the nearest community with a Village Public Safety Officer or State Trooper. Compound that w/ the fact AK lacks a unified 911 system, which makes accessing resources even more challenging. Proud to reintroduce Savanna’s Act alongside @SenCortezMasto to continue our efforts to bring much needed attention &amp; coordination to the issue of murdered &amp; missing Native women. We have a duty of moral trust toward our nation’s first people &amp; we must be part of the solution. https://t.co/TYCGq09hwX For the ERA to be incorporated into the Constitution, we need 38 states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. As of now, we have 37. The bill I’m leading, alongside @SenatorCardin will resolve any ambiguity over whether states can make the ERA effective by ratifying it this year. The Equal Rights Amendment is as important in the fight for women’s equality as it was in 1972, when AK ratified. Women’s equality is fundamental to the American way of life &amp; needs to be expressly recognized in the Constitution. https://t.co/uAUrQJgdKj On #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay we remember the 6 million Jews who were taken from us. In order to not repeat the past, we must continue to educate others of the atrocities that occurred. #NeverForget https://t.co/c8XTApegy5 My message to Alaskans and federal employees impacted by the recent partial government shutdown --- I offer an apology to all those who have been impacted so directly. It should not have happened and my goal is that it never happens to you again. https://t.co/hksBp6XxEo Disabled veterans deserve full concurrent receipt of disability compensation in recognition of their injuries and pension following their military service. If they have earned both, it is only fair that our nation pays both. https://t.co/HCo29ZqtGb I’m proud to have introduced the Retired Pay Restoration Act alongside @SenatorTester. This bipartisan bill will end the unfair offset of retirement pay and disability benefits for more than 450,000 military retirees. Today's news allows for everyone to breathe a sigh of relief. But we owe it not only to our federal workers, but to all Americans, to take the anxiety out of this process &amp; ensure that they aren't put in this position again. https://t.co/QYJI16jhaP Finding a solution is going to take all of us-- the President, Leadership, the Senate &amp; the House. We owe it to the country to get this right and get it right quickly. https://t.co/xvqjzflHcK I have heard the urgency. And it's not just from our Coast Guard men and women---but also those who work for agencies, their families, and those who rely on their services. This has been a harsh &amp; a difficult time for so many, particularly coming from a state like Alaska where we are feeling the direct impacts of the partial shutdown, perhaps more so than any other state out there w/ how many fed. employees we have per capita. https://t.co/rlxposN8wq The President’s news today was good news- especially for federal employees that have either been furloughed or working without pay for 35 days as they will finally be able to get back to work &amp; receive compensation. But ultimately, this shutdown never should have happened. https://t.co/XDHc3qBQ3b The Senate just passed an agreement made between Congress and the Administration to immediately reopen the government. https://t.co/unkL4dZsBy ICYMI: https://t.co/kRo5SoY924 Our bipartisan group expressed the will and the good-faith efforts that will be extended going forward, knowing there is urgency to get the government open and address the legitimate priorities that the President has outlined. https://t.co/VFwZI3cenw Immediately following Senate votes today, I joined @senatorbencardin in leading a bipartisan colloquy on the Senate floor, to speak to our commitment to engage in negotiations on border security enhancements &amp; passage of a short-term CR to end the partial shutdown immediately. https://t.co/g6lLxgLKKn While these measures did not advance today, everybody—from both sides of the aisle, both chambers, and the administration—need to come together to find a path forward. I am committed to finding a way to get the gov. open and end this shutdown. We owe it to the American people. Thousands more are either working without pay, or are furloughed and unable to do their jobs. Whether it is TSA workers, Air Traffic Controllers, or those who have oversight of our fisheries at NOAA and NMFS, the list goes on. From individual industries such as aviation and fisheries to entire communities—Alaskans are facing widespread, detrimental impacts as a result of the partial government shutdown. @USCG members are still hard at work—maintaining national security and protecting life &amp; property. Today I voted on two measures that would have immediately reopened the government, and ensured that tens of thousands of federal employees receive their paychecks. https://t.co/Rv2bKYREkU RT @SenatorCardin: Right now: @lisamurkowski and I are on the Senate floor calling for the passage of a clean CR to reopen the government f… My message to people is --- don’t give up hope, because now is the time that we all must come together to address these issues. I respect the President’s priority and the emphasis that he has placed on border security. I support him in that and I want us to figure out how we address those priorities. I voted for both measures today because I want to get this government open. I want to do it quickly, and with the sense  urgency for the men and women that have been significantly impacted. Speaking now on the Senate floor on my commitment to working with my colleagues and the administration to end this government shutdown. Watch live here: https://t.co/UswFLUjudx Whether it’s diminishing sea ice that opens up more possibilities for economic activity or developing the Arctic’s natural resources while acting as responsible environmental stewards-- these discussions are an important step in further developing the US as an Arctic nation. https://t.co/1PuOl91pjz Today I held an ENR roundtable discussion on our role in the Arctic, from both the domestic and international perspective. The United States is an Arctic nation because of my home state of Alaska, and the strategic importance of the Arctic cannot be understated. https://t.co/bDJyYpU2K3 Huge congrats to Ms. Danielle Riha, a teacher at the Alaska Native Cultural Charter School in Anchorage &amp; AK’s 2019 Teacher of the Year, on being selected as one of 4 finalists for the National Teacher of the Year award—America’s most prestigious award for excellence in teaching. https://t.co/1TkS08oirw Reminder for Alaskans that rely on @usdafsa services: https://t.co/Tbp1HKiJFo Alaskans should not have to worry about how they will pay for food due to this shutdown. As we work to put an end to this, thanks to Sea Mart Quality Foods for providing the option of writing a personal check to be held for deposit for any govt employees. https://t.co/sYI2utQcHZ Congrats to Willow resident Matthew Failor &amp; his team for winning the Kuskokwim 300 dog sled race this past weekend in the fastest time in the race's 40-year history. https://t.co/aESNp2b9zX Last week, @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung &amp; I sent a letter to the FCC encouraging them to immediately take steps to authorize the use of AIS markers on fishing gear. AK fishermen should not be penalized for using innovative tools that support safety at sea. https://t.co/JhrlWK1Bin Many Alaskan fishermen have found that Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) markers on fishing gear can prevent accidental entanglements &amp; mitigate gear loss. Unfortunately, these fishermen are currently facing steep fines for using this technology to track their gear. In 2018, 260 lives were saved in Alaska due to more accessible Narcan-- which means 260 more Alaskans with a chance for recovery. The MatSu Candlelight Vigil was a message of hope. https://t.co/hPqXVkOcSz My staff attended the MatSu 2019 Candlelight Vigil held in memory of those who have lost their lives to addiction. But, this vigil was about more than remembrance—it was also a recognition of the progress we're making in the fight against drugs in Alaska. https://t.co/2cOOZlRBQ2 Glad to meet w/ @SenHydeSmith to welcome her to the @EnergyGOP Committee, which she has joined in this new Congress. We discussed a range of energy, resources, &amp; conservation issues and ways we can work together to advance good policies that benefit all Americans. #WomenInEnergy https://t.co/iqeacvJuHK I urge each of us to look to the example he set; to consider men &amp; women by the content of their character; to learn from the past &amp; to look forward with hope, supporting one another as we strive to uphold Dr. King’s vision of justice, freedom, &amp; human rights for every American. Today we pay tribute to the life &amp; teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on what would be his 89th birthday. As we celebrate the legacy of Dr. King, I encourage everyone to take a moment to reflect on all that he did for our culture, our society, and our nation. #MLKDay https://t.co/2zNTBpbwBc The issues at our border and impasse over our immigration system weaken America but an indefinite government shutdown is equally damaging to our economy, our security and the well-being of the American people. This needs to end now. It has become clear that negotiations to this point have led us to an impasse. I welcome the President’s decision to put an offer on the table today and will review it in full once details are released. I will encourage my colleagues to do the same. I am deeply disappointed we have not been able to advance a more positive solution to reopen the government and address border security, but my frustration is nothing compared to these families. We owe it to the people of this country to get this place working again. The stress &amp; anger that many federal employees &amp; Americans are feeling during this partial government shutdown is absolutely understandable. Today I spoke on the Senate floor to share direct impacts &amp; ripple effects that one Alaskan community is facing. https://t.co/zh7wPlBsOy Speaking now on the Senate floor on the current partial government shutdown. Watch live here: https://t.co/aAtaiW1UO4 In my effort to advocate for our USCG, it’s important that I’m able to share stories of those who are impacted with other members of Congress as we work to end this partial government shutdown. Thanks to the spouses who took part in these sobering but significant conversations. https://t.co/NRe5HVEslI Today I spoke via video w/ spouses of the USCG in AK to try to understand more fully the implications of what these men, women, &amp; families are going through. The decision makers in D.C. need to realize how directly it is impacting those who are trying to serve and protect us. https://t.co/LY9OMua4yV Thanks to @SenDanSullivan for his outstanding leadership on missile defense issues. Alaska is well represented in this space with Senator Sullivan’s role on Senate Armed Services and mine on Defense Appropriations. The new Missile Defense Review reinforces Alaska’s indispensable role in protecting the North American continent, validating the need for missile field 4 at Fort Greely, Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear, and a long-term future for the Cobra Dane radar on Shemya. https://t.co/FbrndC6QIS RT @AESymposium: “It is great that the need for icebreakers is receiving widespread support and I’m proud to have led the effort on this.”… Glad @POTUS signed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act into law, a bill I cosponsored to provide back-pay to federal employees impacted by the gov. shutdown. As we work to find a path forward in Congress, these men &amp; women deserve whatever assurances we can provide them. I appreciate the AFN for hosting this substantive, informative event, allowing for conversations that will help spur Arctic policy and economic development. https://t.co/fQEkTTfcp8 During the briefing I discussed the importance of ensuring everyone involved has a voice and a say in developing and implementing policies, and demonstrating that the issues in Alaska that are often so extreme that most cannot appreciate or understand the issues at hand. https://t.co/jmWaUzO7vb AFN held their annual Alaska Day event in D.C. to discuss the opportunities &amp; challenges we face at our northernmost border. The briefing included military personnel, the AK Congressional Delegation, Cabinet officials, energy executives, &amp; AK Native leaders from across the state. https://t.co/uDKRTfOqTh I am proud to join with this group in an effort to persuade the US Court of Appeals that ICWA is in fact constitutional and that the Texas federal court decision is inconsistent with Congress’ plenary power over matters of Indian Affairs. https://t.co/rK1BVaWAxb That court decision upends decades of cooperation between the State of AK &amp; AK tribes to ensure that Native children in need of aid are placed in culturally supportive environments. ICWA is among the most significant pieces of Indian legislation Congress has ever enacted. .@RepDonyoung &amp; I, alongside five other Congressional colleagues, filed an amicus curiae brief w/ the Fifth Circuit, US Court of Appeals in support of the Indian Child Welfare Act or ICWA. This follows an Oct 4, 2018 Texas federal court ruling deeming ICWA as unconstitutional. In Alaska, @usdafsa offices in Palmer and Delta Junction will open on January 17, 18, and 22 for limited purposes. If you have questions or need assistance from FSA, please contact the offices directly. https://t.co/Rkh1rY5291 Many of the @usdafsa offices will be opened for select dates during the partial shutdown—good information for those that rely on many of their services. https://t.co/apG9VZq4d1 For the sake of @USCG, AK's maritime activities &amp; national security, I’m proud to support the Pay our Coast Guard Act &amp; the End Government Shutdowns Act, to permanently end gov. shutdowns w/good sense solution to avoid a funding lapse--for our fed. workers, families &amp; our nation. There's no reason for our 5th military branch or any of the thousands of other furloughed federal employees &amp; contractors to be held hostage due to a political dispute. As @USCG members continue to put their lives on the line to keep us safe &amp; secure, I'll continue to do my part. https://t.co/lqureVghQw Our legislation provides significant support through authorizing grants which will allow us to take a step towards changing the economic landscape in rural Alaska and mapping the economic future of Alaska Native communities by merging culture with development. Today I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill w/ @SenBrianSchatz &amp; @repdonyoung to create a pilot project which promotes sustainable economic growth &amp; creates efforts to reduce poverty in remote Native American &amp; Native Hawaiian communities. 
https://t.co/BD80o8Dt0J Today I met with my new colleague @SenatorRomney. I welcome him to the U.S. Senate &amp; look forward to working together for the good of the nation. https://t.co/bHUn34M0jz If we are still in a partial shutdown next week, we should cancel the upcoming recess and stay here to reopen the government and secure our borders. RT @Alaska_DHSS: FEBRUARY SNAP BENEFITS WILL BE DELIVERED EARLY

Individuals who use SNAP EBT should keep in mind that February food dollar… From fishing, to rain boots and now snow-- XtraTufs come in pretty handy here in DC. https://t.co/c1Nm1onUsw Alaska is home to incredible service members, and the Air National Guard’s Rescue Triad is a perfect example. We’re so lucky to have these brave men &amp; women who overcome the challenges of our harsh climate &amp; vast terrain to keep Alaskans safe each and every day. https://t.co/pJVBg0ET2A I spoke on the Senate Floor about the partial gov't shutdown &amp; our nation’s border security. Count me in for securing our borders. Count me in on addressing humanitarian issues. But let’s allow our government to function. https://t.co/0HrprKMEr1 Native language preservation is gaining momentum and schools like the newly named Juneau-Douglas https://t.co/FnXKK5j7yd Kalé High School are paving the way. Proud to see young Alaskans focused on keeping traditional language alive. https://t.co/WusyEdIwge I’ve heard from some regarding the gov't shutdown that those impacted can just go out &amp; get a second job. But there are many communities in Alaska where you don't have a lot of options. These secondary jobs are simply not available to many of our rural Alaskans. https://t.co/sE13hHTNVJ We want border security. I think that the President's request for a comprehensive view of how we address this is not so unreasonable. Let's treat his border priority as a request for supplemental appropriations. But let's not keep the gov't shut down while we do this. https://t.co/4sAuuGoza0 We had a tough earthquake November 30 that a lot of folks are still digging out of-- many of which have to pay contractors to address the damage that occurred. These folks are feeling a lot of anxiety b/c many of them are depending on paychecks that they won't receive right away. https://t.co/S8fK64hTxL We all appreciate the work of the Coast Guard who are helping Americans every day and putting their lives on the line for us. So the fact that they are not protected b/c of the gov't shutdown at this point in time causes me great concern, anxiety, &amp; stress-- as is it does them. https://t.co/gCxCW1gom7 This legislation permanently ends government shutdowns with a commonsense solution to avoid a funding lapse, ensuring the jobs and livelihoods of federal workers and contractors are not held hostage during political disputes. https://t.co/kjLKIghAR3 The ripple effect of a government shutdown has consequences for all Alaskans, most directly on the thousands of federal employees &amp; thousands more that rely on fed. agencies. I’m proud to support the End Government Shutdowns Act for our fed. employees, their families &amp;our nation. About to speak on the Senate floor about the current partial government shutdown. Watch here: https://t.co/mOaoi6v8K8 I met w/ @SecretaryPerry to discuss continuing our work together on energy innovation, cybersecurity, advanced nuclear, and other solutions to provide more affordable and reliable energy to Alaskans and all Americans. https://t.co/YUzCd5KHZL I'm proud to have been chosen by my Republican colleagues on the Energy &amp; Natural Resources Cmte to serve as the panel’s chairman for the 116th Congress. Our cmte has a great history of accomplishment &amp; I'll do everything I can to keep that tradition going https://t.co/YtHk8Mg6NB With Alaskans being impacted by the partial shutdown, I appreciate the outreach of Alaskan organizations to federal employees experiencing fiscal uncertainties while the government remains shutdown. https://t.co/l1x04dRxyE On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay and every day, I’m grateful to the brave men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping our communities safe and secure. https://t.co/hvQVTacGTe Thanks to an agreement reached with many of my colleagues, it was placed directly on the Senate calendar yesterday through the Rule 14 process for expedited consideration early in this Congress. Yesterday, @SenatorCantwell &amp; I reintroduced a bipartisan pkg of more than 100 public lands, natural resources &amp; water bills. While disappointed we weren’t able to pass this at the end of the last Congress, we remain committed to its important provisions. https://t.co/fl2IhwVcPE https://t.co/cdraTIupdA We as appropriators have done good work on the funding bills not yet enacted, and so I will be actively working with the Majority Leader to finding a solution to fund the government and end this partial government shutdown. It’s important that we continue the debate on how we address border security &amp; address the President’s top priorities, but it’s possible to provide for security &amp; to address the humanitarian crisis on our border, while still doing our jobs to keep the government fully functional. I continue to stress that there is no good reason for a shutdown. The reality is thousands of federal employees &amp; contractors have no paycheck in sight, small businesses that rely on them are suffering &amp; there’s no reason they should be held hostage to a political dispute. https://t.co/VBMNUACU78 Approving this request would ensure that federal disaster assistance is made available to those hardest hit by the earthquake and provide much-needed aid to help individuals and communities recover from extensive and widespread damage. I joined @SenDanSullivan &amp; @RepDonYoung in writing a letter to @POTUS to approve @GovDunleavy’s request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration, providing federal aid to address the Nov. 30 earthquake and impacts caused by subsequent aftershocks. https://t.co/XZyQqi0qlQ Spraznikom to all those across Alaska celebrating Russian Orthodox Christmas today! https://t.co/5g1zMxOJfv Happy 100th Birthday to Urban Rahoi, an Alaskan legend – a WWII veteran, Alaska pioneer, aviator, homesteader, legendary hunting guide, snowmachiner, entrepreneur, and statesman. https://t.co/6cFoKiHMGY I commend Secretary Spencer and the @USNavy for naming a future Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer, the USS Ted Stevens, in his honor—a remarkable acknowledgement of the service, sacrifice, and life of our Uncle Ted. https://t.co/CCxMAojGeQ In addition to his notable military career, Senator Stevens was a public servant, a mentor, and a dear friend whose dedication and commitment to Alaska was nothing short of extraordinary. https://t.co/JayQefFz7J During WWII, Senator Stevens earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Yuan Hai Medal, and the Air Medal for his selfless and brave service as an Army Air Corps pilot. https://t.co/lE7DdL6SXd People that worked with Connie say that you will always find a brilliant, caring person that demonstrates a good sense of comradery &amp; teamwork. I couldn't say it better myself. I wish her all the best in the next chapter of her life. Connie McKenzie from my Juneau, Alaska office, who has been a member of my staff for many years, recently retired. Connie is a truly exceptional individual and has done a great job representing me and the rest of the Alaska Congressional Delegation. https://t.co/SwDh8maYPI My statement regarding @GovDunleavy's request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration: https://t.co/HKQb99qlEf As a born and raised Alaskan, I hope we can join together to recognize all that our incredible state has to offer and to celebrate our 60th Anniversary to statehood. https://t.co/PC249LIOub On Jan. 3, 1959, AK became the 49th State admitted to the Union &amp; has since made significant contributions to the U.S. Alaska produces over 50% of the U.S. seafood harvest, has been a top U.S. oil producer for decades &amp; attracted over 1.5 million tourists last summer. I welcome my newest colleagues who are being sworn in to the U.S. Senate today. I look forward to the opportunities we’ll have to unify around shared goals, to teaching them about Alaska, and working together for the good of the nation. https://t.co/Rj3tVnIK8t Thank you for you service to Alaska and the entire nation. https://t.co/PLHOmZsfys Just finishing a Dan Brown Christmas read and came across this quote for the New Year. 

“May our philosophies keep pace with our technologies. May our compassion keep pace with our powers. And may love, not fear, be the engine of change.“ 
—Dan Brown I want to wish you all a #HappyNewYear As the year comes to a close, check out my latest newsletter highlighting some of the recent bills passed and how they impact Alaskans. https://t.co/vI1QsQzbpK RT @FAFSA: FYI: The Department of Education is not affected by the shutdown. You can still complete your FAFSA form and there is no impact… Many Alaskans and Americans rely on wood as an abundant, affordable fuel to heat their homes. This bill will provide families w/ a cost-effective way to transition to appliances built with the most innovative wood-burning technologies to help reduce emissions. I introduced a bipartisan bill w/ my colleague @SenatorCarper that will establish a grant program at @EPA to incentivize the removal and replacement of old, inefficient residential wood heaters with efficient, clean-burning heaters. https://t.co/ltcv9omF1r This land transfer will allow the org. to renovate one of the oldest and largest Native run hospitals in our country, ensuring access to more advanced healthcare opportunities. https://t.co/TosPWlOzWw Recently, my bill w/ @SenDanSullivan and @repdonyoung, the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium Land Transfer Act was signed into law. The legislation transfers a piece of federal land in Sitka, AK to Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium. I encourage you to read my opinion editorial on how an improved federal earthquakes program will equip our state with new and better tools to be even more prepared, safer and resilient the next time around. https://t.co/QT0WFJIWh1 We are taking steps to help prepare for the next big earthquake, which we know is inevitable. One of those steps is the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, legislation I sponsored w/ @SenFeinstein, which became law earlier this month. The recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake was an unsettling experience for many Alaskans. Roads collapsed, homes damaged &amp; several schools will be shut for extended periods. Alaskans have asked, “What comes next? What more can we do to help ensure that lives &amp; property are protected?" https://t.co/hbjGWI2KVV Season’s greetings, everyone! The holidays are a time that should be spent with family, friends and loved ones, reflecting on the blessings that each of us have in our lives. From my family to yours – Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year. https://t.co/ecuYuK5nGJ Wrapping gifts last night singing loudly “Go Tell it on The Mountain”. Also — we proudly recycle Christmas boxes. https://t.co/B4Rv8nnTmi Christmas Eve and we are just decorating the tree at the cabin. Wonderful traditions of decorations the boys made when they were little, Verne’s sandals, our angel, and my Coast Guard icebreaker! https://t.co/WOyWB8ovns Cross-country skiing in Girdwood Valley—doesn’t get much better than this. https://t.co/SyQe0aDKJV How to shake the holiday stress—cross-country skiing in gorgeous Alaska scenery. I got my cross-country skis in High School. Still going strong! https://t.co/AvqmMXxOkr Today is a special day in Alaska’s history. 50 yrs ago Gov. Hickel appointed a young veteran &amp; attorney named Ted Stevens to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. Click here for my op-ed honoring Ted for his key role in improving &amp; shaping Alaska's future. https://t.co/OTCsJ5t7f3 Details on the effects of the partial government shutdown and frequently asked questions can be found on my website here: 
https://t.co/DRFFCqTT9j Shutting down the government is no way to govern. It is disruptive, harmful, wasteful &amp; could leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees w/out paychecks over Christmas. I’m committed to working w/ my colleagues to end this partial shutdown.  https://t.co/OZ3X2Zd8DO I'm encouraged that the Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader made a public commitment tonight to keep working to find a solution to funding the government and addressing border security in a manner the President will accept. We owe it to the American people to govern. I’m disappointed we could not reach an agreement tonight. Funding the government is a fundamental part of our responsibility to govern. We all should commit to end this partial shutdown as soon as possible. https://t.co/yrXJjbt92g Our nation has benefited from the viewpoints expressed by General Kelly &amp; General Mattis, both of whom are unfortunately leaving the White House. My advice to the President is that he reconsider the Syrian withdrawal as he gets his new senior military team in place.
