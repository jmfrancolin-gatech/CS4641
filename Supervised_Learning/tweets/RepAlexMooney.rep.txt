Great discussion this morning with @EPT_RobandDave! https://t.co/gSMKXZtZNt RT @WVGovernor: I can’t tell you how proud I am to welcome Infor to the Mountain State.

https://t.co/zvSnT14Vbz I agree with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump —it is time that Congress passes the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 784). It simply protects unborn babies that a preponderance of scientific evidence has proven can feel pain. #ProLie 

https://t.co/zkwAKVSoQ4 Great to see so many constituents from West Virginia advocating on behalf of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. I always appreciate hearing their stories from the frontlines and ways we can help prevent drug use. #helpandhopewv #wv02 https://t.co/ceT6XNVVzv Glad to have my constituent from Charleston, Brian Ulery, COO of the Thomas Health System as my guest for #SOTU Great speech @realDonaldTrump! https://t.co/POzcuoRiVm While there is more work to be done, West Virginians are optimistic about the future thanks to President Trump. I look forward to continuing to work with our President to protect our borders, create jobs, protect innocent unborn babies and fight for individual liberties. #SOTU Despite constant attacks from liberals and obstruction by Democrats in Congress, President Trump has stood firm and delivered on the promises he made to the American people.... Tonight, President Donald Trump outlined a bold agenda that will continue to grow the economy and keep America safe... "We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" #SOTU "We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs." #SOTU "Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people." #SOTU "My Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem." #SOTU "America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are born free, and we will stay free." #SOTU "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU #ProLife "There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days." #SOTU #ProLife "Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure." #SOTU "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.  So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe." #SOTU "Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl." #SOTU USA! USA! USA! #SOTU "My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.  Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations." #SOTU #Jobs #choosegreatness "We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.

We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms." #SOTU #choosegreatness "Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps." #SOTU "We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started." #SOTU #choosegreatness But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. #SOTU RT @WhiteHouse: LIVE now: President Trump’s second State of the Union Address https://t.co/K4ytXhQmIX RT @ShaunaJWV: New commander of #WV Air National Guard tells @WVMetroNews he has goals in new role. https://t.co/pB2BnjIlAS By @JakeFlatley… Looking forward to hearing from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump tonight about his agenda to continue growing the economy and protecting our borders. #wv02 #wvpol https://t.co/1VqECbyDz2 Congratulations to Steven Mann of MannCave Distillery in Lewis County on opening!

Thank you @RepDaveBrat for bringing this important piece of legislation forward, as we can never afford to forget about our nation’s most vulnerable in a time of crisis.
