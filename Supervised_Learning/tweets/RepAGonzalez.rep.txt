Jim has always encouraged me to go where I thought I could be the most useful. For me, that was Congress. Proud to share this moment with him today. https://t.co/75auCeRNFy We need to ensure we are doing our jobs, and that means putting an end to government shutdowns or, at the very least, ensuring lawmakers are not paid in the event of one. It is time to make Washington work for the people again. For me, this is simple: our government has a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together and solve our big challenges. I have been working in a bipartisan manner here in Congress to do just that. Starting my Congressional career in the midst of a partial government shutdown has made fixing our government even more of a top priority for me. I'm working in a bipartisan manner in Congress to end future shutdowns.

My full statement below: https://t.co/GhqT4ZGzNg Congress has a choice: We either come together and negotiate a solution to this #shutdown ourselves, or we continue to sit by as more problems emerge. Day 34, and we still have not had a single substantive discussion. This is beyond unacceptable. Our constituents deserve better!

On my second day in Congress, itâ€™s already clear that the modernization of Congress is long overdue. I look forward to supporting those efforts. The bill we voted on yesterday was neither a compromise nor a realistic solution to funding our government. Leadership from both parties need to come together and work in a meaningful bipartisan manner to fund the government and put our country back on track. We have a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together in a bipartisan manner to solve our big challenges. That starts with funding the government in a way that responsibly secures our border. Proud to represent Ohio's 16th Congressional District in Congress.
