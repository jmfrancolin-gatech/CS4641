Our national priorities must include affordable #healthcare, fighting #climatechange, addressing the rising cost of #housing for middle class Americans, rebuilding our #infrastructure, and increasing access to #education. On the heels of the longest shutdown in our country’s history, caused by the President’s arbitrary demand for billions to build his border wall, he should use this unique platform to talk about meaningful solutions to the true challenges facing Americans. At tonight’s #SOTU, where President Trump will have the opportunity to lay out his Administration’s vision and plans for the coming year, I worry the President will once again prioritize appeasing his base instead of putting the interests of the entire country first.

Congress should have the final say and there is bipartisan opposition to his plan. We have many other national security priorities that are vastly more important. 

Thank you @kasie for having me on @KasieDC https://t.co/EpLXSCgSDU Stephen Miller’s comments on the border are idiotic and misrepresent what’s happening. These people are seeking asylum. They're turning themselves in – not invading our country as the President would have you believe. https://t.co/zNXNemt4JE The current way we are dealing with the crisis at our border does not reflect the values that our country should have. We should focus on processing asylum requests and take responsibility to protect the health of migrants fleeing violence and poverty. https://t.co/x9fItcDxSu @JKWKachwani The Renton office is open 8 am - 5 pm Monday through Friday. @JKWKachwani My local District Office is in Renton, Washington.

https://t.co/iPRUGm2XRX This move to allow the deportation Vietnamese Americans who have lived in our communities for decades is simply cruel &amp; fails our moral obligation.

Full statement ➡️https://t.co/iN1LNucYto Directing military servicemembers to ‘harden the border’ and provide vague support to Customs and Border Protection misses the point entirely. These people are fleeing violence and persecution to seek asylum. They are turning themselves in, not circumventing our laws. 5/6 The continued practice of detaining asylum seekers is inhumane. It’s abhorrent that there are over 40,000 people in custody in detention centers across the US when we know alternatives to detention are proven to be effective and drastically less costly. 4/6 There's no question that we face a challenge with a rise in the number of people seeking asylum. However, the response should not be deploying troops to our border, but instead increasing resources to process asylum applications, including additional judges &amp; asylum officers. 3/6 The President’s dangerous rhetoric referring to people seeking asylum as an ‘invasion’ deeply misrepresents the situation and needlessly ramps up tension. 2/6 I continue to strongly question the deployment of U.S. military servicemembers at our southern border. The decision to extend this deployment to the end of January 2019 is not a responsible use of DOD resources and is the completely wrong approach to the situation. 1/6 https://t.co/l8J9cRHXNw RT @HASCDemocrats: We must never forget the sacrifices of those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor – and we must continue to preserve the… The #GlobalHealth community in WA State is improving health equity both here at home and around the world.

Don’t miss your chance to #GetCoveredWA! Visit https://t.co/GTDMNRlwP4 now to see what the best plan is for you for 2019. The President is unilaterally taking action on the #INFTreaty without meaningful consultation and coordination with our NATO allies. Instead, we should work with our allies to hold Russia accountable for its violation and avoid a new arms race. https://t.co/kGTBwUJO6b https://t.co/39LfqTkaT6 I join @RepSpeier in opposing @BetsyDeVosED's discriminatory new rule to undermine #TitleIX protections for sexual assault survivors.

His impact on the lives of Americans will continue to be felt by every generation to come.
