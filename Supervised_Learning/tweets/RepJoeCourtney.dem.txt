While I am deeply troubled by the Texas judge's decision in this case, the most important thing for #Connecticut residents to know is that this does not impact your ability to get covered or your protections under the law at this time. This past weekend, a judge in Texas issued a misguided ruling against the #AffordableCareAct that creates new confusion and uncertainty. It is important to know that the law still stands, and CT residents still have time to sign up for health insurance through @AccessHealthCT. Today marks the one year anniversary of the @FCC vote to end #NetNeutrality.

For more information on how to apply, visit https://t.co/Zlqq1s4pBr Only 3 days left in this year’s @AccessHealthCT #OpenEnrollment period. More than 85% of Americans who enrolled during last year's enrollment period received financial help to cover costs. See what your options are at  https://t.co/I2hG02ezOE This week's comments by British PM @theresa_may suggesting an end to this historic peace agreement should be found troubling by all members of this Congress. The #GoodFridayPeaceAccords, which have the active and supportive involvement of the US government and Congress, will go down in history as one of the greatest diplomatic successes of our time. https://t.co/bfiMSEPlfC Happy to highlight the tremendous success of #Norwich Native Travis Grillo and his thriving pickle business, Grillo’s pickles. From selling out of a cart in front of a Target to going national, Travis’s story epitomizes the American dream. Congrats!
https://t.co/NbVbiDp2Kk This week marks the 70-year anniversary of the UN Declared #HumanRightsDay. This commemoration offers an important opportunity to remember how far we have come as a global community in treating people of all creeds, races, and backgrounds with equal opportunity and respect. https://t.co/LxzBBaTuxj The #addictionepidemic is a national crisis that requires the attention of every level of our government. CT-First is a step that will make meaningful change in our communities. @CHRhealth
https://t.co/TYhVpUzfrD The American people have time and time again voiced their overwhelming support for Title II #NetNeutrality rules, and yet @FCC Chairman Pai continues to ignore their call. The message is clear: Americans want fair and equal access to the internet.
https://t.co/s1EzyCY4HF Only one week left in this year’s #OpenEnrollment period! It’s imperative that eastern CT residents explore their coverage options and choose the best plan for themselves and their families. For more information, visit my enrollment page.
https://t.co/I2hG02waGc A huge congratulations to #Norwich’s own Ceil Vardar for taking the crown on #Chopped this season! An incredible feat for this local chef, and a proud moment for southeastern CT. Looking forward to my next meal at These Guys Brewery.
https://t.co/HkpRHIiWOf Today marks a solemn day in history as we remember the lives lost 77 years ago when #PearlHarbor was attacked by Japanese forces. CT lost 18 brave men in the attack, and today serves as an important opportunity to honor their lives and sacrifice.
https://t.co/CyCJeOORVl Approaching the holiday season, the IRS has reported a surge in email #PhishingScams, and it’s important to know how you can protect yourself. Scammers will use email or websites to solicit private &amp; sensitive information by posing as the IRS. Learn more: https://t.co/ZRsxhy0pm3 I signed the CRA discharge petition because I believe that consumers, not ISPs, should have control over their access to the internet. Without #NetNeutrality rules, ISPs can raise prices or force users into slow lanes. #NetNeutrality was working, and it’s time to restore it. https://t.co/ecIPuDKiw4 “A nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought.” Former Sec of State under #Reagan George Shultz and former president of the Soviet Union Mikhael Gorbachev remind us of our nation’s crucial role in global nuclear disarmament.
https://t.co/Bn4rmBqs7V Proud to join @CHRhealth for the announcement of #CTFirst, an initiative created to address the high need for behavioral mental health services and addiction treatment in our communities. https://t.co/IOTZkSOPMz Just returned from US Capitol rotunda after paying my respects to President George H.W. Bush. The solemn honors are deserving to a person and President who set an example for all of leadership and decency. #Remembering41 https://t.co/FbSK2k7szd George H.W. Bush, a son of Connecticut, carried on a tradition of civility in politics and service to others that is too often lost today. May #Bush41’s life and legacy guide us all in our commitment to those who we are elected to serve. https://t.co/FEwDZbyhJq It’s time to #GetCovered, CT! #OpenEnrollment ends on DECEMBER 15th.

https://t.co/nRMUgld1Oc .@POTUS’s trade war is hurting US ag, and dairy farmers have already lost over $1 billion as a result. This week I sent a letter to @USDA urging more compensation for our farmers who have seen staggering losses as a result of this administration’s actions. https://t.co/0BmSNfrlj3 Findings in the #NCA4 conducted by 13 federal agencies including @Energy, @EPA and @NASA report that annual costs due to #ClimateChange could exceed $100 BILLION in the energy, agriculture and health sectors by the end of the century. #ClimateFriday https://t.co/iIwYsp1Mo2 Proud to see many of the important changes that I advocated for as ranking member on the #SeapowerSubcommittee in this year’s @USCG Authorization bill, including a provision to help ensure the success of #NewLondon’s future National Coast Guard Museum. https://t.co/JDEHjpypNk #AmericanWorkers deserve to know they’re safe from violence in the workplace, regardless of the industry. A recent report shows that healthcare &amp; social services workers are more likely to experience violence on the job. I introduced a bill to fix that. https://t.co/Vb0Dbopqov Last night's vote in the Senate was an important step in advancing long overdue scrutiny of our support for the Saudi-led coalition in #Yemen. Time for Congress stop its shirking its duty. https://t.co/sEe39MG3KB Without strong #NetNeutrality, small businesses in communities across eastern CT and the country won’t be able to reach customers without paying higher fees. This means fewer jobs &amp; less innovation.  There’s no excuse- Congress must reverse the repeal #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/2BOoawveHk Stopped by @CSKwilli in #Willimantic to greet some of the hardworking volunteers that donate their time and efforts to ensuring members of our community in need can enjoy a warm meal. https://t.co/4EH6rV9B2A As always, these medal ceremonies serve as an important opportunity to meet and thank our region’s veterans and their families for their sacrifices. Honored to present Mr. Thomas Southiere of #Hebron &amp; the family of Mr. William Beaulieu of #Vernon with medals of distinction in recognition of their great service to our nation. https://t.co/H4dpTsRHU9 RT @CTHoopsNews: R.I.P.

The @UN should sanction this outrage. https://t.co/ODK4lyu2Qh This new report makes clear that the time for denial and inaction is over https://t.co/a8aH6JS0Bw Recent tech failures at the @DeptVetAffairs have led to some vets experiencing difficulties accessing their #GIBill benefits. If you are vet experiencing delays in receiving GI Bill benefit payments, my office may be able to help. Call us @ 860-886-0139. https://t.co/WRAFSOhSQ7 Wishing the families across eastern CT a#HappyThanksgiving! As always, I am immensely grateful to represent and work for the people of CT’s second district. Now as much as ever, I look forward to fighting hard for our region, and feel great about the opportunities ahead. https://t.co/n7Td5u0zQl Congrats to @gerrybrooks as he caps a 44-year journalism career with his final broadcast on @NBCConnecticut. CT’s airwaves won’t be the same without you!  #thankyougerry and enjoy your well-earned retirement. This report makes clear that the @usnavy must do more to fully utilize the capacity of our private shipyards to reduce the backlog in submarine repair work – something I have repeatedly urged the Navy to act on. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/rhkVTIainL A new @usgao report to the House Armed Services Committee this week found that the @usnavy lost nearly 2,000 operational submarine days and spent $1.5 billion on idle submarines due to maintenance delays. Read more from the @usninews: https://t.co/uW23GWtxLJ The House must be able to work its will on issues such as health care, higher education affordability and job training. With her commitment to such a process in the House, I look forward to supporting @NancyPelosi as the next Speaker of the House. Full statement below: https://t.co/IN1txgwk33 It cannot be ignored that communities in our state are experiencing staggering rates of fatalities and overdoses, and failing to provide a proven tool to improve access to treatment is unacceptable. That is why I led a letter to the Dept. of Social Services alongside my colleagues in the CT delegation urging the department’s pursuance of waivers to begin reimbursing health providers for tele-medicine services provided to #HUSKY recipients. https://t.co/JKhnhyKtEx Tele-medicine has the potential to bridge the gap for patients who need care but can't access to it. CT is the only state in the country where #Medicaid recipients cannot access these services. The devastating reality of the #opioidcrisis has hit home in our state as CT continues to see a rise in fatal drug overdoses. It is clear that a comprehensive and multifaceted approach is required to battle this public health challenge. .@BetsyDeVosED's new directives for how schools should handle sexual misconduct will set us back decades, and ignores the right survivors have to hold schools accountable for failing to address their complaints. https://t.co/lU1u6U1EIS Congrats to eastern CT’s Rebecca Aubrey on being named the 2019 @ACTFL National Language Teacher of the year. This prestigious national recognition is well deserved, and our region is lucky to be home to a dedicated and skilled educator such as Rebecca. https://t.co/mS2REo3AtD Incidents of violence against workers in the industries health care &amp; social service appear at a rate 12X higher than the rates for the overall workforce.

The @USCG Museum project in #NewLondon celebrates eastern CT’s deep connection to our @USCG. Congressional action this week to expand funding opportunities for the museum sends a strong message about the potential of the project. https://t.co/vvBmtIWhPl RT @NationalNurses: Press Release: Nurses Applaud Introduction of Federal Legislation to Prevent #WorkplaceViolence in Health Care, Social… RT @UConnHuskies: Instant classic 😂

https://t.co/5W9OnqHTx9 As member of @edworkforcedems, I am proud to introduce the Workplace Violence Prevention in Health Care &amp; Social Services Act, a bill that works to reduce violence against the workers in these industries, and promotes the safe workplaces that they deserve. https://t.co/2zOzxNqIHG This month we celebrate the 243rd birthday of the United States #MarineCorps. For the past 243 years, the Marine Corps has defended our nation’s freedom and values around the globe. To the men and women who serve- your country thanks you for your sacrifices. Yesterday, @HouseGOP used a procedural gimmick to deny Congress the chance to debate H.Con.Res.108, which would end U.S. participation in the Saudi-led coalition’s intervention in the #Yemen Civil War. As an original cosponsor, I feel strongly that this resolution deserves debate https://t.co/77QNv6iuhP On the 11th day of the 11th month of every year, we honor the men &amp; women who have served &amp; sacrificed for our freedom. Thankful to have spent this day alongside our region’s vets, &amp; for the chance to thank them for their great service. https://t.co/bTRJaxvJgI #OpenEnrollment is happening now! Through 12/15 you can review &amp; update health insurance options for you, your family or your small business. It’s time to #GetCovered, CT!
