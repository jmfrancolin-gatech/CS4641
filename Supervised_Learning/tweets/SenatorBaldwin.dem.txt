Proud to support #CREATESAct, a bipartisan solution to make prescription drugs more affordable. It’s past time for @POTUS to work w/ Congress to pass real legislative solutions like this that will lower costs for millions struggling to afford medication. https://t.co/IlFsa5XRst We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating with drug companies for lower prescription drugs prices. This reform will save taxpayers money and safeguard Medicare for years to come. Let’s get it done. https://t.co/nyFCYpnTwa Wisconsin is home to world class universities &amp; our international education system lives up to our state motto: #Forward. That’s why I’m working with @SenToddYoung to strengthen international programs that foster innovation &amp; boost our local economies. https://t.co/EyZBAJ8ydy America lost a legend tonight. I had the honor of serving on the House @EnergyCommerce with John Dingell and "The Dean" was a leader in our effort to move the Affordable Care Act forward. He will be missed and always remembered for making a difference in people's lives. The latest move from the Trump admin will allow predatory payday lenders to once again exploit the financial hardships facing millions of hardworking families.

American consumers need a watchdog @CFPB, not a lap dog.
https://t.co/jg2ninkvBW Today I’m reintroducing my PARTNERS Act to scale up apprenticeship programs &amp; provide more people with skills they need to succeed. 
If we invest in public-private partnerships, we can give our businesses the skilled workers they need to grow our economy. https://t.co/ZdTo6rAzVs I have supported a bipartisan effort to delist the gray wolf in Wisconsin since 2011 and I support a vote on @SenRonJohnson’s bipartisan amendment to the Natural Resources Management Act to delist and return management of the wolf to Wisconsin. That’s why I’m joining @SenSherrodBrown and @SenAmyKlobuchar to introduce legislation that will unleash the bargaining power of Medicare to help seniors get the medication they need at a price they can afford. https://t.co/ooUu0HlIWR I’ve heard stories from countless Wisconsinites who are struggling to afford their medication. They want Washington to act. It’s past time for President Trump to work with Congress to pass important reforms that will help lower costs for seniors and their families. https://t.co/Yt2weW5tNy Today I’m introducing new legislation to help lower the cost of prescription drugs for American seniors and save taxpayers money. 

Follow along here: https://t.co/EZ9Y2rEwrY Wisconsin is home to the 2nd largest number of organic farms in the nation. I worked with @OrganicTrade to make sure the 2018 #FarmBill stands up for our organic farmers &amp; ensures American consumers get the high quality, organic food they expect. Thanks for the visit today! https://t.co/duhMWr6biz Such a pleasure meeting with #WI Tribal Colleges. For years, the Menominee Nation &amp; Ojibwa Community Colleges have provided Native students with access to higher education on their own reservations. We must reauthorize the Higher Education Act to support Wisconsin tribes. https://t.co/xYSeydzaOc We can’t lose sight of the fact that voting rights remain under attack in our country. The struggle to protect the right to vote is essential to the broader struggle for economic &amp; social justice. We must work to break down barriers so everyone’s voice is heard in our Democracy. This #BlackHistoryMonth I’m honoring and celebrating Wisconsin civil rights leaders like Ezekiel Gillespie, who won a landmark voting rights case with the #WI Supreme Court and moved our state #Forward in 1866. https://t.co/uPXmldmJ1G We lost a brave public servant today when a @MilwaukeePolice officer was fatally shot in the line of duty. My thoughts are with the family and MPD as our community mourns this tragic loss of life. In @SecAzar’s confirmation hearing, I told him about Wisconsinites struggling to afford insulin &amp; asked why Eli Lilly + others keep increasing prices. He blamed “the system” and gave no real answers. That’s not good enough. The Trump admin must work with us to bring down costs. https://t.co/esyNhBkd2T In recent years, the cost of insulin has skyrocketed. We need answers from these drug companies who are jacking up prices on the insulin that millions of Americans with Diabetes rely on to live. https://t.co/gEtdUPRrFW RT @_ACHP: Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for the great conversation today. Look forward to continuing to work together on critical #healthcare… Diane and I are heading in to the State of the Union. It’s time for President Trump to keep his promise to work with Congress on real legislative solutions to help Wisconsin families get the medication they need, at a price they can afford. We’ll be watching! #SOTU https://t.co/c9uiJfucGJ Diane is one of the countless Wisconsinites I’ve heard from who can't afford the medicine they need. She’s joining me tonight for #SOTU2019 because she wants us to take on #BigPharma and lower the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/sWLThwJRvD I have joined @SenAmyKlobuchar on legislation to unleash the bargaining power of seniors for a better deal on prescription drug costs. We need to get this done because it will lower costs for seniors and save taxpayers money.
https://t.co/2OUJqQdN5E We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower prescription drug prices in Medicare. President Trump said he supported this in 2016 but has done nothing about it. Washington must act to lower the cost of prescription drugs. President Trump and Congressional Republicans gave huge tax breaks to the top 1% and big corporations. #BigPharma got billions in tax breaks, announced corporate stock buybacks and hiked the price of medications that Wisconsinites need. We need to take on big drug companies. I’m so glad Diane is with me today for #SOTU2019. We’re sending a message to President Trump that Washington must act on real solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We need to help Wisconsin families get the medication they need, at a price they can afford. https://t.co/SeirPOOiHO Wishing Hammerin’ Hank Aaron a happy 85th birthday today! He will always be a #MKE favorite. #ThisIsMyCrew #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/rqeCCMnq1L Big corporations got huge, permanent tax breaks and they have announced $900 billion in stock buybacks that largely benefit wealthy shareholders and C-suite executives.

Too many workers got pink slips.

My #RewardWork Act is about giving workers a voice and investing in them. https://t.co/JjM7GnHKWs On #WorldCancerDay let us remember those we lost and commit ourselves to making sure cancer patients and survivors have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance. No repeal or rollbacks of guaranteed health care protections and comprehensive coverage. I saw firsthand the damage to our roads and bridges after last year’s devastating flooding and storms. That’s why I worked to bring more than $21 million to the impacted Wisconsin communities so they can rebuild and come back stronger than ever. 
https://t.co/FvHB93JHl5 Diane has MS and had been taking the same medication for more than 23 years. The price of her prescription therapy jumped year after year and her out of pocket costs have drained her savings. She can no longer afford the medicine she needs. #SOTU2019
https://t.co/68OLTnvqiU Diane is one of the many Wisconsinites I’ve heard from who can’t afford the medicine they’ve relied on for years. She is joining me tomorrow for the State of the Union to highlight the need to lower the costs of prescription drugs. #SOTU2019 https://t.co/kGukXzfhTg I support investing in the dignity of work and Workforce Resource in Menomonie is putting the YouthBuild program to work creating career pathways for young Wisconsinites. https://t.co/RG57fy5sxj .@CAIRockWalworth helps build better futures for young people and I am proud to support this federal investment in their hard work. https://t.co/DKSwieTi91 I have seen firsthand how @EmployMilwaukee works every day to help young people complete their education &amp; give back to their community.

https://t.co/0rBC4uO5fo I worked for strong investments in the 2018 #FarmBill to support our hardworking farmers, including @WICornGrowers.

I am proud of our continued partnership in making sure Wisconsin families have access to quality health care services. Thanks for the visit this week! https://t.co/QGGBtTR7l3 We need to make sure our government is buying American products. My #MadeinAmerica Act will strengthen #BuyAmerica requirements for the federal government so we are supporting American manufacturers and workers. The Trump Administration is spending billions of taxpayer dollars on infrastructure projects that are not subject to Buy America requirements. The result is American taxpayer money is being spent to buy foreign products and support workers in other countries. #TBT #BuyAmerica 
https://t.co/uvlDyt5Bn8 Two years ago President Trump said he supported my legislation that requires a permanent #BuyAmerica standard for rebuilding our water infrastructure but he has failed to deliver on his promise. https://t.co/LYiXo8A19T The latest Executive Order from @POTUS is weak, toothless and more proof he is a phony on #BuyAmerica. 

American manufacturers and workers deserve a permanent #BuyAmerica commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work. The least we can do is level the playing field and give women a fair shot at getting ahead because they deserve equal pay for equal work. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay https://t.co/LSeoiWFn5x Many women are working full-time, and many are working two jobs to make ends meet, yet far too many are barely getting by, and far too many women and children are living in poverty. We need to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act and do right by working women. https://t.co/XlOztk40aq Working women make up over 50 percent of our workforce. They are working harder than ever to get ahead, and they deserve to get ahead. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay
https://t.co/donAmXpcGZ There is paycheck inequality for hard working American women across this country and it is time we do something about it.

I’m calling on @SenateMajLdr to bring the Back Pay Fairness Act to the floor for a vote. https://t.co/9iq4Sf4dJK Mr. President, global climate change or as you call it “global waming” hasn’t gone anywhere.

https://t.co/amD3plOSgw The #TrumpShutdown accomplished nothing and hurt a lot of people, including federal contractor employees who were furloughed or forced to accept reduced work hours. We need to make sure these contractors who missed their paychecks are paid back. Federal workers went without pay for over month because of the #TrumpShutdown.

The Trump Administration must immediately act to make sure these workers get paid.

No delays. Now. https://t.co/Eez4xo3eeK I have always opposed BDS activities and will continue to do so. I support security aid to Israel and Syria sanctions, but #S1 overturns 50 years of bipartisan US policy and threatens a peaceful two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Federal workers haven’t been paid in over a month.

They should receive their full back-pay plus any interest accrued. https://t.co/Q2pWuf5ohc As heavy snow and dangerously cold weather conditions spread throughout #WI, please use extra caution when deciding to head outdoors today.

Now that he has agreed to end it, we can open the government, make sure workers get a paycheck, and work together on bipartisan reform to fund border security and fix our broken immigration system. Wisconsin Coast Guard workers are risking their lives and doing their job without pay during the #TrumpShutdown.

This is a disgrace. We should be doing everything we can to support our Coast Guard service members and their families.

Mitch McConnell can and should stop obstructing a vote in the Senate to end the shutdown and reopen the government. 

The American people shouldn’t pay the price for a wall Trump said Mexico would pay for. This legislation will make sure that government officials are working on behalf of the public interest and our common good.

The American people can’t afford to have government officials in the pocket of the corporate special interests that they are charged with overseeing. #StopTheRevolvingDoor https://t.co/naBm93HHvY The American people need to trust that their government is working for them, not powerful special interests.

In fact, they saved a life yesterday.

@senatemajldr blocked a vote to fund the government, including Homeland Security, &amp; ensure these workers can finally get paid, not hold a garage sale. https://t.co/FT6haSyQk1 .@USDA must be open for business to support our farmers. The House has done their job and passed bipartisan legislation to fund the government. @Senatemajldr needs to stop obstructing a Senate vote to end the Trump shutdown and reopen the government.

Now, Wisconsin farmers are again caught in the middle of the #TrumpShutdown and can’t get the tools they need to make it through these challenging times.
https://t.co/iIFE3OQV2G I support the effort in the Senate to vote on funding the government, including Homeland Security, to end the #TrumpShutdown, reopen government and ensure that federal workers can finally get paid. We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower prescription drug prices for older Wisconsinites. This legislation is a critical reform that will help safeguard the Medicare program and keep our promises to seniors and taxpayers. I have long championed efforts to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical corporations to get better prices on lifesaving medicines instead of increasing drug company profits. This bill is a step in the right direction to lower drug costs for #WI seniors. I’m joining @SenAmyKlobuchar to reintroduce legislation that will unleash the bargaining power of seniors for a better deal on prescription drug costs. 
https://t.co/RhiMhp9tIW On #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I want to thank our law enforcement partners for their tireless efforts to keep our neighborhoods safe.

I called on the Senate today to take action and pass the #BlueWaterNavy bill to give our vets the care they need. https://t.co/sxnOYkOvIg Washington has been slow to recognize the challenges that farmers are facing, and the daily stress they experience during difficult years.

Thanks to @LisaMurkowski for her partnership in this important effort to help more women get access to the maternity care they need. Healthier pregnancies mean healthier babies.

That’s why I worked to include more support for our dairy farmers in the latest #FarmBill so farmers have the tools they need to meet these challenging times. 
https://t.co/IqZNQ75dK9 Pfizer got $11 billion in tax breaks and they are increasing the cost of prescription drugs for you. Now they have announced $10 billion in more corporate stock buybacks that largely benefit top executives. We need to hold #BigPharma accountable. https://t.co/JKaQ4Awsst Republicans gave huge tax breaks to corporations and they've spent it on $1 TRILLION in stock buybacks to benefit wealthy executives &amp; shareholders, instead of investing in workers.

We need to rewrite the rules so our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. https://t.co/3xShmrc6mp This ruling threatens guaranteed health protections and would raise costs for more than 2 million Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions. This attack on Wisconsin families must not stand and I will keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/pOoy7ogcJr My bipartisan legislation with @SenJoniErnst will help make sure that when there is a crisis on the farm, farmers know they are not alone and there are resources available to help them find a path through tough times. https://t.co/dIiXQrTx1t As the proud Senator for #AmericasDairyland, I worked to improve the safety net for dairy farmers so they can make it through these challenging times of market uncertainty. https://t.co/pA3K5jzhth I met with farmers across Wisconsin and I took their concerns and ideas with me to Washington as we worked on the bipartisan #FarmBill. https://t.co/LX2yikfr36 https://t.co/vRmtJDorRj Scott Walker's lawsuit threatens guaranteed health protections and would raise costs for over 2 million Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions that he promised to protect.

One year ago @FCC voted to repeal #NetNeutrality allowing internet service providers to turn the internet into an uneven playing field, with fast lanes for some and slow lanes for others. We must keep working to #SavetheInternet and restore #NetNeutrality https://t.co/ssUvsyvknE Happy 382nd Birthday to the @USNationalGuard and thanks to the men and women of our @WI_Guard for their service. #Guard382 #AlwaysReadyAlwaysThere Americans must be able to trust that their online data is safeguarded and used in a responsible way.

We need to make sure companies are meeting users’ expectations about how personal data will be collected, used &amp; protected.

I worked with @SenBrianSchatz on the #DataCareAct to hold online providers accountable who misuse consumers’ personal data. https://t.co/65FktUsLMk The #FarmBill18 passed both houses of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.
