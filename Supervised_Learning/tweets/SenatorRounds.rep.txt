Members of my staff will be attending the Black Hills Sport Show this weekend in Rapid City. Stop by to say hello, share your thoughts and learn about our constituent services! Jennie, Megan &amp; Sara from our Sioux Falls office attended the In Her Shoes breakfast this morning. The event focuses on supporting women’s personal and professional development so they can achieve economic independence. #EmpoweredSF https://t.co/cDUj3frjmQ Happy Birthday to my favorite president, Ronald Reagan, who would have turned 108 years old today. President Reagan ushered in a new era of conservative leadership that would help pave the way for a better America. Here he is pictured with late former SD Congressman Clint Roberts https://t.co/614N9oh0Z8 Great to see Rapid City as one of the best places for veterans to live. South Dakota is a great place to call home. #SouthDakota https://t.co/zcHTdRHbUS I appreciated the opportunity to meet privately with the president’s nominee to be Attorney General, Bill Barr.  We had a lengthy discussion about our right to bear arms, and I thank Mr. Barr for his commitment to protecting our Second Amendment rights. https://t.co/s1E22Gqos2 Cosponsored the bipartisan CREATES Act again this congress--it would enhance competition in the prescription drug market by fast tracking approval of lower-cost generics, saving consumers $$$. More here: https://t.co/rP8V5b8x7N Congratulations to Sioux Falls Roosevelt HS student Bryn Ellwein, who has received a fully qualified offer of appointment to @WestPoint_USMA. We wish her all the best! More info on academy nominations can be found here:  https://t.co/yaoc0Kq6kZ The American people expect results. I’m ready to work with anyone – on either side of the aisle – to tackle these issues head-on. I also wish to thank the president for his strong commitment to defending innocent life. I thank the president for prioritizing these important issues in his address to Congress and the nation tonight. This includes enacting policies that further grow our economy, strengthening national defense &amp; border security, making sure all Americans have access to affordable health care, opening new markets  through strong trade agreements, &amp; improving our nation’s infrastructure. Reminding us that much more unites us than divides us as Americans, he called on us to set aside our differences and tackle the tough issues before us. I couldn’t agree more. We all want to make our country safer, freer and more prosperous for the future. Tonight, @realDonaldTrump @POTUS laid out a vision for our country that builds upon the successes of the past two years to further strengthen our economy and keep us safe. Great to visit with more than 40 members of the SD Association of Rural Water Systems while they were in town today to talk about rural water issues! Also got to deliver tonight's #SOTU2019 ticket to my guest, Troy Larson, Exec. Dir. of the Lewis &amp; Clark Regional Water System. https://t.co/rWX2UzXt3v Great to meet with Tracy and Matthew w/ the Agricultural Retailers Association today to discuss a number of issues, including free and fair trade. Increasing U.S. trading partnerships is important to the overall health of our economy, especially for SD’s ag industry. https://t.co/YaNM2uQyQe Pleased to see the @USDAForeignAg report over 600,000 metric tons of US soybeans sold to China. This is a positive step, but we have a long way to go to return lost market share. #tradenotaid https://t.co/kjGVDbDt8K Today, @USNavy announced the next Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship will be named USS Pierre, in honor of our capital city. SD citizens are proud supporters of our military and we are thrilled to have USS Pierre join the Navy's fleet. More info: https://t.co/2yXWD1t4Pe https://t.co/Qf1kGjHCgQ My guest for the #SOTU tomorrow night will be Troy Larson, Executive Director of the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System. Troy's hard work and leadership are critical to making sure safe and reliable water is delivered to communities and farms across South Dakota, Iowa and MN. For the past 15 consecutive years, the #SuperBowl has had a display made in South Dakota by @Daktronics. #SuperBowl53 will be no different. Thanks for making our state proud - keep up the good work! https://t.co/UmzTAAG9JG Today, I had the honor of delivering the keynote address at the commissioning ceremony for USS South Dakota. South Dakotans are proud to have this magnificent vessel bear the name of our great state. #SouthDakota #USSSouthDakota https://t.co/dZGK9ViX8E https://t.co/mG7wFFECZ2 Last night, I had the opportunity to meet Senior Chief Chris Peddycoart, from Oacoma, who is the Lead Culinary Specialist on USS South Dakota. I also met Dick Hackley who served aboard USS South Dakota BB-57 during WWII. Thankful to these two men for their service. https://t.co/Q5VmuVU3K5 Tomorrow, I have the honor to be the keynote speaker at the commissioning ceremony for USS South Dakota. Here's a look back at South Dakota's connection to the U.S. Navy. https://t.co/tEPvdzAtuV Our staffer Amanda met w/ Dr. Michelle Hofer &amp; Colleen Dryden from Missouri River Dentistry at the Give Kids a Smile event. For 13 yrs, Dr. Hofer has participated in this event where kids under 18 w/o dental insurance or Medicaid receive a free exam &amp; cleaning. Thanks Dr. Hofer! https://t.co/JEjrnr5aKA RT @bloomberggov: Did you miss out on #BGOVHillWatch? Catch up on @michaelarossa’s conversation with @SenatorRounds. https://t.co/eU9FLQcKK… RT @Daktronics: For the 15th consecutive year, our equipment will be used for football’s biggest game.

Thanks for all you do to support early childhood education, health and nutrition across the state! https://t.co/yFhVY0oQQw I had the opportunity to address the South Dakota @DucksUnlimited convention in Pierre last weekend and got to visit with Harold and Bill during their trip to DC today. We discussed the farm bill and the need for bipartisan compromise in Congress. https://t.co/DJ6Dooqu4H Due to the dangerously cold weather, postal service has been suspended in South Dakota today. https://t.co/t5KoReTiSu Appreciated the opportunity to join @bloomberggov to discuss our priorities for the 116th Congress, including infrastructure, finalizing trade deals &amp; strengthening national security.

We had a good discussion about E-15, trade and the farm bill. https://t.co/Q02jPgQ3q0 Our team has a booth set up at the Black Hills Stock Show. We're set up in Room H on the 2nd floor of the Civic Center. If you're there, please stop by to say hello, share your thoughts and learn about our constituent services! https://t.co/yCL5Hv7K0N Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act included measures to temporarily double exemption rate of the death tax. Permanent repeal is necessary to make sure family farms &amp; ranches will be able to be passed down for generations to come, which is why I cosponsored @SenJohnThune's Death Tax Repeal Act. Government shutdowns and continuing resolutions are wasteful, ineffective and destabilize government programs, making them more difficult for our citizens to utilize. Congress and the president must now work diligently on a long-term appropriations package and strengthening border security. The
senselessness of the past 35 days, coupled with another short-term CR,
underscores the need to reform the entire budget process. I’ve said all along that nobody wins in a shutdown. I’m glad a deal has been reached on a three-week Continuing Resolution so hardworking federal employees can get paid and important federal services can resume. My full statement on my vote to end the government shutdown. https://t.co/uUz2XVXEfl Thanks to Dan and Hillary Orban for your grace and patience during this difficult time. The partial shutdown is having a real impact on the lives of SD families &amp; we must work together to end the shutdown quickly for the betterment of the American people. https://t.co/L4ZJBpt218 Over 14 million people visited South Dakota in 2018. Consider making the Mount Rushmore State your next family destination. South Dakota is a great place to visit and an even better place to call home. https://t.co/oi4cE5vqON FSA offices will reopen beginning 1/24, &amp; will offer a longer list of services. We'll continue working to end this partial gov’t shutdown. @SecretarySonny also announced an extended deadline (Feb 14) to apply for the Market Facilitation Program. https://t.co/DuJUEzbrKM His proposal appears to make reasonable compromises that incorporate ideas from both sides of the aisle. I support @senatemajldr’s decision to consider this proposal in the Senate this week &amp; look forward to fully reviewing. Once again, @POTUS made a strong case for the need to enhance border security, address the growing humanitarian crisis at the border and end the government shutdown as quickly as possible. Grateful to the tens of thousands who participated in the March For Life this year, including the many South Dakotans who made the trip. Glad my staff could visit with some of you in our Washington, DC, office this afternoon. Safe travels back home. https://t.co/FOrEqaLBiF Thanks to all those participating in the March for Life today. South Dakotans – if you’re in DC don’t forget to stop by my office from 2-3pm today for some light refreshments &amp; drinks! https://t.co/35tDtUM91U It's a privilege to have the opportunity to chair the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity again in the 116th Congress. Thanks to Chairman @JimInhofe for supporting this subcommittee's mission. My full statement: https://t.co/3XdaPqWBXy I spoke with Andrew Wheeler about this issue, as well as year-round E-15 sales, during his confirmation hearing to be EPA Administrator. Read more in this week's column: https://t.co/VDBu9pWt3v Corn &amp; corn ethanol production are vital components of SD's economy. Corn ethanol has taken a hit in recent years, due in part to the high number of waivers issued by EPA to small refineries. This has reduced the amount of ethanol required by the RFS. South Dakotans: If you are in Washington to participate in the #MarchForLife, you're invited to a reception in my office tomorrow between 2-3 p.m. We're located in Hart 502. We are accepting applications for summer 2019 internships in my DC, Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pierre offices. Please apply by Feb 15. Info and application here: https://t.co/Xu7ElTFzkH Appreciate @SecretarySonny for continuing to provide relief to ag producers during the shutdown. @USDA just announced FSA offices are opening Jan 17, 18 &amp; 21 to provide limited, specific services. More info here: https://t.co/6QWMTDJ6nM Appreciated the chance to reiterate the need for year-round E-15 sales to Andrew Wheeler during his confirmation hearing. Year-round sales of E-15 would be huge win for corn/corn ethanol producers in South Dakota. More about our exchange here: https://t.co/fw9bafv7C9 https://t.co/Oa5a5gYlt1 Congratulations to the @USD Beacom School of Business for having two graduate programs ranked nationally as 2019's Best Online Programs by @USNewsEducation. South Dakota continues to be an excellent place to receive a high-quality education. https://t.co/7Fa36WSdEv I invite @POTUS to join me in visiting South Dakota’s tribal communities. We must strive to always work together, improve relationships, celebrate our diversity and mend our history through reconciliation &amp; mutual respect. The Wounded Knee Massacre was one of the darkest moments in our history. It should never be used as a punchline. SD, where the Wounded Knee Massacre took place, is currently home to nearly 80k enrolled tribal members. On that day in 1890 more than 200 Lakota men, women and children were killed. Congratulations to my friend Dana Dykhouse on being elected chair of the State Chamber Board. As a leader, Dana will strive to move South Dakota forward. https://t.co/eoavA8A08I Pleased to join the SD Rural Electric Association at their annual convention today. Our rural electric co-ops provide a vital service to countless South Dakota families and businesses. Thank you, @SDCOOPPower for all you do provide affordable, reliable power across the state! https://t.co/k9f5aUJtB7 Joined @BloombergTV this week to discuss the impact the partial gov't shutdown is having on South Dakotans. It's time to end the shutdown and strengthen border security. https://t.co/VfesHlV95p What a positive experience for Dillon Nelson from Pine Ridge. The lessons you learned during this fellowship at @SDState will have an impact for years to come. Congratulations and good work! https://t.co/xClqdFL9x6 Great having Drs. Wayne and Crystal Pauli in Washington, D.C., today for the @NSAGov’s cyber research showcase. @DakotaState’s talented faculty and staff are highly-regarded in preparing tomorrow’s cyber workforce. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/hoTd6Bf4iE A great small business is expanding into South Dakota. It is expected they will create 60 jobs in Madison and have a $30 million impact on the area. Welcome to South Dakota, @trushrimp! https://t.co/AZRjf2ooK6 The veterans in my office have served the country in our armed forces, and working in a Senate office is an extension of that service. We’re grateful for the unique skills they bring to the job. https://t.co/J37XGZ93e1 As a member of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, being able to consult with the veteran staffers in my office about their experiences and seek their advice helps me to make well-informed decisions. A @MilitaryTimes story out today shows fewer than 2% of congressional staff members are veterans. Many offices have no veterans on staff. We are fortunate to employ 5 veterans in our office, who work on many different issues important to SD. Met w/ Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to discuss year-round E15 sales. Also shared my concerns about the number of RFS waivers issued to refineries. Look fwd to supporting his nom to be EPA Admin when it comes before the EPW Committee this year. https://t.co/8lO6sPgx77 https://t.co/5flExhxsgR Working to improve the ag economy remains a top priority, but times are tough for producers right now. I’m grateful to @AveraMcKennan for providing a free 24/7 counseling hotline for farmers, ranchers and families going through stressful times. https://t.co/M9iBUaPjpz Rather than propping up this failing law, we need to work together to provide Americans w/ a truly affordable, patient-centered system that puts patients in control of their health decisions. Over the past two years, Republicans in Congress worked to chip away at parts of Obamacare, including the elimination of the individual mandate and the removal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as the death panels. The Dem-controlled House is making its priorities clear by voting today to protect Obamacare, a misguided law that is crumbling under its own weight &amp; costing SD families more and more each year. https://t.co/qsAIHHseiP Grateful to the @SD_Guard for their service to protect our nation as they head to the southern border. https://t.co/FolwdaMzNm The Children's Home Society plays a critical role in caring for youth in South Dakota by providing orphanage and adoption services. Thank you Denny for helping to continue to make this possible! https://t.co/ZjqTx2EQzj As the border crisis grows and more Americans are adversely affected by the partial shutdown, time is of essence. It is time to work together to find a solution that has bipartisan support in Congress and adequately addresses the president’s calls for enhanced border security. Tonight, President Trump did an excellent job reinforcing to the American people why additional resources at our borders are necessary. Negotiators must come to the table to find a compromise that will strengthen border security and reopen government as quickly as possible. Thank you, @SecretarySonny, for working to provide flexibility for SD producers affected by the partial shutdown. Nobody wins in a shutdown – both sides must recognize the need to compromise as we work to strengthen border security &amp; fully reopen government as soon as possible. https://t.co/GypX07VTEk In the next few months, Congress is expected to vote on the #USMCA. I'm reviewing the proposal in full, and I encourage South Dakotans who are interested to read it &amp; share your thoughts/concerns with me. We've posted it to my website here: https://t.co/KEjIW8u0YS With the 116th Congress in full swing, working to improve South Dakota’s ag economy remains a top priority for me. This includes opening new markets for our producers and finalizing trade deals like the #USMCA. I'll be watching with anticipation @realDonaldTrump's address to the nation tonight at 8CT/7MT. Nobody wins in a shutdown. The American people expect results from the people they elect to Congress. It’s time to get it done. I have the privilege of working as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, where we've focused on developing a strategy &amp; policies that enable us to respond rapidly &amp; effectively to cyber threats.
https://t.co/iAzLpcgw72 Had the pleasure of visiting w/ Red Arndt in Sioux Falls today to thank him for his continued leadership of the Lewis &amp; Clark Regional Water System. Because of Red’s dedication, the Lewis &amp; Clark Regional Water System provides safe water to countless families across SD, MN &amp; IA. https://t.co/tyAhhuoF1S Best wishes to @govkristinoem as she begins her term as governor today. I look forward to continuing to work with Gov. Noem to improve the quality of life for hardworking South Dakota families. https://t.co/W2Gbu09wao Fixing our broken appropriations process needs to be a priority for Congress this year. When we don’t finalize the bills to fund the government before the end of the fiscal year, it becomes easier for different factions in Congress to force a shutdown. https://t.co/j63oSH9Tan I would like to welcome my friend @RepJohnson to the #116thCongress. Had a chance to meet up with him in the Capitol right before he was sworn in today. He’ll do a great job and I look forward to working with him to make life better for South Dakotans.

Wilson @SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson would be an excellent choice to be our next Sec. of Defense. A former SDSM&amp;T president, her experience as Secretary of the Air Force, U.S. Congresswoman &amp; AF officer make her uniquely qualified for this vital role at a critical time in our history. This holiday season, Jean and I wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. SD is the best place in the world because of our people. I'm thankful to be able to work on your behalf in the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/PmshZvvs3u As Defense Secretary, Mattis spent the last two years working to rebuild, modernize and maintain the force. We are sorry to lose his expertise at this critical time in our history. We owe Secretary Mattis a debt of gratitude for his lifetime of service to our country. The world is a safer place because of his service. Even the threat of a government shutdown can’t stop the 35th annual reindeer round-up!

our national security and our entire economy.  The Trump administration is right to take strong action against their illegal cyber actions. https://t.co/DBtsUtUpVf Very important considering the current delays some veterans are facing related to their GI Bill benefits. More on our bill here: https://t.co/RtG0zqcNGR Last night, a bill I introduced with @maziehirono to provide helpful information &amp; transparency to veterans looking to enroll in school passed the Senate with unanimous support. Now heads to @POTUS to be signed into law. A judge ruled Obamacare unconstitutional. As the massive, poorly-written law continues to crumble under its own weight, I'll continue to work to protect those with preexisting conditions and lower the cost of care for all Americans. https://t.co/Yrq1TK2JrG Congratulations to Spearfish High School student Sierra Hillard for receiving an offer of appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy!

Sen. Hatch has served the people of Utah for more than 4 decades. His wisdom, experience &amp; good humor will be missed in the Senate but we wish him well in retirement! The farm bill includes tools that can help farmers and ranchers keep their operations viable even during tough times. https://t.co/c0YtFAQlUA At a time when farm income is down 50 percent and our producers are at the tip of the spear with the ongoing trade disputes, passage of a five-year farm bill is a critical step toward providing our ag community with much needed certainty and stability.

Kofi, a graduate of @AugustanaSD, interned at my DC office in 2016. Well done, Kofi! https://t.co/tw6kiUKQC4 He will be forever remembered for his strong faith, his love of family and his love of country. Jean and I are keeping the entire Bush family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn the loss of President George H.W. Bush. From his time as a young naval aviator who fought in World War II to serving as the 41st President of the United States during the post-Cold War era, President Bush dedicated his life to our country. The EPA should be using their legal authority to not only restore these lost gallons, but anticipate their impact moving forward. These waivers have the potential to reduce domestic corn ethanol demand by billions of gallons, hurting SD farmers &amp; our state’s largest industry. However, I am disappointed that the EPA did not incorporate the impact of small refinery waivers into their decision. The EPA granting these waivers has lowered the amount of corn ethanol blended into the nation’s fuel supply in recent years. The explosion of corn ethanol production has directly helped our farmers, bolstered American energy independence &amp; created thousands of jobs. Pleased to see @EPA meet their statutory deadline with this rulemaking &amp; that they are allowing for 15B gallons of corn ethanol in '19. South Dakota is a leader in corn ethanol production, and the RFS has provided the certainty necessary for the corn industry to become a vital component of our nation’s fuel supply. https://t.co/SsQsOI8J6z Today’s signing is a step in the right direction.
