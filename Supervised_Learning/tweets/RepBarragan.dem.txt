Cold indeed. Trump now talking about ripping babies from mothers arms.

In Congress #SOTU #BlueWave2018 President now saying he wants immigrants to come in legally yet he is blocking them from doing that at ports of entry. Asylum seekers being turned away even though it is legal to present self at port of entry. Hypocrite. #SOTU Was just about to ask how much longer before he starts his anti-immigrant rhetoric. But I hear it coming now. #SOTU How is this winning @realDonaldTrump?

Thank you for your tireless commitment to our families and community. #CA44 https://t.co/Ed2YAnyrW7 Great afternoon at my End of Year Legislative Briefing to discuss the #TrumpShutdown &amp; what‚Äôs to come in the 116th Congress.

Investing in infrastructure, combating climate change &amp; protecting our healthcare will be among my priorities. Dems will continue to fight #ForthePeople. https://t.co/DBYYeBVuue Look forward to joining you all today at my End of Year Legislative Briefing to discuss my work in the District and in Washington, DC! 

Doors open at 12PM! #CA44 https://t.co/ZqOlxNOosz RT @TeamPelosi: Because of Trump‚Äôs temper tantrum, Americans will not be getting paid during the holidays. His irresponsible and reckless a‚Ä¶ The president has no idea what it‚Äôs like living paycheck to paycheck. Even though Trump has temporarily cancelled his trip, hundreds of thousands of federal workers will still be forced to work without pay. The #Trumpshutdown will be at the expense of the American people. https://t.co/RNg8GP0bfH President Trump had the opportunity to do the right thing and avoid a partial government shutdown. Now, more than 420,000 federal employees may have to work without pay and 400,000 will be furloughed. The worst part? The president is proud to do it. #TrumpShutdown #Mercury standards were created to protect those most at risk of dangerous pollution, including communities of color. Any attempt from the EPA to roll them back is an attack on our health and well-being. Period. #PoisonPlan #ClimateFriday RT @democracynow: And: @RepBarragan is just back from the U.S.-Mexico border, where she intervened on behalf of Honduran mother Maria Meza,‚Ä¶ Join me this Saturday for my annual End of Year Legislative Briefing to discuss my work in the District &amp; in Washington, DC!

Call 310-831-1799 to RSVP https://t.co/XxVZqCirpi Had a great time visiting the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana on Monday, where I met with my constituent Hector Barajas, a formerly deported vet. Thankful for his commitment to ensure that other deported vets are granted an opportunity to return home. https://t.co/P8ZI5FdL9D @ImmCivilRights The thanks goes to you and all the amazing attorneys and volunteers for your tireless work. This snipet asking a question on capacity was only after the badass attorneys I was with presented their clients case and CBP was on their 2nd excuse on why they didn‚Äôt want to take them.

The real thanks goes to the immigration attorneys and volunteers (and nonprofits) who do this work everyday. @eeerox Aww, thanks! It was my honor to spend the day observing. MoC need to know what‚Äôs really going on at our southern border. The hard work is done by you and the amazing immigration attorneys and volunteers that do this work day in and day out. Thank you! CBP kept telling us that they were at capacity &amp; couldn‚Äôt process asylum seekers‚Äîincluding Maria Meza &amp; her kids. When @RepJimmyGomez &amp; I asked to go inside to see the capacity issue, @CBP refused. Families &amp; children waited for over 6 hours in the cold before being processed. https://t.co/g6nT4Z3QTe @cabrown08 @avabdc I was talking about this today too. And how my shoes fit the young daughter. I may never see her again but I hope my shoes on her feet lead her in the right direction. So awesome to meet you two rockstars!

For us baseball fans, it went into extra innings last night/this morning but with everyone‚Äôs help, we hit it outta the park. Look forward to connecting in DC. Yesterday morn I arrived to El Otro Lado HQ to see firsthand the network of amazing attorneys &amp; volunteers working with migrants in a safe space and being feed at the ‚ÄúFood Not Bombs‚Äù kitchen.

We‚Äôve been here with @RepBarragan, @RepJimmyGo‚Ä¶ @WendyFry_ They have taken in 14 people including Maria from the infamous tear gas photo. As of 3am, there remains 6 people including a family with a 3 year old and young girls. We are on the side so they still have a pathway for others to walk through. @MsIngaSpoke They keep us together. Caged in the remaining 6 asylum seekers with MoC, attorney, volunteers and staff on the concrete floor out in the cold on US side.

We‚Äôre still here. https://t.co/k8G74bpzTZ RT @DCGirlsBaseball: So Coach Ava and @RepBarragan met in Tijuana and bonded over human rights and baseball. #baseballisforeveryone #throwl‚Ä¶ Seeing Maria and her family finally be taken inside for processing has been the most satisfying of the last 13 hours. But there remains a family with 2 young girls and a 3 year boy here on US soil (and a male adult). https://t.co/Y2IGgzqOUF Spent the last 12 hours w/ Coach Ava of DC Girls Baseball who also happens to be an immigration attorney. All sitting here in chilly weather, effectively caged in.
