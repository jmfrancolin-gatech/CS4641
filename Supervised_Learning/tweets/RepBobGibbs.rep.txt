Having worked with the previous Republican Congress to achieve this, the President is right in calling on Democratic leaders to end their impulsive resistance to working with Republicans. Over the past two years, we have seen incredible job growth and a strong economy fueled by tax cuts for all Americans and regulatory relief for the private sector... Tonight, the President offered an optimistic vision of how we can work together to tackle important issues in a bipartisan manner--if all parties can agree to come to the table... “America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” #SocialismDoesntWork #sotu RT @JimPressOffice: POTUS: "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.
