The #TrumpShutdown is putting the forecasts we heavily rely on in jeopardy, &amp; this lost time could hurt our readiness for this year. https://t.co/NOOyJGCilb On the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican proposed legislation to re-open government and fund smart, effective border security solutions. I urge the Senate and President to join along. #TrumpShutdown Tonight, we witnessed @POTUS use the Oval Office as a prop to spew exaggerations&amp;untruths about what he calls a crisis at our southern border. In his quest for an ineffective, wasteful, immoral wall, Mr. Trump has shut down our government, causing 800,000 Americans to go w/o pay. Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That‚Äôs not a pattern ‚Äì that‚Äôs an epidemic. Congress has to step up &amp; pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place. #NeverAgain https://t.co/5daJeqSlle Tonight, I hope @POTUS will finally tell the truth ‚Äì the national emergency is the shutdown he created, which left 800,000 Americans w/out pay, &amp; the humanitarian crisis at the border that has been fueled by his own cruel policies. I urge him to declare an end to the shutdown. RT @HouseDemWomen: As #116thCongress kicks off, we'd like to congratulate the women leaders taking gavels in the Majority! The incomparable‚Ä¶ Yet another horrific &amp; immoral consequence of the #TrumpShutdown! If it continues, domestic violence shelters may have to close their doors, not only affecting people's livelihoods, but the safety &amp; well-being of survivors.  https://t.co/ieBFUDdVTP Voting is a fundamental right, not a privilege ‚Äì and last November, Floridians used their power at the polls to pass #Amendment4, restoring this right to millions. Now, let‚Äôs keep fighting make it easier for Americans vote, not harder! https://t.co/5xdYaSVcUt Every day @realDonaldTrump keeps the government closed, America‚Äôs small businesses pay the price. Because of the #TrumpShutdown, the Small Business Administration has had to forgo hundreds of millions of dollars in loans &amp; contracting opportunities. As the #TrumpShutdown reaches its third week, 800,000 families are still left wondering when they‚Äôll get the next paycheck -- all because Trump wants a wasteful, immoral wall. It‚Äôs time to end this charade and reopen the gov‚Äôt!

Today, I will join @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @Gab‚Ä¶ .@POTUS could be focusing on ways to help American families &amp; veterans. Instead, he‚Äôs keeping his #TrumpShutdown going all because he wants $5 BILLION to waste on an immoral and un-American border wall. https://t.co/mkhNnVv83k .@HouseDemocrats voted last night to end the #TrumpShutdown. But @realDonaldTrump doesn‚Äôt want to work with us ‚Äì he'd rather hold the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of American families hostage for months or years as he throws a temper tantrum. https://t.co/hGwiB0WUt7 Some scenes from yesterday's #swearinginday with colleagues old &amp; new. Ready to get to work #ForThePeople https://t.co/nT48oJfcKK 800,000 American families are unsure when they‚Äôre going to get their next paycheck thanks to the #TrumpShutdown &amp; still the White House refuses to work with Dems to reopen the gov -- yet they're happy to reward themselves with raises...? Unbelievable. https://t.co/Lpe6qrWCDx Proud to join @HouseDemocrats in introducing the #ForThePeople Act ‚Äì our plan is to empower voters &amp; end years of GOP attacks on voting rights. Let‚Äôs get to work! üó≥Ô∏è https://t.co/FuMeIV0GSj It's been 1 year since women across industries said #TimesUp for sexual harassment in the workplace, demanding accountability from abusers &amp; protections for survivors.

Ready to get to work for #FL21 &amp; women and families across the country! https://t.co/l6nsz6y9C9 Trump said he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù of his #TrumpShutdown, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers wondering how they‚Äôd make it without the next paycheck over the holidays. Meanwhile, the party goes on at Mar-a-Lago &amp; taxpayers are helping foot the bill. https://t.co/BrgGT5xE27 From my family to yours ‚Äì wishing you a happy &amp; healthy #NewYear! https://t.co/aRjem3gM1b Wishing you and your family a very Merry Christmas! I hope your holiday is filled with joy and shared with those you love. https://t.co/evsIaZFIel Bah humbug -- @RealDonaldTrump‚Äôs government shutdown needlessly hurts 800,000 federal employees across the nation who ensure the well-being and security of the American people. We need to end the #TrumpShutdown now! Let's not forget this direct quote from @realDonaldTrump: "I am proud to shut down the government... I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down." Enough is enough, Mr. President - or should I say Scrooge - end this ridiculous stunt and open our government. No wall! Not only did Trump &amp; his Republican colleagues shut down the gov, they let #VAWA expire, leaving survivors of domestic violence high &amp; dry. Congress should pass @JacksonLeeTX18's bill to strengthen this critical program &amp; provide greater resources to survivors! I‚Äôve got one word to describe Trump‚Äôs shutdown: clueless. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/rG8yLvVl0F Thanks to my colleagues @SenatorCardin @JohnBoozman @RepEdRoyce @RepEliotEngel for their partnership in getting the #WEEEAct across the finish line. Now let's make it official &amp; get it signed into law! When women &amp; girls are educated, free from violence, &amp; have access to tools to support their families, their communities are safer, stronger, &amp; more peaceful. Thrilled the #WEEEAct passed in the Senate &amp; the House today. This bill recognizes there's an undeniable link between women‚Äôs economic success &amp; global prosperity. https://t.co/7IS7g8R1o6 Trump‚Äôs erratic&amp;irresponsible foreign policy makes our world less safe. Mattis‚Äô resignation comes at a dangerous time‚Äî@POTUS w/ his Twitter diplomacy has lost the respect of allies &amp; is handing over our global leadership to adversaries like Russia&amp;China https://t.co/47B8uBJRKo Sending best wishes for a full &amp; speedy recovery to Justice Ginsburg. Get well soon, #RBG! 
https://t.co/iSIB7uKydG .@realDonaldTrump has sabotaged multiple opportunities to reach a bipartisan consensus on immigration. His latest tantrum over his immoral, absurd border wall isn‚Äôt worth yet ANOTHER government shutdown. #TrumpShutdown #GOPShutdown https://t.co/Cy1egHTJty 755,000 Americans could lose their nutrition assistance thanks to this unnecessary rule by the Trump Administration. We should be working to help hungry families &amp; children, not taking away their food.

https://t.co/Y1wmPK8wo1 Instead of taking steps to address gun violence in our schools after the horrific Parkland shooting in our #SFL community, the Trump admin is undermining policies that protect students‚Äô civil rights. This won‚Äôt make our schools &amp; students safer. https://t.co/vGe9qSXW7a Just one day left to #GetCovered for 2019! The deadline for the Open Enrollment period is almost here - visit https://t.co/2tc34oHOR0 to find a plan that works for you &amp; your family. https://t.co/ZZd4o60GBJ Florida‚Äôs beautiful &amp; unique wetlands are under attack from the Trump administration. We must protect our environment for future generations ‚Äì not repeal clean water regulations to appease polluters. https://t.co/zXg67eChXA Today, we remember the 26 innocent young lives cut short at #SandyHook 6 years ago. We continue to stand with Newtown &amp; all those that have been affected by #gunviolence, &amp; will continue to work towards a future where no more communities have to live through that pain. https://t.co/B8fdiDXmxm I'm devastated this child died in our custody &amp; horrified this is how immigrants are treated when they come to the US seeking a better life. The Trump Admin must be held accountable for the humanitarian disaster they've created at our southern border. Absolutely disgraceful. https://t.co/2n8veG4aHH The number of gun deaths in our nation is staggering. Despite Democratic efforts to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation, Republicans in Congress continue to turn a blind eye to this alarming rise in gun deaths &amp; any solutions to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/vSXmubX5pt It‚Äôs moving day! Next time you‚Äôre in Washington, stop by my new office at 2305 Rayburn to say hi. üëãüèº https://t.co/gSw56OICza Everyone deserves a safe&amp;dignified workplace free from sexual harassment, including in the halls of Congress. This is an important step to strengthen protections&amp;hold Members accountable, but there's more work to do to answer the call of the #MeToo movement &amp; support survivors https://t.co/5RhTzuly2a I urge my colleagues in the Senate to approve the new construction quickly, so we can provide a safe &amp; secure facility to serve one of the largest &amp; busiest judicial districts in the country. Great news! Today, the House took one of the last steps towards approving construction for a new federal courthouse in #FortLauderdale. It will replace the current courthouse, which has been plagued for years by mold, leaks, flooding &amp; significant space constraints. The effects of air pollution are especially harmful to the most vulnerable among us: children, seniors, &amp; low-income communities. Yet, Republicans continue to sit back as @POTUS repeals critical protections at the cost of American lives. #ParisAgreement https://t.co/LimLqtjQEs Here we go again - another Trump administration attack on our environment. The #DirtyWaterRule will strip #CleanWaterAct protections from the streams that feed into drinking water sources for tens of millions of Americans. We can‚Äôt let that happen - we must #ProtectCleanWater. https://t.co/iyLm9Xhvxr
