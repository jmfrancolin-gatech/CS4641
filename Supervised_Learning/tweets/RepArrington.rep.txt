‚Ä¢ establish a safe and legal immigration system with real border security
‚Ä¢ protect American workers in trade
‚Ä¢ rebuild America‚Äôs infrastructure
‚Ä¢ lower the cost of healthcare
‚Ä¢ protect America‚Äôs national interests abroad "We must keep America first in our hearts; we must keep freedom alive in our souls; we must always keep faith in America's destiny - that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" - @POTUS AMEN! "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life, and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." - @POTUS President Trump negotiated from a position of strength, and the USMCA will provide freer and fairer trade markets with our neighbors to the north and south. #SOTU Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners, representing 15% and 14.3 % of the US‚Äô total trade market respectively. "Our new USMCA will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA" - @POTUS "Simply put, walls work and walls save lives." - @POTUS In fact, illegal immigration costs Texas $12 billion a year, and since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more than 291,000 criminal offenses in the state. #SOTU As a border state, no one is on the frontlines of this fight more than Texas, and the federal government has been derelict in their duty to secure the border. "The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‚Äëbeing of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens." - @POTUS Our porous border has allowed for rampant criminal and gang activity to occur in our communities. We need to secure our southernmost border and BUILD THE WALL where it is appropriate. #SOTU "Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business." - @POTUS "In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, A SWEEPING NEW FARM BILL, historic VA reforms ..." - @POTUS "After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. The State of our Union is STRONG" - @POTUS Great news for West Texas producers! "We have unleashed a revolution in American energy - the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy." - @POTUS The American people are seeing more money in their pockets thanks to the booming economy. #SOTU Under the leadership of President Trump and Republicans in Congress, our nation‚Äôs total real gross domestic product growth exceeded 3% over the last four quarters, with it topping 4.2% in the second quarter.

Whether it was No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, Kate‚Äôs Law, Securing America‚Äôs Future Act, Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, or a resolution backing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, House Republicans received little to no support from our Democrat counterparts. Throughout the 115th Congress, Democrats refused to come to the table to discuss meaningful immigration reform ‚Äì instead, they‚Äôve resorted to open-border, sanctuary city policies. Their stance may have changed, but the facts haven‚Äôt. We‚Äôve seen that where walls and fencing have been built, illegal border crossings have dropped upwards of 90%: El Paso ‚Äì 95%, Yuma ‚Äì 95%, San Diego ‚Äì 92%, Tucson ‚Äì 90%. The fact is that walls work, and Democrats have supported border security in the past. Our porous border costs Texas alone $12 billion a year, and since 2011, our state has charged more than 186,000 illegal aliens with more than 291,00 criminal offenses. https://t.co/ivS5rhgQWN Border security is a national security issue, and our southernmost border needs reinforcements: a physical barrier, advanced technology, and boots on the ground.

Senator Schumer (1/3): "Because of our efforts in Congress, our border is far more secure today than it was when we began debating comprehensive reform in 2005.

- build more detention facilities and increase the number of immigration judges to end catch and release and expedite deportation hearings. If Democrats are truly serious about stopping illegal immigration, as Schumer and Pelosi have repeatedly stated, then they should at least support the following:
- turn off all magnets - no jobs and no federal funding of any kind for illegals; In addition to physical barriers, we must STOP rewarding people who come to this country illegally. Washington has failed us; Trump is fighting for us! Schumer‚Äôs current posture is disingenuous, and I believe he and the Democrats are putting politics ahead of the safety and security of our citizens. Border states like Texas have spent billions of dollars doing the federal government‚Äôs job. The President and Republicans in the House also put forth a DACA fix along with border security, which received ZERO Democrat support.
