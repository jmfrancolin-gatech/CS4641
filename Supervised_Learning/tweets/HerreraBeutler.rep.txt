Cheers to all my fellow working moms who daily navigate a maze of childcare, trying to keep our kids healthy &amp; balancing competing priorities. As a member of Congress w/ this unique perspective, I work tirelessly to enact the best policies for SW WA https://t.co/BXsNAv1GqV This @HouseAppropsGOP subcommittee has provided opportunities to improve workforce training and innovation in federal education efforts, and I look forward to continue working on these Southwest Washington priorities this year. https://t.co/Gqp2hnlKVM Yep, we have our work cut out for us. But at least now that my legislative initiative is the law of the land – the largest step Congress has taken to address #maternalmortality – we can begin to understand this national crisis and reverse course. https://t.co/uELN22o8gH Our first Labor, Health &amp; Human Svcs Sub. hearing this morning. I raised concerns about increased cost of health care premiums for SW WA &amp; how kids on Medicaid often get overlooked. I'll keep fighting to make sure all families have quality, affordable health care.@HouseAppropsGOP https://t.co/ztDqt1V8fc As someone focused on improving access to and quality of affordable health care for everyone, I’m eager to continue serving on the @HouseAppropsGOP Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee. https://t.co/aIdl5FOnbG With trains carrying hazardous materials through Southwest Washington, it is paramount we increase safety for nearby communities.

There is absolutely no place for racist views like this in our discourse. None. Now that my bill to prevent maternal deaths has been signed into law, states will have the tools they need to review every death and develop best practices to prevent future tragedies. https://t.co/toNBtWal2a We can end this shutdown if both negotiating parties would accept immigration policies they’ve supported before.

Passing the federal measure was included as one of several recommendations from Gov. Jay Inslee’s orca recovery task force last month.” https://t.co/DB9wDHh7Sd I joined 7 WA state lawmakers in sending a letter to Gov. @JayInslee asking him to consider alternatives to light rail in addressing the I-5 bridge. Past light rail proposals have been soundly rejected by Clark Co residents in multiple county-wide votes. https://t.co/YEsuVlKVPn Thank you, Speaker Ryan, for signing my bipartisan bill, Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, last night.

It allows families to access the best doctors and facilities for their kids – even if that means they have to cross into another state. https://t.co/CCkkdyeOSf The U.S. is ranked 47th globally for #maternalmortality – our rate of moms dying is worse than Iran’s. With passage of this bill, we are working to reverse that trend and save moms’ lives. https://t.co/enfAUDI7FZ It was great to get this photo along w/ a note from Mike, a member of the @MtStHelensNVM Trac Riders, about how the newly-built warming shelter has already helped w/ a rescue operation on the mountain. It was an honor to help get this shelter completed. Thanks for sharing, Mike! https://t.co/9yGoR2LQ15 It’s been a productive week. I’m working hard to improve life for SW WA residents – whether it’s taking steps to remove barriers for kids on Medicaid to access the care they need or placing Indian tribes on equal economic footing as non-tribal members. https://t.co/dIrKw0JBsP We’re going to investigate every single death because these moms are worth it. https://t.co/Bj54fcywrl My bill to prevent moms dying during pregnancy, childbirth &amp; postpartum PASSED the Senate last night, which means it’s on its way to @POTUS! This is a good day for the future of moms in America. https://t.co/FS2RFnS7o1 This bill is dedicated to the mothers we have lost, moms like Kira, who lost her life just hours after giving birth to a healthy baby boy. We honor the lives of these mothers, the loved ones who remember them, and strive to prevent such tragedies in the future. https://t.co/mTb7i9RInM No victory is won w/o a team. Grateful for the partnership of my colleague @RepSchrader &amp; @SenatorRisch @SenatorCantwell for shepherding this thru the Senate.

https://t.co/fVPhUCd7n1 https://t.co/Wu6jSIkihI My sea lion bill passed out of Congress and is now moving to the President’s desk!

https://t.co/FVN526k7yP There’s not a silver bullet for relieving congestion in Southwest Washington. It will take many different approaches; this is one. 
https://t.co/SUYSU6Pzn8 Thank you for sharing with me the issues important to WA businesses, and how we can keep the economy rolling. https://t.co/t2bK8Z5fS5 I’m pretty excited to see this one headed to the President. This really should have been done well before my time. It’s just putting tribal members on the same level footing as everyone else.
https://t.co/makIgxDjSz Nice work, @VancouverSD They were highlighted as a top school district in the nation for high-quality STEM programs and innovative learning. 
https://t.co/TWfQrCHf0q It was an honor to pay my respects and celebrate the legacy of a great man and president, George H.W. Bush, at the Capitol today. #Remembering41 https://t.co/zbcBCqRVlv Today, President George H.W. Bush will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. You can watch the ceremony live @ 2:00pm PT here: https://t.co/94qVwcKtgn #Remembering41 Our nation lost a great statesman, WW II veteran, devoted husband and father, and a man who dedicated his life to public service and leading with character. President George H.W. Bush, we salute you. Sending our love and prayers to the Bush family. https://t.co/Q0mW98A55X I introduced a bill today to repeal this controversial regulation and clarify that the Clean Water Act remains in effect as it has been interpreted for more than four decades. https://t.co/lTuI40vBuq It’s time for Congress to restore the more sensible definition of “navigable waters” and provide relief to farmers and landowners who have been hit hard by the costly “Waters of the U.S.” rule. Eric died in service to our nation, and for that we'll forever be grateful. My prayers are with his family and loved ones – our community grieves with them. https://t.co/0i6S7XOtQK It is with heavy hearts we mourn the loss of one of our own who paid the ultimate sacrifice: Army Sgt. 1st Class Eric Michael Emond of Brush Prairie was killed serving his country in Afghanistan yesterday. When the Chehalis Tribe first approached me about this distillery prohibition, it was clear that Congress needed to take action and repeal it in the name of fairness. So pleased we are now sending this common-sense, bipartisan bill to the president’s desk. https://t.co/E0ok8gRO1z My tribal-fairness bill is about to become law: last night, the Senate passed their version of my House-passed bill to repeal an old law preventing tribes from building a distillery on their land. Thrilled we removed this economic hurdle for SW WA tribes: https://t.co/BNcQbpJ4Fx In an effort to help relieve congestion for Southwest Washington commuters, I’m requesting the @uscoastguard revisit its protocol for I-5 drawbridge lifts during rush hour.

https://t.co/J4mQqcvjbH This is not right and I will continue to fight Oregon’s plan to disproportionately pick our pockets with this tolling scheme. https://t.co/QPNzoDUGQC I’ve been asking SW WA residents who commute to Portland for work if they have any say in when they start their work day. David says he has no choice, which means if Oregon has its way and implements tolls on I-5 and I-205, he’ll be paying a premium price to commute to work. Today is #SmallBusinessSaturday so let’s shop local! I’m proud of our incredible and unique small businesses in Southwest Washington. I am committed to advancing policy that helps entrepreneurs and starts-ups succeed. https://t.co/WJRoSIgpSe Thank you to all our brave and skilled firefighters – including the 100 who have been deployed from Washington – currently battling the California wildfires.

Statewide, Gov.

I introduced a bill that would reinstate federal oil train safety standards: https://t.co/bShSGHRQBA These are smart animals. Non-lethal methods to remove the most problematic sea lions from the Columbia River haven’t worked; the sea lions are only growing in number.

Starbucks recently announced it will pay the majority of the cost for care for an employee's sick child or parent under a new benefits program they're offering that they credited to these tax cuts. When we passed the tax cuts last year, we did it so that families would not only get to keep more of their money, but to spur better benefits and wages. https://t.co/DMogrXzdNa Navigation jobs – coastal and inland – help keep our region afloat.

THANK YOU to all our heroes: law enforcement, fire fighters and veterans. https://t.co/UKZLJB7tJ4 This issue is a matter of fairness; DC shouldn’t be in the business of telling Indian country it cannot engage in a business that’s allowed everywhere else and is actually helping many areas revitalize their local economies. https://t.co/aLjZq5Zmw0 https://t.co/A6LzYWe4eF My bill to remove an antiquated prohibition on tribal lands passed the U.S. House Wednesday night with unanimous bipartisan support. https://t.co/icRxJrlWLg I’m pleased the House passed one of our @HouseAppropsGOP bills today that provides critical funding to keep our waterways open for trade and also better care for our military service members and veterans. https://t.co/tDCLDONzxh The completion of the Mt.

I recently worked to secure a $414 million increase for Alzheimer’s &amp; dementia research, and have recently cosponsored a bill for the prevention, treatment &amp; care of this devastating disease. https://t.co/qIaNXx3Rd0 It was a privilege for my little buddy and I to help kick off the inaugural Walk to End Alzheimer’s in Vancouver on Sunday. Amazing job to all the organizers and teams who blew their fundraising goal out of the water! https://t.co/oxoJQmFnXG Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I volunteered at Ground Zero in NYC and saw how lives can be changed when community members come together around shared goals. Thank you to all of those who continue to step up today in service to your communities. #UnitedWeStand We will #NeverForget our fellow citizens and first responders who lost their lives on this day, 17 years ago, and the immeasurable courage and sacrifice displayed by everyday heroes in the face of such evil. May God be with all their families and our nation. https://t.co/aVM3WFEtC4 I'm joining my colleagues to call for a swift, bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA helps save lives in SW WA, ensures survivors have access to the resources they need, &amp; helps prevent future victims of violence. Proud to work in a bipartisan manner to improve care for children of low-income families who rely on Medicaid. Read more about our bill, the ACE Kids Act. https://t.co/o5Jg9CGjpO *Wages rose at the fastest rate since mid-2009; average hourly private-sector earnings were up 2.9% over the previous year.
*201,000 new jobs in U.S.
*Unemployment rate is 3.9%. 

I’ll keep supporting solutions that spur economic well-being for Southwest Washington residents. The August #JobsReport brought great news – particularly the data showing that worker paychecks are growing https://t.co/0olMlF2uDJ Honored to join my Senate counterparts yesterday as we worked on one of our Appropriations bills. I’m working to secure significant funding for the VA that will upgrade services and care for Southwest Washington veterans at the Portland VA facility. https://t.co/5THaGoIPWT This development for organ donors will help save lives, and I’m extremely proud to have helped play a part. I’ll continue to work to remove barriers that prevent people in Southwest Washington from getting life-saving medical care. https://t.co/6B7oGMQN3E We’ve all experienced the impacts of substance abuse and addiction on our family and friends. I recently took another step in Congress to make our Southwest Washington communities safer and healthier. Read more here: https://t.co/QFUjaI0U8d Organ donations save lives, save Medicare millions of $$ and cut costs across the health care system, which means it helps meet my goal of delivering better health care to SW WA residents. I’m pleased to successfully protect job security for organ donors. https://t.co/uOVuUvBYWW Thank you, Lisa. I'm glad I was able to help a little during what must have been a very difficult time.

I wish each of you all the best on your new endeavors! https://t.co/fbV3RdEKLO It was an honor to attend the opening celebration of Meriwether Place in Vancouver Wednesday, where folks who have struggled with homelessness or behavioral-health challenges will now reside. Thank you again to all the partners that made this housing facility a reality! https://t.co/Iwm1g0vPWc RT @hospitals4kids: Thank you @HerreraBeutler for being a champion for kids and the #ACEKidsAct. Learn more about how this critical bill wi… Thank you for having me! Great meeting you all. https://t.co/5scKlbzLgj Had a great tour of Vancouver Toyota yesterday meeting some of the company’s employees &amp; chatting about the auto industry, economy &amp; some of the issues that matter to businesses like theirs. It was also exciting to see their expansion underway to add new technician &amp; admin jobs. https://t.co/sVVTJC1GOq There was nothing like the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) camp I recently visited in Chehalis back when I was a high school student. What a great opportunity for local high schoolers to be exposed to college-level learning early on. https://t.co/YQZtu9Qn4e https://t.co/DzaUxIEG4N Having the support of so many individuals, groups, researchers, fishing businesses— and tribes— has been critical to the momentum behind my bill to control sea lions that are ravaging our salmon populations. I hope we can get this bipartisan bill across the finish line very soon. Each year I have the honor of nominating a few outstanding individuals to our nation’s military service academies. I’m pleased to announce we are now accepting applications. For more info and to submit an application, visit my website here: https://t.co/j6ijmhFm0S https://t.co/dEUPoN97cI Until Oregon formally scraps their plan to toll I-5 and I-205 at the state line without providing a specific plan to benefit those who will pay, Washington commuters deserve to have a safeguard written into law that will protect them. Today I announced that I’m introducing legislation prohibiting any tolls at the Washington-Oregon state line without agreement from both states’ governors: https://t.co/bGYP7hjaEp It’s important HS students are exposed to a variety of career opps – including medicine &amp; science. It was great to see students in action (&amp; having a lot of fun) in Lewis Co, along w/ their guest @UWMedicine looking at the latest in biomedical research. https://t.co/n2DVLSiv0p https://t.co/N4A6XesszJ For updates on the fires around the region you can visit https://t.co/m5q85jmVKg ...in reducing the severity &amp; number of wildfires. Also, earlier this year Congress, w/ the enthusiastic support of the entire Pac. NW delegation, provided the US Forest Service with a fire funding fix that will allow them to stop having to raid their other funds to fight fires. Hot, dry weather &amp; overly dense trees have contributed to the growing intensity of catastrophic wildfires in our National Forests. Forest management that includes selective thinning, small regenerative harvests &amp; prescribed burns during the cool, wet months can all play a part... It’s hard to see our skies filled with smoke from the multiple wildfires burning around the region. The thousands of fire fighters who are working to battle the blazes to save lives and properties deserve our utmost thanks. “U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, has taken the lead in pointing out the unfairness of this idea, and other Washington officials have recently joined the chorus.” https://t.co/wZCkMTEDDS Thank you to the good work of Vancouver Housing Authority and their partners. https://t.co/9HxW8COksc ...&amp; are struggling with a behavioral or mental health disorder. Congress has an important role to play in supporting our communities &amp; I was pleased to recently support a funding increase for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits as we work to see more folks achieve independent living. With the homeless population surging in Clark County, it’s so great to see organizations &amp; folks caring for the vulnerable members of our community. I had the privilege Monday of visiting two new facilities in Vancouver specifically built to house those who don’t have a home... Even with all our differences, I’m encouraged I’ve gotten every single Dem. and Rep. congressional representative in WA pushing for my bipartisan bill to save our salmon runs. We must get this bill to control predatory sea lions across the finish line. https://t.co/ZRiIyiLNSY Pleased to join students from around SW WA at W.F. West High School’s STEM camp in Chehalis this week. What a treat to have @UWMedicine as the special guest and talk about regenerative medicine &amp; especially, its potential to regrow hearts. Incredible opportunity for all of us! https://t.co/Syhy64HVLM Southwest Washington residents benefit when they have more health care choices and can save on out-of-pocket medical expenses. I’m pleased to have supported legislation recently to lower health care for families: https://t.co/N1VI4oQ0T4 When homes near the Cowlitz River were threatened by erosion, I was able to push FEMA for emergency funds, and working with Lewis County and the Timberline Community, we’re hopeful several houses will now be protected. https://t.co/LSuOuGMPTd https://t.co/UZ3lPnungV Today we recognize those awarded the #PurpleHeart - our military service members wounded or killed while serving the U.S. Armed Forces.

Join my live tele-town hall on Aug 8 @ 5:25pm by signing up here: https://t.co/6Lc7MWohaI Southwest Washington residents continue to experience higher costs in order to access treatment and doctors they need – but I won’t resign to that as the status-quo. I voted last week on legislation to lower health care costs for seniors &amp; families https://t.co/PzpTvYWQGk https://t.co/ocYsh6v5Z2
Very thorough investigative reporting on this national crisis. @laura_ungar @USATODAY Now it’s time for Congress to act, which is why I'm hopeful my bipartisan bill to help prevent maternal deaths will be voted on soon in the U.S. House. Opioid abuse is affecting literally every community in SW WA. I’m pleased to have helped direct federal resources toward helping men &amp; women climb out of the pit of addiction &amp; get back to being productive members of their homes &amp; workplaces. https://t.co/AzG04PgQ3w
