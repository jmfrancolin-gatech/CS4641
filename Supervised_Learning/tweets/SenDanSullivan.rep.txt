@NFL He also served as the NFL's official "kid correspondent" at the big game. Great job, Camdyn! Because of his commitment to football, and the challenges he has playing in #Alaska, Camdyn won the @NFL PLAY 60 Super Kid contest and delivered the official game ball to the officiating crew just before kickoff at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. I was glad to recognize eight-year-old Juneau resident Camdyn Clancy on the Senate floor yesterday as our youngest-ever Alaskan of the Week. https://t.co/ajN3jLCZrF But he feels a sense of duty to lead the Justice Department in the right direction. America will be lucky to have him. I look forward to voting for his confirmation. Mr. Barr is a patriot. He didn’t have to take this job. He didn’t have to put his family through this process. Specifically, I made sure to invite him to Alaska and highlighted Alaska’s unique position under federal law, including ANCSA and ANILCA. We discussed his view of the Second Amendment, an incredibly important issue for our state. I had a detailed discussion with President Trump's nominee to serve as the next Attorney General, William Barr. I was very impressed with our conversation. https://t.co/eyyXBJ1K5d RT @EndPlasticWaste: Yesterday in DC, Alliance members gathered with @SenDanSullivan and @SenWhitehouse to discuss how we'll use our collec… RT @Phil_Mattingly: Alaskan of the Week update:

I believe that Mr. Bernhardt will be a great Secretary of the Interior for my state, and for our country. @DOIDepSec @Interior During his years of private practice and leadership positions at @Interior during both the Trump and Bush Administrations, he has gained a deep understanding of Alaska’s unique land issues – including ANILCA. .@DOIDepSec David Bernhardt is an excellent choice to be our next Secretary of the @Interior. He is a strong advocate for the goal of energy dominance, and will help facilitate Alaska’s role in that goal. @ANSEP_AK It was an honor to be on-hand for the celebration and to meet many of these inspiring young Alaskans. ANSEP is one incredible program that makes me optimistic for the future of our state. .@ANSEP_AK recently marked 24 years of pioneering work in delivering world-class science and math education to Alaska Native students. #STEM https://t.co/8rZcYPGFlM What a fun effort to send cadets and midshipman treats from home.

It was great to join the Alaska All-Academies Association and parents of Alaskans attending our nation’s military academies for their spring gift box gathering in Eagle River. https://t.co/XUnIrXIEse Democracy assistance, and institutes like @IRIglobal, are crucial in helping America face foreign policy challenges including rising authoritarianism &amp; global democratic backsliding. Helping the people of #Venezuela in their time of need is what democracy assistance is all about. The spirit of democracy is something that is shared by people all around the world. It is my hope that the people of #Venezuela reclaim a say in the future of their country. There is important bipartisan legislation being passed in Washington, like the BOLD For Alzheimer’s Infrastructure Act, that doesn’t make the headlines, but is so important for a state with a rapidly increasing aging population &amp; a parallel increase in Akns living with dementia. Thank you to Pamela Kelley and the team of employees and volunteers at the Alzheimers Resource Agency of Alaska for welcoming me on Friday. #EndAlz https://t.co/JY68CDgBJn @Norad_Northcom Our adversaries have turned their attention to the #Arctic and we have to be more prepared for the threats we face. #Alaska is behind you all the way.

The time is now for the people of Venezuela to determine their own destiny. DOJ’s indictment of Huawei for tech theft &amp; sanctions violations is just one more example of Chinese businesses unwilling to play by the rules. As Chairman of Commerce Subcommittee on Security, we will be conducting serious oversight of these Chinese threats to the U.S. economy. https://t.co/nKJPpFT2FL Today I addressed Alaskans about the bill I supported to immediately reopen parts of the federal govt, while also providing the room to continue negotiating border-security funding. https://t.co/DDbF0iRHcV Couldn’t agree more @ComdtUSCG. The @USCG puts their lives on the line every day for us. They’re the only branch of our armed forces not getting paid. Until we can reopen the govt we need to #PayOurHeroes now! https://t.co/mSBUx1pPsK @USCG I’m cautiously optimistic that they’ll do so, particularly if they hear from their constituents. So please let them know to #PayOurHeroes: https://t.co/J17OtE563u @USCG Unfortunately, Senate Democrats are currently holding up the Pay Our Coast Guard Act. Earlier this week, I once again spoke on the Senate floor about this issue, urging my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take up legislation to right this wrong. #PayOurHeroes We’ve been working hard to push legislation to ensure that members of @USCG get paid for the work they do during the partial shutdown. It’s only right. They are the only members of the military not getting paid for putting their lives on the line for us every day. #PayOurHeroes Alaska is the cornerstone of our nation’s missile defense &amp; as @POTUS said in his remarks, we can do more and we must do more to keep us safe. I have no doubt that our Alaskan Missile Defenders at Ft. Greely &amp; Clear AFS, who stand watch 24/7, 365 days a yr will help lead the way. The review solidifies the bipartisan progress the Congress has already made working with the Trump administration, and outlines a vision for the future – protecting us from more advanced ballistic missile threats from rogue nations like North Korea and Iran. I was pleased to be at the Pentagon yesterday when President Trump announced the Dept. of Defense's new Missile Defense Review — the first update to American missile defense policy since 2010. @USCG Even though day in &amp; day out, they risk their lives for us, members of the Coast Guard are the only members of our military who aren’t getting paid during this partial shutdown. That’s wrong and we should fix it now. Watch my speech HERE: https://t.co/unXcaKS09x Yesterday I took to the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to take up legislation that I, along with a bipartisian group of my colleagues, introduced that would ensure that the more than 41,000 active members and retirees of the @USCG be paid throughout the partial govt shutdown. Recognizing her very hard work &amp; unwavering commitment to America's energy &amp; nat. resource potential, @lisamurkowski’s committee colleagues again chose her to chair the ENR Committee —a committee vital to AK. Congrats Lisa! Here’s to more productive years for our state &amp; country! Tonight I wanted to spend a few minutes talking directly to Alaskans about the partial federal government shutdown and on the broader debate we’re having here in D.C. on the issue of border security. WATCH HERE: https://t.co/av5LxHaXap Our global network of alliances are critical to U.S. national and regional security -- especially in the Middle East. Glad to see the Administration moving to reaffirm commitment to allies in the region, including the Kurds and Israel. @GovDunleavy The Alaska Delegation will support this request with immediacy in Washington. Until then, Alaskans can apply for State Individual Assistance at https://t.co/rNB0lMBl46 Yesterday, @GovDunleavy requested a major disaster declaration for federal assistance following the Nov. 30 earthquake. Though Alaskans are resilient, approval of this declaration will do much to help those in need get back on their feet. Happy 60th birthday Alaska! Today we salute all who worked tirelessly so that we can benefit from all of our state’s wonders. We’ve got a lot of work to achieve the promises of statehood. But we have character, we have spirit, and we have each other! https://t.co/t9mOBlQ1jf Pleased to learn that the Egyptian courts acquitted employees of @IRIGlobal and other NGOs wrongfully convicted in the 2013 show trial of foreign organizations. Let's hope that this is a step toward a more open environment in Egypt. https://t.co/0XuzGrkrNX America is stronger and our military is more capable and lethal because of Secretary Mattis. And though he would never acknowledge it, history will one day record that Secretary Mattis was a once-in-a-generation Secretary of Defense. Semper Fidelis, Mr. Secretary. I would like to personally thank Secretary Mattis for his unwavering voice on the importance of allies, his resolute dedication to rebuilding our under-resourced military, and inspiring the next generation of American warriors who wear our nation’s uniform. I’m disheartened by the impending resignation of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. His decades of service to our nation – from a Marine Corps second lieutenant to our 26th Secretary of Defense – embodies all that makes this country truly great.

Thank you for all the well wishes and kind words following my very unexpected appendectomy yesterday. I’m doing well and feel very fortunate to have my wife Julie by my side. There have been a number of questions raised today regarding a protest in and directly outside of my Washington, D.C. office in opposition to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Given the attention this has received, I believe it warrants a response.

https://t.co/3n6WY6dyjP https://t.co/RN0bPMMqtC As I’ve stated over and over again, the federal government must do more in this critical area. Today we made important progress towards supporting those on the front lines and helping combat the scourge of drug abuse and addiction. Last year, more than 72,000 Americans, including a number of Alaskans, died from drug overdoses  -- the highest rate ever. Today, my colleagues and I in the Senate overwhelmingly passed milestone legislation to further combat the opioid crisis and help some of the most vulnerable in our communities. Allegations of sexual assault should be taken seriously. Professor Ford &amp; Judge Kavanaugh deserve right to be heard on this matter. I commend Chairman Grassley on committing to as much &amp; will be following closely as these claims are evaluated &amp; reviewed. https://t.co/2z5NphTUpE The length and the renewal are unprecedented and are the result of the hard work from the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.

WATCH HERE: https://t.co/TcWPKjqa8V #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave 3) To get ideas from members of the community on how to fight crime. (4) Have federal officials hear about how, despite our challenges, there are amazing examples of people all across AK working in their communities to try to keep us all safe. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave So today we organized this summit with four goals in mind: (1)To bring federal, state and local officials together to coordinate efforts. (2) To paint a picture for the federal officials here about the unique challenges that we face here in Alaska in countering drug trafficking. The vast majority of this is fueled by the drug epidemic. But here is the good news. We are Alaskans. We are tough, we are resilient and we innovative. There is no doubt in my mind that we can conquer this. Its critical to remember that behind these statistics and numbers is a personal story of a fellow Alaskan and their family of heartbreak, tragedy, sorrow and anger. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave In the last 5 years the murder rate in Alaska is up 79%. Rape is up 16%. Assault is up 36%. Robbery is up 52%. Vehicle theft is up 150%. Burglary is up 42%. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave Nearly every day I hear from Alaskans about cars stolen and houses broken into. Shootings on our streets. Just days ago the Alaska Dept. of Safety put out their annual crime report. The numbers are staggering. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave Today we are focused not only on our addiction epidemic, but on drug trafficking and the associated crime wave that is victimizing so many Alaskans. We took the ideas from people in the audience and we put them to action. This summit, the Alaska Wellness Summit 2.0: Confronting Alaska’s Crime Wave, is a follow up to that. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave Many of you here attended that summit and are still contributing significantly to the ongoing discussion. In D.C., we also continue to be very focused on this issue, passing numerous bills that will bring more resources for treatment and mental health services. Federal officials from several different agencies attended to hear the many obstacles Alaskans face seeking recovery, as well as witness the indomitable spirit of Alaskans who have overcome those obstacles. The turnout surprised all of us. Countless Alaskans showed to listen, gain inspiration, learn and exchange ideas. 2 yrs ago, I had the honor of convening the Alaska Wellness Summit: Conquering the Opioid Crisis, an important gathering of federal, state &amp; local community leaders dedicated to tackling the many challenges associated with the growing opioid epidemic. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave #ConfrontingAKCrimeWive

https://t.co/dlmHm8D9zD Looking forward to welcoming so many of you for AK Wellness Summit #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave -- important gathering focused on issues of crime impacting our state &amp; communities. If you can't attend in person, tune in live at https://t.co/TcWPKjqa8V or on my FB or website. https://t.co/bZS4d3Qcrn I look forward to Chief Doll's participation in our upcoming #WellnessSummit focused on confronting the crime wave that's victimizing so many Alaskans, &amp; hearing from him and other prominent community leaders about how together we can overcome our public safety challenges. https://t.co/rS8VmYugMD On Friday, I had the opportunity to meet with @APDInfo Chief Justin Doll to discuss many issues, including those related to crime, public safety and efforts being taken to keep Alaskans safe -- issues that get raised with me often when meeting with Alaskans. https://t.co/tWXbXUuxMZ This week I had the opportunity to visit Sweet Caribou and Uncle Leroy's Coffee, two Anchorage small businesses putting out some excellent products and having a real impact on their community. I look forward to coming back for some more "Alaska-style" macarons &amp; gourmet coffee. https://t.co/z3BbSVg5uj During my travels, I always try to stop in and visit with some of Alaska's many small businesses to hear firsthand from them and see their remarkable entrepreneur spirit. For the first time ever, the NDAA includes an authorization of up to six heavy, polar-class icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard – something that is long overdue. https://t.co/4UNxZGyEH0 https://t.co/RvJ5o06cS0 Glad to see of Carl Perkins CTE reauth signed into law -- so important for school districts &amp; students across the country. It provides critical funding for innovative CTE programs, while giving states &amp; school districts flexibility to educate next gen of high-skilled workers. https://t.co/anNAzRZmYP Great to join @USChamber to discuss potential of Indo-Pacific region and opportunities for continued U.S. economic engagement with friends and allies. https://t.co/7etpEFP9cx Sen. Ted Stevens stands in a league of his own in terms of dedication and contribution to the state of Alaska. He would want us to enjoy the Greatland as much as he did. So get out and play Alaska! #TedStevensDay https://t.co/TTSvzTnlQz As our intelligence agencies have informed us, Russia tried to interfere in our elections and the elections of our allies across the globe. We need to take measures to prevent this from happening again and to continue to hold Russia accountable. I disagree w/ President’s remarks following Helsinki Summit. Specifically, do I believe the professional and patriotic men and women of our intelligence community, including the Director of National Intelligence, or a mafia regime leader like Putin? It’s not even a close call. Today, after a very constructive meeting, I announced my intention to support Judge Brett Kavanaugh as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I believe he has the qualities Alaskans will value on the Supreme Court. See my full statement:
https://t.co/67Va28BGAs https://t.co/wfm5rd4S3b Kikkan Randall has the admiration of a whole state behind her as she undertakes her battle against cancer. No doubt she’ll tackle this challenge with the same grace and internal fire that’s made her a champion for the ages. We’re all pulling for you @kikkanimal! https://t.co/ZcwgkZE19w @realDonaldTrump They know this, which is why for decades they have tried to split up our successful alliances. Don’t let them. Good Luck! .@realDonaldTrump -- Mr. President, as you head to Europe, remember that one of America’s most important and enduring strategic advantages is that we are an ally rich nation, and our adversaries (N. Korea, Iran, Russia) and potential adversaries (China) are ally poor. My statement on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court:
https://t.co/7Hd7Dx5kEp https://t.co/H1lOfk5UrG Hey @Newseum - thanks for the great exhibit &amp; for featuring the powerful photo of Bob Thom, known in Alaska as 'Cajun Bob' one of the many heroes who live in my state. For all: Please visit the Newseum and check out the #MarinesandTet exhibit! https://t.co/bW78M7Dy1b I would like to thank Justice Kennedy for his years of service to our nation and for his unwavering commitment to civility. I wish him and his family the very best in their future endeavors.

https://t.co/9MdxTi5pBt Honored #SecDef Mattis accepted my invitation to visit AK to meet our remarkable men &amp; women in uniform &amp; see firsthand a number of our military assets &amp; missions. Extremely valuable visit, one that allowed #SecDef to gain more robust understanding of AK geostrategic location https://t.co/oVfci4b5V6 Hats off the men and women of the USCGC Alex Haley, homeported in Kodiak, for their steadfast work to intercept and detain this vessel suspected of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. 
https://t.co/lhUsi3reKk Honored to host #SecDef Mattis in Interior Alaska to highlight a number of important missions and military assets, including air combat capabilities at Eielson AFB and America's missile defense at Ft. Greely https://t.co/MLPnyrs5T5 Yesterday, I traveled to AK w/ #SecDef Jim Mattis to begin a 2 day tour to show him firsthand how AK constitutes 3 pillars of military might: cornerstone of  missile defense, hub of air combat for Asia Pacific, vital  platform for expeditionary forces. Stayed tuned! https://t.co/B1mjaXzTFu While @POTUS has now addressed family separation administratively, it’s important to recognize these types of ‘executive fixes’ to our immigration laws are often temporary &amp; not sustainable. A bipartisan, enduring solution by Congress is needed. My stmnt

https://t.co/pXIvGUP3rs Senate-passed NDAA continues the process of rebuilding our military, in addition to recognizing that AK's military capabilities play an important role in our national defense as global threats increase. 
https://t.co/U3UjorJIuq https://t.co/6XxV3RVBWB Senate-passed NDAA contains provision stating the removal of U.S. forces from the Korea Peninsula “is a non-negotiable item as it relates to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization” of North Korea. Glad to see @WSJopinion agreed
https://t.co/olTd8SXF4C In addition to historic opening of ANWR, Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act is having a huge impact on the American economy, including job creation, economic growth, higher wages &amp; reductions to utility rates -- something @JuneauEmpire   highlighted in this recent piece
https://t.co/3KW8V45bXj .@WSJ Editorial Board piece -- "The Senate's Nuclear Insurance" in support of my missile defense provision within the FY19 NDAA, describes the important next steps we need to take to further strengthen our national security. Have a read -- https://t.co/HtB8BAysKE
