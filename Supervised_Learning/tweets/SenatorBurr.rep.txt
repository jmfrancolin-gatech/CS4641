Not just because it preserves our beautiful outdoors for the next generation, but because it helps protect our communities today. #SaveLWCF After #HurricaneSandy, wetlands like the LWCF-funded Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey saved an estimated $650 million in damages. #LWCF funds create beautiful spaces that double as critical infrastructure. #SaveLWCF For instance, the natural green spaces and parks that wind through Charlotte aren't just there for their looks. The Four Mile Creek Greenway also absorbs rain drainage, slowing it down and doubling as a flood control. #SaveLWCF North Carolinians have more on their minds today than recreation, as we contend with the terrible damage inflicted by #HurricaneFlorence.

Americans support the program and want it to continue. Yet for some reason, the Senate still refuses to take up this issue. Conservation programs, like #LWCF, plan generations ahead and need security to do their work effectively. This solution provides that, while ensuring Congress is still in the driver’s seat. This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It would permanently reauthorize #LWCF, but give Congress the chance to hold a vote of disapproval every 3 years. If the disapproval vote passes, it ends authorization. Today, I asked the Senate to take up a bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund before it expires next month. #LWCF is critical for preserving our national parks and waters for future generations - and uses NO taxpayer funds. https://t.co/TLGrsLlDbc WATCH: Senator Burr Live on Senate Floor Pushing for #LWCF Vote https://t.co/EwMA9cTYEI Senator @MarkWarner and I released the following statement today on Michael Cohen’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee: https://t.co/0UyEP21qkI My statement on former @CIA Director John Brennan’s recent comments: https://t.co/r5Cy3VYmRF RT @CNN: "People with disabilities in America are still extraordinarily underemployed and more likely to be out of the workforce" write @Se… .@SenBobCasey and I wrote this weekend about how we can get more Americans with disabilities working. They are more than willing and ready - and the ABLE Act can help. https://t.co/yGZBN6ueRe The number of emotional support animals has spiked in the last year and @Delta has had 6 incidents with dog bites in the last 60 days. Enough is enough. We need to protect veterans and others with disabilities and their fellow passengers at the same time. https://t.co/n903DdwCwj The @HBCUCaucus #DiversityInTech Summit aims to improve recruitment and retention of #HBCU graduates looking to enter tech. As home to more HBCUs than any other state, North Carolina is the perfect place to hold today’s inaugural summit! https://t.co/ToaVK6CZHF Foreign influence ops using social media -&amp; our own rights &amp; freedoms- to weaken us from within represents an intolerable assault on the democratic foundation this republic was built on. We cannot afford ineffective half-measures, let alone doing nothing. https://t.co/QmEEvtufOV HAPPENING NOW: Senate Intel Committee holds open hearing on foreign influence operations’ use of social media platforms. Watch live here: https://t.co/ZiAhiLQ6Zk Looking forward to discussing the issue further at tomorrow’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, featuring third-party social media experts. Live streaming Wed. @ 9:30am here: https://t.co/ZiAhiLQ6Zk I am glad to see that Facebook is taking a much-needed step toward limiting the use of their platform by foreign influence campaigns. The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division. https://t.co/Fzwr1QFfG0 The U.S. economy grew at 4.1 percent from April to June, the fastest rate in nearly 4 years. More signs that “the second-longest expansion on record isn’t yet running out of fuel." https://t.co/9MAIwonYE9 #TaxCutsandJobsAct Yesterday, I honored C.D. “Dick” Spangler on the Senate floor. He was a great North Carolinian and former President of the @UNC_System. Our prayers are with his wife of 58 years, Meredith, and his family. https://t.co/mXiqLVKp57 https://t.co/MWIIJOd80Y I joined Sen. @MarkWarner today to thank the brave men and women of the US Intel Community. Every day, Intel professionals risk their lives to keep our homeland safe. They do so without credit or thanks, but knowing their work is vital for our defense. https://t.co/KRGSMnh8T9 HAPPENING NOW: Senator Burr on the Senate floor calling on Congress to #SaveLWCF, America's most successful conservation program: https://t.co/UtlA7jUDu6 VADM Maguire and Ms. McCarthy are two highly qualified candidates who have committed their lives to service. I’m confident their leadership of NCTC &amp; State Dept’s INR will benefit the Intel Community and the defense of our country. https://t.co/2KEw0vMzgt My opening statement for today’s Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing: https://t.co/9EdXgd68qG LIVE NOW: Senate Intel confirmation hearing for 2 key Intel positions: Dir. of National Counterterrorism Center and Asst. Sect of State for Intel &amp; Research: https://t.co/KVIxqApG3i “In nearly every congressional district, #LWCF helped set up… playgrounds, sports fields, picnic sites, community recreation centers and hiking trails. The Grand Canyon, the Appalachian Trail and Central Park have all benefited.” #SaveLWCF https://t.co/Xhv3K8VfmD https://t.co/T8JURlJdJP New study in WI finds the Land and Water Conservation Fund is popular with folks of every political party - 86% support our nation’s most important conservation program. Yet another reason Congress should #SaveLWCF! https://t.co/zzduWvvZLX North Carolina added 13k jobs last month, and more than 100k in the last year for a low jobless rate of 4.2 percent. These numbers mean real money in the pockets of real North Carolinians. https://t.co/CgMHHZK0TF Congrats to @SpecialOlympics on its 50th Anniversary this year! In 1968, six North Carolinians participated in the 1st @SpecialOlympics in Chicago. Now, there are 40,000 Special Olympians in NC alone. I wish everyone in this year's Games the best of luck, and go @SONC_BeAFan! https://t.co/PtYwrdziQD Next Wed. @ 9:30 ➡️ Senate Intel to hold open confirmation hearing for 2 key Intel positions: Dir. of National Counterterrorism Center and Asst. Sect of State for Intel &amp; Research: https://t.co/KVIxqApG3i Jobless claims are the lowest in nearly a half-century. And with unemployment rates at historic lows, too, the signs keep pointing toward the strongest economy in decades thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. https://t.co/efd5UCN2Vc Vladimir Putin is not our friend and never has been. Nor does he want to be our friend. His regime’s actions prove it. https://t.co/W95VPf9T8Y In most workplaces in America, failing to do your job means you lose your job. This bill ensures the IRS can hold high-level officials accountable in the same way, and it's long overdue. https://t.co/PSnFzD2c7R Civil rights crimes like Emmett Till’s brutal murder are exactly the reason @RepJohnLewis and I authored legislation to encourage @TheJusticeDept to reinvestigate these cold cases. Every American has a right to justice, none more so than Emmett Till. https://t.co/aCO48l47vv This unique watershed is home to some of the world's most endangered species and is continuously at risk from poachers and traffickers. Thanks to @SenRobPortman and @SenatorTomUdall for their leadership on the DELTA Act. You can find more info here: https://t.co/wlT4AzUH4U
