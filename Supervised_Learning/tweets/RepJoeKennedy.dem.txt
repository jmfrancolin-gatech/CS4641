Please SHARE this far and wide to make sure your neighbors #GetCovered! https://t.co/UY0AHyUWPJ House GOP should really just quit while they’re behind and hand over the gavel. https://t.co/EA9fnR2M0R At every turn this country continues to penalize and criminalize poverty. In our courts and our jails, our streets and exam rooms, our safety net and our schools. The poor are punished for what the rich get away with scot-free. https://t.co/qEqAAnDQNR A crisis of maternal mortality —particularly one entrenched and exacerbated along racial lines — is unacceptable in the most advanced nation on earth. Proud to see our bipartisan Preventing Maternal Deaths Act led by @RepDianaDeGette and @HerreraBeutler pass the House today. https://t.co/DLT2LUqONP Told by our justice system that his Administration must reunite families they have separated, @realDonaldTrump instead breaks them even further. We will spend decades treating the scars he has inflicted on these kids - and our country. https://t.co/xGPbuGDiPr RT @HRC: The Trump-Pence administration has made dangerous attempts to ban trans troops, erode protections for trans students and workers a… This generation will either be defined by the wreckage of climate change or defined by the mighty effort we summon in response. We no longer have the luxury of time, patience or incrementalism. That’s why I’m proud to support the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/IKkb8fKuQO Few American communities have been spared the violence of racism, hatred &amp; bigotry this year. That’s why we must unequivocally reject white nationalism in all forms – threatened, written, verbal, or physical – and restore decency and justice in its place. https://t.co/XjkxQxj7rW Christopher Roy is a hero who sacrificed everything to protect his neighbors and his community. To his family and his daughter Ava, our Commonwealth mourns with you and will never forget his memory. https://t.co/SdyAgv2AKy We're wrapping up our 3rd #Tour34 tomorrow with office hours for Norfolk, Milford, Hopedale and Medway. Please click here for times and locations - see you there! https://t.co/K93QyFfgJF TOMORROW, we’re holding our 3rd annual Service Fair at Newton City Hall from 1-3PM. Stop by to learn more about getting involved in your neighborhood! https://t.co/2yf5Dt7RUK As National Grid and its workers return to the negotiating table tomorrow, I urge the company to change course and make a strong, clear stand for the livelihood of their workforce. (4/4) I applaud the leadership of @SpeakerDeLeo and @RepTonyCabral in stepping up for Massachusetts workers and making it clear their government has their back. I encourage the Senate and Governor Baker to follow suit. (3/4) While that choice is theirs to make, they should be held financially accountable for its impact. (2/4) Weaponizing critical worker benefits to gain contract concessions has become a too common and toxic corporate practice. National Grid chose to lock out their workers, at great expense to the impacted employees, their families, and our entire Commonwealth. (1/4) https://t.co/tDGXfER7fR As FERC commissioner, Bernard McNamee will choose fossil fuels over the future of our planet every time. His record made that abundantly clear. GOP Senate voted to confirm him today anyways. Now, let's remember the name of every Senator who chose to follow his path. https://t.co/rCkwzTGvt6 Reversing these historic trends requires American leadership. If @realDonaldTrump continues to insist on American retreat, a Democratic Congress must step up and Mitch McConnell cannot stand in our way. https://t.co/msakkR21AN This isn’t just Scott Walker’s legacy, but a microcosm of GOP’s national priorities. Denied access to the doctor’s office. Barriers to the ballot box. CEO &amp; corporate profits at the expense of workers’ rights. Unabashed, unashamed tribalism. #WIPowerGrab https://t.co/1EzVCMCEe2 RT @BetoORourke: So great to join @RepJoeKennedy to spend some time with  @KimsMom3 and @MarcelMcClinton and Tyler who says “it’s nice to g… RT @CREDOMobile: Same page, @RepJoeKennedy.

So are the people you serve and every single other country on earth. We must #ActOnClimate today. https://t.co/oq0JaEm0tB A GOP operative in NC tries to undercut an election. A GOP legislature in WI tries to undermine election results. Yet, a simple misunderstanding sends a woman with a green card to prison for 8 years for voting. You tell me what’s a greater threat to our democracy. In this nation of immigrants, we don't judge those arriving at our shores by the amount of money in their pocket or the color of their skin. We need you to reject the Trump Admin's most recent attack on immigrants and say #NoToPublicCharge here: https://t.co/abMvv863Ba Happy Hanukkah to the families and friends gathered together on this first night. May your celebration be peaceful and joyful! #HappyHanukkah George H.W. Bush’s life was one of service and sacrifice. He was the very definition of a public servant and a man dedicated to his family.  All of us strive to match those same values. Our thoughts are with the Bush family today. Doctors want nothing more than to find an exit from our nation's ever expanding gun violence lane. Too many have been forced to tell parents their child was taken by a bullet. Please take a few minutes to read this heartbreaking, thoughtful piece by @MGHSurgery's @peter_masiakos. https://t.co/aThRXSG3PJ No better snapshot of our current, toxic capitalism than this: GM shareholders went to bed this week with $10.6B the company has spent on buybacks since ‘15. GM workers went to bed unsure if jobs &amp; livelihoods would be there tomorrow. https://t.co/K9GFvRuIBu This will be the @realDonaldTrump’s legacy. Asking our next generation to sacrifice today &amp; tomorrow. Lost health care today. Medicare tomorrow. Education today. Student loan interest tomorrow. A clean climate today. And a clean climate tomorrow. This is why we fight back. https://t.co/iVWsz0LBDd Charles Johnson IV is turning unimaginable loss into real change. This is not an easy story to watch. But it’s a necessary confrontation with the appalling racial injustices in our country’s system of maternal health. @4kira4moms #maternaljustice https://t.co/BWlDacVOni Couldn’t agree more. Moral capitalism only works if govt demands it - living wages, labor protections, anti-trust, corporate oversight, tax code, civil rights, family policy, education, the list goes on. Grateful for the work you’ve done to light the way. It’s on us now. https://t.co/i9PStmpfoX RT @BostonGlobe: US Representative Joe Kennedy is urging his fellow Democrats to adopt a new economic ideology — what he’s calling ‘‘moral… To his family, as well as the families of Capt. Andrew Ross and Staff Sgt. Dylan Elchin, we are heartbroken for your loss. A grateful nation mourns by your side. Words cannot adequately describe the mark Sergeant First Class Eric Michael Emond left on our country, our Commonwealth, and his community. His memory and sacrifice will forever be cherished and celebrated. https://t.co/b19sp08s1S With or without a gavel, @NancyPelosi is a fearless force for good. I was honored to nominate her to take that gavel back next year. https://t.co/brP0XUDfnK With ‘surgical precision’ Thomas Farr attempted to illegally silence black voters. This man doesn’t belong in public service and he certainly doesn’t deserve the robes of a federal judge. We must #StopFarr. Equity. A decent standard of living in the richest nation on earth. An economy that rewards all who labor for its success. A system that protects those at the bottom instead of insulating those at the top. A country where the average family can do more than just scrape by. https://t.co/QJHZNCxoj1 I visited this facility. I talked to kids held there for months on end precisely because of exhaustive/inefficient fingerprinting system @realDonaldTrump has imposed on would-be sponsors offering a loving home. https://t.co/JQsYEMIin2 Centuries after welcoming the first pilgrims to their shores, the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe must still fight for their native land. A poignant reminder in the wake of Thanksgiving. https://t.co/ROid71SVw8 This news is not just the result of one company’s choices. It’s the result of a system that has loosened the terms of its social contract 1000 times, 1000 ways over the past 50 years - time and again freeing corporations from their responsibilities to those who sweat for them. https://t.co/m8tuGkE43D 14,000 loyal GM employees will clock out tonight to an uncertain future. Meanwhile GM’s stock soars, benefiting shareholders and shareholders alone. Our nation deserves a better capitalism - a moral capitalism - that rewards workers for the success they help build. https://t.co/5b1886O4a4 The terrified children and families in these photos aren't just caught in the crossfire of @realDonaldTrump’s immigration policies. They are the targets of @realDonaldTrump’s immigration policies. That's the point. https://t.co/Q2tHzALJtp In this country we meet asylum seekers with our laws, not our weapons. https://t.co/bYNcpGXhdi Any transgender man or woman defending our nation should be met with nothing but admiration and respect. Our justice system should stand strong against our commander-in-chief's attempts to inject injustice and bigotry into our military. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/mnTIa1SYXG
