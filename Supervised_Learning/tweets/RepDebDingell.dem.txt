One year ago, the FCC repealed #NetNeutrality rules. Millions of Americans raised their voices to fight for a fair and open internet. Time is running out - we must keep up the fight for #NetNeutrality starting with the CRA discharge petition to force a vote on the House Floor! https://t.co/xpt5HZAsM3 RT @USProgressives: TOMORROW is the last day to enroll in health insurance for 2019!

Now it is even clearer that the Trump Administration's proposal on fuel economy standards was designed to help one group - Big Oil.

This is just the first of many much-needed reforms to ensure that workplaces across the country are safe and inclusive for all workers. Everyone should work in a safe and supportive environment. For too many people, earning a living also includes harassment or discrimination. Now it‚Äôs the House‚Äôs turn to debate and consider ending US military involvement in Yemen. https://t.co/T15nFv3PEY People are starving, homes have been bombed, diseases ‚Äì including a cholera epidemic ‚Äì are rampant, and too many have been lost to a reckless Saudi-led aerial bombing campaign. Congress has a moral responsibility to end the war in Yemen. For the third time, the House has shut down debate by quietly sneaking it into a procedural vote. Today, House members received an update from military and diplomatic officials. Families in my hometown are telling me about horrific conditions. The ongoing war in Yemen has caused endless suffering and is a serious humanitarian crisis. The decision to send the military to war is perhaps one of Congress‚Äô greatest responsibilities. The Senate is having the debate the House should also be having. My heart goes out to Jessica's family and everyone at @Fox2News.
