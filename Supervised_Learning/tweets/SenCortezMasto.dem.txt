That's why I'll continue working with colleagues from both sides to do what we were sent here to do: find common ground to improve the lives of our constituents. He was unyielding in his demand for American taxpayers to pay billions to build a wall he promised Mexico would pay for, and he failed to reassure federal workers that their lives wouldn’t be thrown into chaos by another government shutdown. President Trump painted a picture of an America with more pessimism than promise. Instead of bringing us together, he doubled down on the same old divisive rhetoric and once again sought to pit neighbors against each other. I'm committed to getting answers on how this plutonium was shipped, when it will be removed &amp; keeping any future shipments from ever being sent to Nevada without our knowledge.

Let that sink in. I saw firsthand at the border how this Administration engaged in their inhumane family separation policy. This has been happening since 2017 and they don’t even know the true number of families separated. I’ll be fighting like hell to get answers.

Let’s do our jobs. Let’s show the American people that Congress can govern. This week, @GovSisolak sent a letter to @NSHE asking them to assist students affected by the shutdown. I'm thankful for his advocacy on behalf of students across the state. Looking forward to tuning in to his State of the State address tonight.

We can't abdicate our role as coequal branch of gov't to satisfy the President's whims.

Proud to cosponsor @SenJohnThune’s bipartisan legislation that will ensure members of @USCG get their paychecks now &amp; during future gov't shutdowns. It’s time for @senatemajldr to stop sitting on his hands and do the job he was elected to do. We can vote today to end this shutdown. And if the President vetoes it, we vote again and override the veto. That’s our system of gov't, and it works when our politicians allow it to. https://t.co/7cS7YWV7Fm The ball is firmly in @senatemajldr’s court. But rather than taking up the House-passed legislation, he is watching from the sidelines as this shutdown continues. He’s holding up the legislative process to satisfy the President’s whims. The House has already passed bipartisan legislation – H.R. 21 and House Joint Resolution 1 – to end this shutdown, reopen shuttered agencies and fund the Department of Homeland Security through February 8th. @senatemajldr has the power to bring that legislation up for a vote. Federal workers aren’t leverage. They’re the men and women who serve our communities and provide vital services to Americans. They aren’t enjoying a paid vacation, as one White House adviser callously put it. They’re paying the price for the President’s govern-by-chaos approach. Brianna told me that without their sole source of income, her family would struggle to make ends meet. She’s weighing the decision to pull her daughter out of school to move in with her parents until her husband is able to provide again. Last week, I heard from Brianna, a stay-at-home mom and Coast Guard military spouse. As a Coast Guardsman, her husband must report to work without pay for the duration of this shutdown. https://t.co/odJNcU2lym RT @WCKitchen: Hitting the lunch rush! #ChefsForFeds have already served hundreds of hot + hearty lunches to those impacted by the governme… RT @SenatorDurbin: Stood with @SenateDems today to tell President Trump enough is enough – end this hurtful and unnecessary shutdown. https… Correction: Democrats' strategy is to do our jobs, as mandated by Article I of the Constitution.

WATCH live here: https://t.co/E7WhGHVmTn Too many families are already struggling to make ends meet because of the #TrumpShutdown and in one month nearly 500,000 Nevadans on food stamps could lose benefits if it continues. @realDonaldTrump &amp; @senatemajldr do your jobs and end this shutdown now. 

https://t.co/Xwz6AiOSq5 In a time of anxiety for so many hardworking families in Nevada affected by the shutdown, acts of kindness can make all the difference. Thank you to Nevadans for rallying together and helping those in need. 

https://t.co/ANY65hOOkl Sparks now has 3 fire stations equipped with emergency medical services with the approval of paramedic level EMS at Fire Station 3 on East Greg Street. I applaud the Sparks City Council for approving the addition of this life-saving service. Wildfires are becoming more dangerous and threatening more communities in Nevada and around the country. If the shutdown continues, critical programs for prevention and training will be on hold, risking people's lives. Joined @SenJeffMerkley to bring awareness to this issue. https://t.co/Kdy9KipSph Once upon a time, @senatemajldr believed in a functioning Senate.
 
“Remember me? I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns,” he said.
 
https://t.co/XzeeGUats6 Article I of the Constitution offers a clear mandate for Congress on how we do our job as senators. We cannot abdicate our role as a coequal branch of government to satisfy the whims of @realDonaldTrump.
