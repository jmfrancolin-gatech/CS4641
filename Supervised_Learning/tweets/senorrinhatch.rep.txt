But the Senate does not don't pass legislation we know is unconstitutional, violating the separation of powers, just to make people feel better. That's not what we're here for.

So either the ABA is not the "gold standard" or Dems are back to games over judges. @FigZayas You don't have to, the ABA thinks very highly of his character. The ABA, which Democrats consider the "gold standard, rated Farr "Well Qualified" their highest assessment.  

That designation means they believe he has the "highest reputation for integrity; and demonstrates the capacity for sound judicial temperament." https://t.co/EqHfx2mhMN Today we will hold a procedural vote on Thomas Farr to be a U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina.

Most of what you've heard from the left about Thomas Farr is utterly false character assassination nonsense. Which is what we've come to expect on judges. https://t.co/tCYLfNyk1E We have confirmed qualified Judges this Congress at a historic pace.
