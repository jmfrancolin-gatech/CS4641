Yet they still only make 80 cents to every dollar paid to men, and the disparity is even worse for women of color.

Today @PattyMurray, @MarkWarner and I are re-introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act to try to close that gap. On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we remember the millions killed, including 6 million Jews. Not just to honor them, but also to ensure that atrocities in our history are never repeated. These crimes against humanity are unspeakable‚Äîbut speak of them we must, in order to learn from them. Make no mistake, federal employees standing strong‚Äîespecially our air safety professionals‚Äîwas key to ending the shutdown. We owe an apology and thanks to all who suffered through the #TrumpShutdown. And to think he said he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù to do it!   You can‚Äôt close the USA. @13DavidAlan Hey David - Congress passed our bill to pay federal employees back and I‚Äôve introduced one to do the same for federal contractors. Millions of Americans can breathe again. Like them, I'm relieved. But both parties must now work to reach a long-term compromise‚Äîand ensure no one can ever again hold public servants hostage by using a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic. Never. Again. Why is our country treating people like this? Oh, right ‚Äî because the president can‚Äôt get his way. https://t.co/VKk4wjOFL0 Today is the second missed paycheck for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. There‚Äôs no quippy tweet that can address this. We‚Äôre facing a mind-boggling humanitarian disaster, and it‚Äôs entirely man-made. I just voted to end the shutdown and provide relief to millions of Americans. Deeply disappointed more of my Republican colleagues didn‚Äôt support reopening government as we negotiate a compromise. We *must* stay in session this weekend so both parties can work on a path forward. Mr. President: A novel idea for you... End the shutdown today and give the speech as scheduled! https://t.co/VngIYU3TwV Just to be clear: I will keep trying to reopen the government until I'm blue in the face. (And then some.) https://t.co/EPXOnAAEMn Shutting down the government is not a negotiating tool. 

People's lives are not leverage. 

If we give in to that kind of tactic, using Americans' lives and livelihoods as leverage, we can be sure the president will turn to it again and again‚Äîevery time he doesn't get his way.

While he is no longer with us, his legacy, his example, and his wisdom continue to this very day. So right now let's look back at some words of his that are particularly resonant today. In September of 1964, he spoke near the Berlin Wall‚Äîa wall built smack in the center of Berlin, separating west from east to keep people divided from one another. This is what he said: https://t.co/9smMXRgxLh If you turn on the TV right now, you're more likely to hear the words ‚Äúwall‚Äù or ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù than ‚Äújustice‚Äù or ‚Äúdream.‚Äù On a day when we ought to be reflecting about the dreams Dr. King had, we‚Äôre instead talking about the 31st day of shutdown and the hatred that compels it.

Impossible to overstate exactly how ridiculous and offensive ‚Äî not to mention unnecessary ‚Äî this continuing shutdown is. I gotta say, trying to take a long weekend off while our people all around the country are suffering... it's intolerable. You want to go home? Vote! 

We can reopen the government *right now* and fix this mess. Virginia would be the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment - the deciding number to finally add this to the Constitution. Today, we're one step closer!

This shutdown is squeezing the finances of so many Americans, including thousands of federal workers who live in Virginia. As leaders, we can‚Äôt just whistle past the graveyard of this crisis. This nation ‚Äì the greatest nation on earth ‚Äì looks like a laughingstock because the President‚Äôs fragile ego is leading him to shut everything down to get his way. It‚Äôs a temper tantrum more befitting a playpen than the Oval Office. We‚Äôve gone from Mexico paying for the wall to threatening thousands of federal workers that they may be furloughed or work without pay for YEARS if taxpayers don‚Äôt pay for the wall. https://t.co/z3dw0hRyDd My New Year‚Äôs resolution is this phrase from the Senate oath of office I will take on January 3: ‚Äúsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù My gut tells me that those words will have unique significance in 2019.

The world is filled with millions seeking refuge, and we are all like innkeepers‚Äîlet us choose wisely in how we treat them. President Trump is gleefully punishing 800,000 of his own citizens by shutting down the government over the holidays. Virginia‚Äôs federal employees are so sick of this. 17 days ago, the military confirmed to me that there were no plans to change our strategy in Afghanistan.

By ignoring the advice of his military advisors, Trump‚Äôs incoherent decision-making threatens our troops as they conduct a hasty withdrawal in an uncertain environment. https://t.co/0UJ5xEnatg .@realDonaldTrump has no concept of the hard work our federal employees do every day to keep the country running. Forcing 800,000 of them to spend the holidays unsure about their next paycheck is cruel. Secretary Mattis protects this nation against the worst instincts of a President who puts our national security at risk. His announced departure should alarm every American. Court rules that the Trump administration cannot deny ‚Äúroom at the inn‚Äù to women seeking refuge from domestic violence.

&gt; His own border patrol says we need sensors/fence/etc but the wall's dumb President Trump blew the whole Iran deal up‚Äîover his own military leaders' objections, by the way‚Äîbecause of his insecurity over President Obama. An insecurity which, I might add, Saudi Arabia has played like a cheap fiddle. The Iran deal did not "give" Iran one penny; it released Iran's own money frozen in bank accounts. It imposed restrictions and inspections on Iran for decades and prohibited the country from ever purchasing, acquiring or developing any nuclear weapons. President Trump is delusional and clearly has never read the Iran deal. https://t.co/vUBNYuUzj9 The days of Congress enabling President Trump‚Äôs lies and misdirection are coming to an end.

What Republicans *should* rush: a vote on legislation to protect the Mueller investigation - given that, by week's end, the man overseeing it could be fired. There are endless reasons a survivor of sexual assault wouldn‚Äôt file a report right away, not least of which is the fear of retribution, doubt, and character attacks‚Äîa fear which Trump and many members of the GOP are instilling anew in millions of women and girls.

This appointment is for life. The stakes are so high. This nomination should be stopped. Kavanaugh failed to show respect for Supreme Court precedent. Documents from his past reveal he thinks Roe can be overturned. By stating the Court can always overrule ‚Äúsettled law,‚Äù we‚Äôre left to wonder what all he'd ‚Äúunsettle‚Äù - from the ACA to marriage equality to so much more. Kavanaugh failed to show he'll be an independent check against unlawful action by a President. He would not say whether a President must comply with subpoenas. He would not say whether a President could pardon himself. He would not decry scorched-earth attacks on law enforcement. After meeting with him, reviewing his record, and watching his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh has clearly failed to show he would be an independent check against executive power. He would threaten Supreme Court precedent on women's health, marriage equality, and more.

I will vote no. No, not knowing who the good guys are and who the bad guys are at a neo-Nazi rally is the "biggest ____ing mistake." https://t.co/MXDMrqm5T5 My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are right: Senators have been denied thousands upon thousand of documents to help understand more about Brett Kavanaugh's record and beliefs. Jamming this hearing through with so much unanswered is wrong. RT @MarkHerringVA: I had a great start to Labor Day by speaking to the Kingsmill Democrats on the importance of re-electing @timkaine.

Unions are essential to protecting workers‚Äô rights‚Äîand when workers are strong, the economy is strong. Now more than ever, we need to focus on raising wages and ensuring opportunity for ALL. How many millions did the deficit-busting Trump tax cut put into his own pockets? But it‚Äôs federal employees who are hurting our fiscal situation? ü§î https://t.co/oyO34chF4Z I wrote to the International Trade Commission to oppose these tariffs, which would‚Äôve placed yet another burden on local newspapers.

‚ÄúWhat John McCain Taught Me About Governing, Losing and Life‚Äù

https://t.co/4Ck8uvDDhb https://t.co/b7BLzF6M3r I already miss my friend John McCain. A maverick. A model of strength in Vietnam. A champion of servicemembers, campaign finance reform and many other causes. His voice loomed large, was almost always desperately needed, and will be sorely absent in the times to come. Rest easy. One of Virginia‚Äôs longtime reporters, @DaveRess1, tragically suffered a heart attack Sunday. He‚Äôs fighting now‚Äîand the Dave I know will keep digging til he gets a full recovery. His @Daily_Press colleagues have set up a page for support. Give if you can!

https://t.co/TxDY0lFEKz They just don't make 'em like John McCain anymore. For 60 years, he has served our country. As a man in uniform. As a maverick leader always seeking common ground. As a committee chairman dedicating his work to serving our troops and veterans. We love you, John. We're with you. A new @USChamber report says Virginia will see ‚Äúextremely significant damage‚Äù from Trump‚Äôs trade war, to the tune of $993 million.

Included is more than $100 million of coal exports.

What‚Äôs that about a ‚Äúwar on coal,‚Äù Mr. President?

https://t.co/38apwoCZzK https://t.co/DlCG7UxVoP We in Congress wrote a law to fund improvements to academics, schools, and digital literacy. That‚Äôs what this money should go toward.
