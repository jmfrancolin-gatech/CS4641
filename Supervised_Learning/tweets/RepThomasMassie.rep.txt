@ChuziChips You and I probably agree.  I don‚Äôt think we should tariff solar panels.  But you said ‚Äúimagine‚Äù and I thought, ‚Äúwhy imagine when we can calculate?‚Äù Turns out the tariffs on panels aren‚Äôt that significant, and frankly I‚Äôd prefer a flat tariff (on all things) to an income tax. RT @2lanterns: @RepThomasMassie Thomas, I'm pretty sure you house is compliant so you will get to quarter troops during the Reconstruction. @sharon_ringel I propose everyone evaluate their own needs and their own abilities and then act locally based on their appraisal of what needs to be done and what they can afford. That picture is of my solar panels. My original question is still valid, why are the GND sponsors green themselves? RT @TERRYC70: @RepThomasMassie if you can't afford solar panels, under the new green deal, the government will heavily fine you till you ca‚Ä¶ @TowardATheory Why don‚Äôt all the GND sponsors have solar panels on their homes?  Why not even half of them?  Why don‚Äôt at least a dozen of them have net zero homes? Maybe you believe but they don‚Äôt. @ChuziChips We don‚Äôt have to imagine.  The solar tariffs add about 10 cents to the $2.50/ watt installed price of a setup with Chinese panels. (Not much). And all the panels in this picture were produced domestically (made in USA). @Michele7216 @canderson93 The picture in the OP is my setup, making power today, yet I would never put my name to the ridiculous GND. @eastriverrunner Mine does, but it‚Äôs not cheap and sometimes we have to live without air conditioning in the summer and bundle up inside in the winter.  I just don‚Äôt think these legislators have much of a clue about what they‚Äôre asking for, because they don‚Äôt even live it themselves. @scottspjut Nice, I‚Äôm waiting to hear why those who make $174,000 per year, and have signed their names to the #GND, would be using coal and natural gas to power their homes when solar and wind solutions have been commercially available for a decade. @TerraMarQue @FreedomWorks I would have YOU do what YOU think YOU should do and what YOU can afford to do, not what a bunch of hypocrites would force you to do.  Btw, those are my solar panels in the picture.  Took that picture today. @j_desarno Great idea!  In fact, my car does run on coal when I‚Äôm not charging at home. #sassywithmassie https://t.co/S0YAusupvi @an7361 @RightGlockMom Just going without air conditioning during cloudy weeks would be enough to make them check into a hotel. üòÇ Definitely there are major compromises for the whole family when going off the grid, even with a large system like we have (and some do it with a system 1/10th the size). @cumberickman If I had a natural gas resource in my backyard, I‚Äôd frack that. The reality is everyone with a roof or yard has solar resource, yet only a few use it.  Have to ask why that is. @CindiCooper1 I haven‚Äôt looked at the wind resource maps recently but I‚Äôd wager that solar is cheaper than wind in almost all of Eastern Ky.  Natural gas and coal have them both beat until a practical battery or other type of energy storage is available. About this #GreenNewDeal, if I like the solar panels I have, can I keep them? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How much more will they cost when the #GND makes them free? üòÇ https://t.co/Sx5hsTBO6A @RightGlockMom We have ~20 chickens üêì and 7 ducks ü¶Ü .

Solar &amp; wind aren‚Äôt cheap, but every congressman makes $174,000/year.

Millions of buffalo did too... before man killed them. Story reminds me the earth releases a lot of natural gas into the atmosphere.

@benshapiro https://t.co/jkoUOo5NV2 Nick‚Äôs public statement. https://t.co/kOQiUfbry7 (5/5) In the context of everything that was going on (which the media hasn‚Äôt shown) the parents and mentors of these boys should be proud, not ashamed, of their kids‚Äô behavior. It is my honor to represent them. (4/5) In the face of racist and homosexual slurs, the young boys refused to reciprocate or disrespect anyone. Even when taunted by homophobic bigots, which was obviously bewildering to them, they insulted no one. (3/5) I‚Äôve now watched over an hour of other videos from 4 different cameras of the incident in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I urge everyone to watch the other videos before passing judgement. Would you have remained that composed at that age under those circumstances? (2/5) The honorable and tolerant students of Covington Catholic School came to DC to advocate for the unborn and to learn about our nation‚Äôs Capitol. What they got was a brutal lesson in the unjust court of public opinion and social media mobs. (1/5) I was uncomfortable when I saw the video &amp; description that first went viral, so I understand the initial reactions to the CovCath video. I chose to wait for more facts before responding because the narrative did not match what I know to be the character of these students.

If you meant to say that no one should have to come to work if they are not paid I would agree. @KYCOLGREGL They shouldn‚Äôt be working if they‚Äôre not paid.  And if that were the case (ATC, TSA, etc not working), the Dems would negotiate with Trump and this shutdown would be over in 24 hours. @kurtes25 S.24 @WilliamKColeman Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger, but what you‚Äôre asking for is a repeal of the 27th amendment to the Constitution. @ChelleTweets I agree. No one should have to work without pay, which is why they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to come to work unless there‚Äôs a congressional appropriation for their pay. If our country is doomed to bankruptcy, it‚Äôs because 2/3s of government spending is deemed MANDATORY, which means it happens whether Congress votes for it or not. Yesterday, 411 members of Congress permanently moved the entire federal payroll from discretionary to mandatory. SAD! @JeremyRFLA @SolusIgnis I agree.  If shutdowns were true shutdowns (TSA and Air traffic controllers didn‚Äôt come to work), they‚Äôd be resolved within an hour, or likely never happen. There‚Äôs a healthy discussion on the House floor about how government can force people to come to work without paying them!? @JeremyRFLA @SolusIgnis Shutdowns will still occur &amp; paychecks will be delayed &amp; many services will cease. The obligation to eventually pay everyone at the end of the shutdown regardless of whether they worked will however be on autopilot forever. So I forecast more prevalent, longer, milder?, shutdowns RT @chiproytx: This is exactly right. https://t.co/g081jO8gYE @courierjournal Misleading title written by editors who don‚Äôt care about the truth or can‚Äôt understand legislation. @SolusIgnis That‚Äôs a thoughtful question. There‚Äôs no promise of employment beyond the period of time for which Congress has appropriated money (a fiscal year). It could be changed, but it seems unwise to allow one Congress to bind the next Congress with employment contracts. When you pass a law to pay ALL FUTURE government salaries regardless of whether the government is funded or not, then you‚Äôve effectively moved the entire government payroll from discretionary to non-discretionary spending. Today‚Äôs bill was fundamentally flawed and dangerous. @Ksdsc6 If we had won this vote, there would have immediately been another vote on a more responsible bill that guarantees back pay for federal workers in the current shutdown. He‚Äôs right.  This bill makes it MORE likely that we will have MORE shutdowns.  That‚Äôs why I voted No. https://t.co/BQhgAZD4Jm @mbstra That was my first thought too, hence the heavy redactions.  lol I‚Äôm all for transparency here in Washington, but this parent just asked for too much! https://t.co/boNkUyliqC Happy birthday, Senator! #standwithrand https://t.co/lDhmCqyHUc #sassywithmassie

https://t.co/B2kwoAJCEp Thank you @TwitchyTeam for covering this thread! https://t.co/DNB99RXCRj @freedomfirstAK @4est_libertate I do think having a capacitor to keep the battery from dithering between charge and discharge could help prolong the battery life.

We have the free market for cell phones, power tools, and laptops to thank for development of these batteries. @4est_libertate I rewired the battery modules in an 8s2p configuration so the nominal voltage is about 47v instead of 375v.  You can touch it anywhere and live... just don‚Äôt have a bare metal wrench in your hands and touch the wrong places. @MatedCzech unistrut FTW! https://t.co/kQbx3ZzuUy @Spiritof1861 Thanks! 85kWhr. Would have loved to keep it in its original automotive configuration at 400 volts, but needed to wire these 8s2p to make the 48 volts that my inverters want to see. @mlthigpen Got me beat by a bit!

I can trip the whole shebang with the raspberry Pi if anything gets askew inside the battery modules. @Neubian @jsquidstew @RebuildsRich Not sure how valuable it was to this project, but I have watched hours of his videos!  Love his spirit. @rich_purtell The Water Furnace brand heat pumps have a ‚Äúsoft-start‚Äù feature that I had retrofitted to mine.  Not really necessary with this battery and 14.4kW of inverters, but helpful for the rare occasions when running directly from the backup generator while generator is charging batteries @geezheeztall @dmartosko Kinda.  Except I built the storage equivalent of 6 powerwalls, at less than half the price, using a car that was totaled, and added a feature that‚Äôs fundamentally lacking from the factory powerwall... the ability to work without a connection to the grid. @MFS314 https://t.co/p2X7EVjTx3 @MatthewAdamByrd I think it‚Äôs very neat and it could work at night when my panels don‚Äôt, but after doing the equations, it‚Äôs just not worth it here in Kentucky compared to adding more panels &amp; batteries or energy saving appliances. @LibertyGorilla 4 Outback VFX3648 inverters wired series-parallel and 6 Outback MPPTs (5x60 amp and 1x80 amp).  Legacy stuff, 12 yrs old. @RightGlockMom @dougstafford It‚Äôs a Raspberry Pi talking to an Arduino (using ASCII over serial) talking to tesla BMS boards (using CAN protocol). If you look real close, toward the back, there‚Äôs an automotive cigarette lighter plug thrown in there to convert the Arduino 12v source to 5v for the pi.  üò≠ @SumySchick @TheSwampSeries There‚Äôs at least one original episode still available on twitter @TheSwampSeries.  They pulled it from FB to retool and add more material (they are actively filming). @Ketantucky @jeffblev @ZackJohnson777 Could you call my office and leave your name and phone # and explain we met on Twitter?  I‚Äôll call you back and we can chat if you‚Äôd like. @4est_libertate I‚Äôve been off the grid for 12 years, so I don‚Äôt have the wires or the meter to sell it back. @4est_libertate 85kWhr storage, 14 kW panels ~&gt; 56kWhr/day avg yearly production in KY, 18kWhr/day base consumption (w/o heat pump). 2 heat pumps that can each consume 2kW @ 100% duty cycle. But it‚Äôs all about the peaks and valleys, and we burn wood in the winter in a 40kW gasifying boiler. @DeanFromNJ Some days I feel guilty about all the carbon I consume, repurpose,  and sequester on my farm. Thank goodness Al Gore is replenishing it!
#sassywithmassie @jeffblev @ZackJohnson777 C has all the power and ease of use of assembly.  üò≠ @ElectricInfidel @krweid Where did I deny evolution?  I‚Äôm probably the only person in Congress who has actually read ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Species.‚Äù I‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt. Also, climate change is real. Glaciers once covered much of what is now the United States and CO2 %age has been 5 times greater. @BrendanJAQuinn @TheCartelMatt Fortunately, mine is not wrecked.  This one came from Georgia. @jsquidstew Haha, no. Someone else did. I drive to Georgia with a trailer to get it.  I have one that‚Äôs not wrecked too. @MrDrewHashtag Four part series... here‚Äôs the first (kinda long, sorry - I edited it using iMovie on my iPhone SE, lol)

But this is a dumpster fire and politicians regularly provide the fuel so I think all the words are OK now? @tman1112000 Never.  We conserve before we run out, and when all else fails, a propane generator kicks on, but rarely. @ZackJohnson777 C and C++ typically use the same compiler (C is a subset of C++).  I‚Äôd tinker with an interpreted language without all the syntax and memory declaration issues (BASIC or python), and then go on to C (if you want to do real-time controls type stuff).  But I am old fashioned. @jsquidstew @jolmstead2k I invented a haptic (touch interface) for virtual reality that my wife and I used to start a company in our married student housing dorm at MIT.  (she graduated from MIT too) @MrDrewHashtag Lol. good point! It was originally the OUTSIDE wall of my basement, so it was poured and coated in tar to waterproof it.  Then I built a masonry room next to the basement (for the batteries) and just painted over the tar.  The batteries and I don‚Äôt care what that wall looks like. Everything in our house, including geothermal heat-pump and deep freezer (full of grass-fed beef ü•© we raised), is running on this rekt ModelS tesla battery right now. It was charged by solar today. I built it &amp; programmed it in C on a Pi.

TFW haters call me anti-science... üëåü§ì https://t.co/x90e6wQya4 @RoKhanna Thank you for leading on this issue! @JMLesq The good news/bad news on this front is that most of the decisions are made by state governments.  That‚Äôs good news for the most part, since it‚Äôs easier to influence the regulatory commissions and laws of the state in which you live, and the best answer must be tailored to region @ArnMenconi I‚Äôll give @RoKhanna first dibs, and gladly cosponsor again. The new House rules are more predisposed to letting us exercise our Article I Section 8 authority wrt matters of war. @ScapeKangaroo @wonderclutz Of my 435 colleagues, I‚Äôm pretty sure that even with massive coaching, 430 of them couldn‚Äôt solve a diffy-Q to save their lives.  Yet they‚Äôre all experts on climate change. @wonderclutz If you think solar is expensive now, just wait ‚Äòtil the government makes it free! #GreenNewDeal With respect to climate policy: what is it that you‚Äôre not doing now that you‚Äôd like the government to force you to do?  Or would this policy you want just be for people other than you? https://t.co/55RHZoj1mX Trans-partisan &gt;&gt; Bi-partisan @Daboyz1995 They occasionally get a few wrong.  What else can I say?  üòÇ
