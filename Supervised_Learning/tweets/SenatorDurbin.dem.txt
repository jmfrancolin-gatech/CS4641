Spoke to Acting EPA Administrator Wheeler this morning on the reports of high emissions of ethylene oxide at Sterigenics, and misconduct at the facility. I made it clear to him that EPA has no time to waste in getting to the bottom of this, and that Illinoisans deserve answers. Good news for Chicago as @Ford will make a big investment in our workers and state. https://t.co/FCgcD5lxBU In 1983, Harold Washington became the first African American Mayor of Chicago.

With fast-growing student loan debt, less access to affordable housing, and a lack of competition in the credit/debit card markets, we agreed action is necessary to help Americans get ahead. The payday lending rule was established to prevent predatory lenders from charging cash-strapped consumers ridiculous interest rates &amp; hidden fees. By gutting key protections of the rule, Director Kraninger has sided with special interests at the expense of hardworking families. https://t.co/594FSJtORA I am confident Congress can reach an agreement on border security if we ignore the President’s threats of another government shutdown or national emergency declaration and focus on smart &amp; effective border security.

My bill will target these companies by shortening FDA monopoly periods to bring lower-cost generics to the drug market sooner. https://t.co/1K0uMxCkcZ For too long, Big Pharma has been protected from competition by govt-granted monopolies—enabling them to price-gouge patients with ever-higher costs for drugs, like insulin. I also made clear that Congress will remember those within the outgoing regime who played a constructive role in a peaceful transition when considering future targeted American sanctions. Welcomed top Venezuelan diplomat to U.S., @carlosvecchio, to discuss ongoing Venezuelan government transition under Juan Guaidó.

The @Cubs have a challenge and an opportunity to turn this embarrassing moment into a clear commitment to the diversity of their fan base and the nation we call home. When this President says his Administration is unlike anything in the history of this country, there is no argument that he’s right. #SOTU And America’s confidence in our government is at risk because we’ve been shaken by this President and his Cabinet riddled with corruption and conflicts of interest.  #SOTU Our economy is at risk because President Trump’s tax scam left the middle class behind. #SOTU Our planet is at risk because this President and his party have broken with every nation on Earth in their opposition to responsibly address #climatechange. #SOTU Our national security is at risk because of threats to #NATO, a return to an arms race, and a phony caravan crisis at our southern border all brought on by this President. #SOTU The basic services of our government are at risk because of President Trump’s 35-day shutdown and threat to do it again next week. #SOTU What is the state of the union under President Trump? Affordable health insurance — including for people with pre-existing conditions — is at risk because of a lawsuit filed by Republican Attorneys General and supported by this President and his Administration. #SOTU Pictured: @SenDuckworth, @RepChuyGarcia, @RepUnderwood, @RepCasten, @RepSchneider, @RepBillFoster, @RepRobinKelly, @RepCheri, @RepSchakowsky, @CongressmanRaja Great to see so many members from the Illinois Congressional Delegation and their #SOTU guests tonight in my office before the speech. https://t.co/GGnOyz3b9G Toby Hauck, Aurora air traffic controller and @usairforce veteran, has arrived for the #SOTU.

Its success has been important for job creation and revenue in Chicago. https://t.co/frOIliBLYb Myself, @SenDuckworth, and members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation will continue to monitor the progress and decisions made by the EPA and hold them accountable for oversight of Sterigenics. As I’ve said for months, the EPA can no longer sit on its hands. It must take strong steps to protect the health of Illinois residents exposed to this carcinogen. Immediately. EPA’s newest data just confirmed that Sterigenics is indeed responsible for dangerously high emissions of ethylene oxide at its Willowbrook monitoring sites.

Ms. Rao also has very limited experience practicing law. She has never tried a case or argued an appeal, and she reported that she has only worked on three litigation matters in her entire career. Ms. Rao wrote that “Myths of sexual and racial oppression propagate themselves, create hysteria, and finally lead to the formation of some whining new group.” She has a troubling history of expressing cringeworthy views on race, gender, sexual assault, and LGBTQ issues. Neomi Rao, President Trump’s nominee to serve on the D.C. Circuit, gave testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee today. I asked her to explain her past writings where she discussed “myths of racial and gender oppression.” https://t.co/L5OUoEfqUw Excited to welcome Aurora air traffic controller and @usairforce veteran Toby Hauck as my guest to tonight’s #SOTU https://t.co/p8OdfjkYAr Thanks again to @GUpolitics for hosting me tonight.

I’m proud to support the establishment of a Springfield Race Riot National Monument, which would honor the lives lost by these hate-filled crimes and allow future generations to learn from this event. The 1908 Springfield Race Riots are a part of Illinois’ history that will never be forgotten. In the aftermath of this violent, hate-fueled tragedy that resulted in the murder of six African Americans, the @NAACP was born. On 1st day of #BlackHistoryMonth, @SenDuckworth &amp; I are announcing a bill that would designate the 1908 Race Riot Sites in Springfield as a National Monument. It would help future generations learn from our past &amp; renew our commitment to fighting prejudice &amp; promoting equality.

How can Pharma continue to raise prices on this life-saving medication for patients with diabetes? https://t.co/EikaFIma5k Pfizer has increased the price of its drug for nerve pain, Lyrica, 433% in 13 years. Because Lyrica’s govt-granted monopoly has protected it from lower-cost competitor drugs, Pfizer has been able to increase the price with impunity. https://t.co/tu5vND74jn Health care is still too expensive for too many working families, and the soaring cost of prescription drugs is one of the major reasons why.

Our political system is riddled with special interest spending, voter suppression tactics, and ethical loopholes that we need to address. https://t.co/ipLMLgGFts Introducing a bill with @RepSchneider to reduce gun violence from stolen firearms. Gun dealer thefts are increasing, and many of these guns are then used in crimes. Congress must summon the courage to pass commonsense reforms, and this bill should be part of that conversation.

Mr. President, end this shutdown. https://t.co/oJdXw7qCfs There are several Continuing Resolution options available to reopen the government. I hope my Republican colleagues will join our call to open the government as soon as possible. Unfortunately, not enough of my Republican colleagues joined this bipartisan effort, so the government will remain closed for now and federal employees will risk missing yet another paycheck. There is no reason why essential federal employees should continue to suffer while politicians in Washington bargain a compromise on border security. That is why I voted to reopen the government for two weeks while we continue to debate smart and effective border security. This isn’t a compromise. I have always backed smart measures to secure our border, but this is an anti-immigrant wish-list that I can’t support. Makes it much harder for anyone fleeing persecution to claim asylum. Makes it much more difficult to receive TPS in the future, and guts protections for Central American children seeking safe haven in our country. Excludes hundreds of thousands of DACA-eligible individuals and all TPS recipients from the African countries the President disparaged.

Today I heard from federal correctional officers in Marion, IL who are worried about how they will afford child care, gas for their vehicles, and other necessities while working without pay during the shutdown. https://t.co/bHNtY0qCzn My thanks to the @OrlandParkpd for their quick response to yesterday's mall shooting in Orland Park. My heart goes out to the victims and those affected by this senseless tragedy. As the police search for the gunman, the community should heed guidance from local law enforcement. Honored to participate in Decatur’s Human Relations Commission’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Day service at the Church of the Living God yesterday. https://t.co/XFndr1AdpZ The message of Martin Luther King Jr. continues to be a voice of inspiration around the world, and it pushes our nation forward to be its best self. On this #MLKDay, we honor the legacy and life work of one of our country’s greatest leaders. https://t.co/vpk5FFGukf Mr. President, let's make this dream come true. I have a dream. On MLK Day, President Trump announces the shutdown will end this week. Senators of both parties agree to stay in session this week until we can produce 60 votes for a bill that finally protects Dreamers &amp; reaches an agreement on border security. Mr. President, your proposed "fix" leaves thousands of the victims of your DACA abolition unprotected. No honest solution will leave these forgotten young people behind. Yes, Mr. President, our immigration system is broken but your shutdown has broken our government and the lives of 800,000 federal employees and thousands of contractors including 250,000 veterans. Fix the shutdown then let's work together to fix immigration. My response to reported White House offer to end President Trump's government shutdown in exchange for the border wall and DACA: https://t.co/WhsJgRNW56 As the 4th week of the #TrumpShutdown comes to an end, our country’s legal system is now facing the tough impacts of the shutdown. Federal courts are running out of money. Is this really what the President thinks is best for our country? https://t.co/PFeKer93YQ This morning I sat down with federal workers directly affected by the government shutdown. No hardworking American deserves to have their paycheck held hostage. It’s time to end this #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/5AhPiQet6u RT @704afge: We’re here with @SenatorDurbin and members of the Illinois congressional delegation. The #GovernmentShutdown is devastating to… The President has successfully forced the longest government shutdown in this country’s history. That’s 28 days of more than 800,000 federal employees working without pay. This is unacceptable. Reopen the government and allow for negotiations on border security to continue. Illinois: keep an eye on @ReadyIllinois for weather updates this weekend as more winter weather heads our way. Good to meet with Mexico's new Ambassador to the U.S. @Martha_Barcena along with @RepChuyGarcia this week to discuss U.S.-Mexico relations. https://t.co/RiVlvBgubB The President has a wall around his mind when it comes to border security. Here’s how we can effectively secure our border and stop drugs from flowing in: https://t.co/RxjUd8JYXn Too many innocent Americans are being punished for an unrealistic campaign promise of a border wall. Tune into @NPR's All Things Considered tonight around 6pm ET / 5pm CT to hear my thoughts on the President's senseless government shutdown. HAPPENING NOW: Instead of voting on a bill to reopen the government and pay our federal employees, Senator McConnell is making the Senate vote on an anti-choice bill that would restrict women’s rights. I will vote no. America can have border security without bullying and we can be safe without treating toddlers as terrorists. DHS Secretary Nielsen should accept responsibility for this outrage and resign. No one has been held accountable for this humanitarian disaster at our Southern border. Instead President Trump continues to push anti-immigrant policies making it easier to detain and deport children as a condition for reopening the government. It’s inconceivable that our government chose to secretly separate thousands of children from their parents, was unable or unwilling to reunite these families for months due to incompetent leadership and poor planning, and still doesn’t know how many children were separated. The Trump Administration’s family separation policy is more than a bureaucratic lapse in judgment. It is and was a cruel policy inconsistent with the values of this nation. https://t.co/32rd6g0QxU Today’s bombshell report reveals the true scope of this horrific policy: thousands of children were forcibly removed from their parents before the policy was made public and the fate of these children is still unknown. https://t.co/WMBzyVczfM Joining @CNNnewsroom at 10am ET / 9am CT to discuss this week's Attorney General nomination hearing, and the ongoing #TrumpShutdown. Tune in. It’s time for President Trump to wake up and recognize that his shutdown is hurting people from all walks of life, including hardworking veterans like Toby. They don’t deserve to be punished for a campaign promise. Here’s what Toby had to say about the #TrumpShutdown: “It's not acceptable as a veteran, as a federal employee, as an air traffic controller to use my profession and my livelihood as a political football.” I agree. Veterans are some of the hardest hit by the Trump shutdown. Today, as many as 250,000 veterans across the country – direct hire federal workers and contractors alike – are going without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown. Toby, a 6-year Air Force veteran from Aurora, is an air traffic controller who has gone without a paycheck since Dec. 31. I shared his story today on the Senate floor. https://t.co/avsTd92kRF Yesterday, I sat down with CBP Commissioner McAleenan. Customs officers at legal ports of entry seize the vast majority of lethal narcotics coming into our country. We need more screening technology, not a wall, to stop the flow of drugs through our border. https://t.co/59BdJzLPdR As the #TrumpShutdown continues, its impact on climate science is taking a toll. Researchers can’t finish reports on critical data that helps the world understand the effects of climate change each year. https://t.co/Ii16sEDmQQ Stood with @SenateDems today to tell President Trump enough is enough – end this hurtful and unnecessary shutdown. https://t.co/vvUNulNKKe My message to Senator McConnell: reopen the government while we continue to negotiate border security. You do not need a permission slip from President Trump to do your job. It’s time for the Senate to act. All of this pain that President Trump is causing is over a campaign promise. We can have a debate about effective border security, but we shouldn’t do it while holding the rest of the federal government hostage. President Trump continues to hold the hard-earned paychecks of Americans around the country hostage in a desperate attempt to fulfill an unrealistic campaign promise that the majority of Americans oppose. Americans deserve the right to affordable and quality health care. Congress must act now to defend the #ACA and protect American’s health care. I will continue to call on Republican leadership to bring this resolution up for a vote on the Senate floor. Once again, the #ACA is under attack by the Republican party. The TX court ruling completely undermines protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. I’ve cosponsored the Senate Resolution that will help defend the ACA and protect people with pre-existing conditions https://t.co/aXWslhDj9W I asked President Trump’s AG nominee William Barr whether he believes barriers will stop the flow of drugs from coming through our border at legal ports of entry. Experts say more screening technology, not a wall, is what works. https://t.co/JINyvKkaBJ
