Last week I was appointed to chair the Select Committee on Modernization. I can't wait to get to work.

https://t.co/N4iFacjARn The #shutdown over the wall directly affects our friends, neighbors, and our economy. It is wrong, and it's time to re-open the government. https://t.co/KLyrDiA07a 800,000 federal workers are trying to figure out how to make rent, pay a mortgage and put gas in their cars without a paycheck because of the  #shutdown.

Protecting voting rights, strengthening ethics rules to ensure that public officials serve the public interest, and reducing the role of big money in politics are vital first steps. #HR1 does all these things. üá∫üá∏üó≥Ô∏èüî¶ Americans deserve to know who is paying for the political ads they see online, and we deserve to know that the nation‚Äôs election watchdog is walking the beat and protecting our democracy. I‚Äôm excited that the first bill the House has taken up this year, #HR1, includes two bipartisan proposals for which I‚Äôve advocated- the #HonestAds Act and a bill that reforms the Federal Election Commission, the nation's election watchdog. Americans deserve a Congress that approaches its work in innovative new ways. I‚Äôm honored to have been chosen to lead the committee tasked with coming up with the ways to modernize Congress and get it working for the people again. 

I can't wait to start.

https://t.co/lYgfLhs9sw This committee represents an important step forward in renovating the House.  Americans deserve a Congress where they have a say and things get done.  They deserve a Congress that uses cutting-edge technology and that is as diverse as our nation. 2/3 It has been clear for a long time that the House is a fixer-upper. Every time bills are written behind closed doors or passed without debate, every time Americans feel like they don‚Äôt have a say and too little is getting done, people lose faith. Congress needs to do better. 1/3 Great to cross paths today with my former House colleague @SenDuckworth!

First order of business is swearing in new members and then later today, passing a bill that could get the government re-opened. 

Stay tuned through the day for updates! https://t.co/bZjra5nb4f The @seattletimes is right: Veterans deserve better. It is unacceptable that veterans aren't receiving the GI Bill benefits they've earned. The VA must pay #veterans what they're owed, &amp; the government must fix the breakdowns that led to this problem. https://t.co/jHntf5Rc4p Happy New Year!! https://t.co/paxcdi5RZp Federal workers in our region maintain Navy ships, care for veterans, deliver the mail, welcome visitors at the national park, prep timber sales and do other critical jobs. Cancelling cost of living increases is wrong for them - and for our local economy.  https://t.co/NmUEh7BxLm Federal workers aren‚Äôt Democrats or Republicans when they‚Äôre at work.

The team effort between the city, state, our senators &amp; SoundTransit helped fund the project which will yield 6 new stops, connect more people to each other, help folks get to work and bring more people downtown. üöâ https://t.co/f8ZhIkR8hq Washingtonians have always had a strong connection to the water. Today, I'm proud to help start the next chapter of our legacy by officially opening the fast ferry between Kingston &amp; Seattle. It will cut time people spend commuting &amp; connect more people to more opportunities! ‚õ¥Ô∏è https://t.co/b1v8AhzWkD I enjoyed attending the Washington Youth Academy 10-Year Reunion.¬†¬†I was honored to extend gratitude to Larry Pierce, the Academy‚Äôs director who is retiring at the end of the year.¬†¬†He has an amazing legacy and has changed a lot of lives for the better.¬†¬†Thank you Larry! https://t.co/0gbOqrzzDw RT @komonewsradio: It's official üê∂

@UW's President hosted the "Passing of the Collar" ceremony from Dubs (@UWMascot) to Dubs II (@DubsUW)‚Ä¶ When I was a freshman in college, I shared a room with 6 other guys.  We owned 3 movies ‚Äî one of them was The Princess Bride, which we probably  watched 100 times.  Thank you  William Goldman. I‚Äôll wear my Andre the Giant T-shirt tomorrow. #inconceivable https://t.co/zGB9Hzossw The fight to save the orca is also a fight to protect our economy and identity. While the state considers these options, Congress should step up and pass the P3 Act and other policies which lead to cleaner water, more salmon and orca, &amp; a healthier Sound. 
https://t.co/otOVCo1lw1 It is Dutch-American Heritage Day! On Nov 16, 1776 the colonies signed a friendship treaty with the Netherlands, who supported our independence. As the son and grandson of Dutch immigrants, and as co-chair of the Congressional #Dutch Caucus, I'm proud to celebrate our bond! üá∫üá∏üá≥üá± @seungminkim One of my favorites too (until they let me form the Star Wars Caucus) Unacceptable. #Veterans deserve better.

https://t.co/S6rDwB5Vjg RT @PattyMurray: Proud to join @SIHB1, @lisamurkowski, @SenatorHeitkamp &amp; colleagues from both sides of the aisle to shine a light on the d‚Ä¶ We will never forget the selflessness of our nation's veterans and service members. Here is more from @PenDailyNews on yesterday's ceremony honoring @USNavy SeaBee Marvin Shields, who gave his life for our country in Vietnam.

Thank you.

https://t.co/tQG064doc6 Hate has no place in America. 

In Sept., a bill I wrote making threats against religious community centers a hate crime was signed into law. 

There's more work to do. Congress should lead. It's time for civility, debate and results rather than bickering. https://t.co/FV3XjctO6Q I'm lucky to be the beneficiary of the valuable advice and assistance of two veterans who joined my team after serving our country. Here are their stories.

https://t.co/HUpkIfqNfl https://t.co/gQHa87BDVq To all who serve and have served, and to your families: thank you. 

Today I joined with community members across our region to thank and honor veterans. To all who serve and have served, and to your families: thank you.

#VeteransDay18 https://t.co/QxVtBgV1FJ As we mark 100 years since the end of World War I, I also take a moment to especially remember the 4.7 million Americans who served in that conflict. #WWI100 Today, we honor our #veterans and servicemembers. To all Americans who answered the call to defend our freedom, protect our democracy, and serve our country - I thank you for your sacrifice. #VeteransDay2018 I am saddened to once again wake up to the news of another senseless mass shooting. I mourn with the families affected by the #BorderLineShooting. Congress must step up--there have been far too many moments of silence, and virtually no moments of action. #EnoughIsEnough Wishing my friends celebrating #Diwali a prosperous new year and a joyous Festival of Lights. üéá Serving Washington's 6th District for the last few years has been an honor--thank you. I'm going to use the next two years to keep pushing for an economy that works for everyone and to get #Congress back on track so it works as hard as all of you. https://t.co/3GtwZUkatm Happy National Donut Day!¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm celebrating with a Seahawk-colored donut with tiny chocolate footballs. üç©¬†¬†#dietstartswednesday #NationalDonutDay https://t.co/28W3642GO8 Today, I met with Mayor Greg Wheeler in Bremerton. We talked about how federal investments in infrastructure can help attract new businesses and jobs. We also talked about how Congress should work together &amp; better support small businesses and major employers like the shipyard. https://t.co/7HmsZagIIU Good morning PSNS. Thanks for the important work you do every day.

If you live in the 6th Congressional District, you're the boss, and I work for you. If you're having an issue with a federal agency, my team and I may be able to help. https://t.co/ktAX5S6xNt https://t.co/x1tuiuMAEB An inspiring presentation by Jonathan Webb of Orphans at War and Ryan Blanck of the Hanger Clinic (@HangerNews) about the work they‚Äôre doing to support orphans in Iraq.¬†¬†Grateful for what they‚Äôre doing to change lives. https://t.co/kJIgGgV0hN These cuts are outrageous. I‚Äôm going to pursue all of the options available to prevent these cuts from happening. 

https://t.co/slgwn7ZPlo It was heartening to see so many people of all faiths join Congregation Kol Shalom on Bainbridge today.  Thank you, Rabbi Strasko, for your inspiring words. Thanks to the Federal Managers Assoc for meeting with me today. Folks in our neck of the woods shouldn't have to worry about furloughs because Congress can‚Äôt do its job. That's why I'm working w/ @rep_stevewomack and the bipartisan budget reform committee. https://t.co/EQ5ZUB4veR https://t.co/f3TldjZOAx This morning I met w/ local students with @RESULTS_Tweets and the Bainbridge Island High School @PIH Engage Club. Thank you for being so engaged and for the thoughtful questions about global health. The future is looking bright. üòé https://t.co/KKfj4vrr2y Today as part of the national Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War I joined friends and neighbors in Port Ludlow to say something long overdue to local veterans - thank you. Thank you to all who came tonight, and to all who served. #Vietnam50th https://t.co/VzSsGWX4TH RT @PenDailyNews: Veteran pinning ceremony set in Port Ludlow - https://t.co/jXRSVlJBjd https://t.co/u9FTCbtnUE There's a reason the House is less popular than head lice and Nickelback. It's because House rules prioritize partisanship over consensus. 

@RepKenBuck &amp; I think it's time to rewrite the rules. 

https://t.co/8x5sChs4MF RT @WAplanfinder: Time to get moving! #OpenEnrollment is officially underway. Let's all #GetCoveredWA. https://t.co/o84KAsglwc Today, I had another Kilmer At Your Company visit with Bradken Atlas, a local steel manufacturer that produces parts for our military. Thanks for the important work your business does to support the people who keep us safe. https://t.co/LnjHbY6KIe Students at @olympiccollege are among the hundreds of thousands of student veterans who are experiencing financial hardships because of the VA's failure to implement a housing stipend increase. Affected by the problem? Call 888-442-4551 to file a claim. https://t.co/yjcL6P5Erq If you served our country, you shouldn't have to fight for your benefits. Today I met w/ student veterans at @uwtacoma who haven't received GI Bill benefits the VA owes them because of a a computer glitch. This is totally unacceptable. https://t.co/JOZVUsrf2f According to the @seattletimes 4 out of 5 WA residents say kids aren't learning the real-world skills they need for great jobs. The state is innovating. Congress can too by passing the Compete for the Future Act which expands access to pre-apprenticeships. https://t.co/dwd4OKsq0H When it comes to health care, Congress should follow the same rules as doctors: first do no harm. Yesterday, I spoke w/ folks at the Coordinated Care Community Leaders Breakfast about ways to improve health care &amp; the importance of protecting patients w/ pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/MFqzM8mamO A few weeks ago, the South Sound Summit invited me to speak about civility. Congress is broken. It's time for a process that prioritizes civil debate and consensus-building over partisan bickering. That's possible, &amp; it would go a long way in restoring faith in government. https://t.co/h0ZNyxwHzb Traveling around our community, I see how the @uwpc is uniting caring people around its goal to empower 15k families in our area by 2028. Thanks to Dona Ponepinto for meeting with me! Count me as a partner in the work to create more economic opportunities for more people. https://t.co/SqHqwNMIel In today's installment of Kilmer At Your Company I met with Kurt Carlson, the CEO of Propel Insurance (@PropelIns). Thanks for the update on your work which is affected by the decisions Congress makes on everything from cyber-security to health care. https://t.co/ec5WMgjq8E Great checking in today w/ the Tacoma-Pierce Co. Assoc. of Realtors. We talked about how housing policy affects everything from economic development to homelessness. Read more in the @HouseNewDems report which our neighbor @repdennyheck led here: https://t.co/NkJb6N7Gfe https://t.co/BAvoKzJC55 Thanks to all of the people ‚Äî of all faiths ‚Äî who attended tonight‚Äôs vigil at Temple Beth El in Tacoma.  We will never accept these senseless acts of violence. 

#SquirrelHill I am reminded of the words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who said:
‚ÄúDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.‚Äù #PittsburghStrong I am saddened and angered by today‚Äôs shooting in #Pittsburgh. Hatred has no place in our society. Neither does violence.  We‚Äôve seen too many moments of silence and too few moments of action to prevent tragedies like today‚Äôs. (1/2) Honored to attend the Change of Command Ceremony today at @NavalBaseKitsap.¬†¬†Welcome back to Kitsap, Captain Moretty, and all the best to Captain LaCoste and his family as he heads into retirement.¬†¬†Fair winds and following seas. https://t.co/1fNgPZnEY1 Yesterday in my latest Kilmer At Your Company visit, I stopped by Flip Fresh Market, a new grocery store in Tacoma. Congratulations on growing from a successful online business to this new chapter with a storefront. Thanks for choosing to locate in our neck of the woods! https://t.co/NtQNVfVC0P #TBT to last week's visit with the folks at Tri-Tec Manufacturing up the road in Kent in my friend @RepAdamSmith's district. I had a great time learning about how this family-owned business produces parts for our Navy's aircraft carriers as part of the @ACIBC. Good to see you! https://t.co/R3FWiDcoUb Congress needs to keep stepping up so communities can expand mental health accessibility and address the opioid crisis. It should also provide more access to medicines that reverse overdoses like Naloxone, which I've pushed for w/ @AppropsDems . More: https://t.co/wbk9Gh6wwo I spent the AM w/ the Tacoma PD (@pio1tpd) and @TacomaFire. We talked about the need for expanded mental health and addiction treatment options. Then I rode along w/ the @TacomFire's CARE team, who are on the front lines responding to mental health and addiction crises. https://t.co/YQBMjYDb41 This is so cool! It is great to see teachers in our area bringing our kids new technologies and learning opportunities that hopefully spark a lifelong curiosity in the computer sciences. #STEM
