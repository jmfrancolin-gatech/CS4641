Iran continues to develop its missile capabilities despite UNSC action. We must ensure that the Iranian regime does not gain a nuclear weapon and hold them accountable for violating international law. https://t.co/6Kjz0TV4T5 Today @RepZoeLofgren and I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 (H.R. 1044), to eliminate arbitrary per-country limits that cause backlogs in the employment-based green card system. Read HERE: https://t.co/riSXlwbfDd Everyone's voice deserves to be heard, especially one of our own @HouseGOP. https://t.co/KoGt2swy7Q .@HouseJudiciary is meeting today to discuss legislation to prevent mass violence. #HR8 claims to be a solution, but solves nothing. It’s disingenuous to advocate for new laws that won’t work while refusing to enforce current laws that would prevent violent crimes. #ICYMI: Listen to my radio interview with @KOANewsRadio this morning https://t.co/YpE7jaTcqK Over the last two years, we have made great strides. Tonight @POTUS  reaffirmed his commitment to offer common sense, bipartisan solutions to achieve American greatness. I’m eager to work with President Trump to support our promises to the American people. #SOTU Tonight, @POTUS will deliver the #SOTU. I encourage you to watch the live stream from the @WhiteHouse. I want to hear from you so feel free to share your thoughts with me below. https://t.co/Yzo9ifDBb1 Great to see a Colorado native nominated to lead the Department of the @Interior! David Bernhardt @DOIDepSec brings tremendous leadership with him from our home state of #Colorado and I look forward to a swift confirmation process. #ICYMI: Last week, I re-introduced the WATER Act to keep water affordable for our local communities across #Colorado. My friend @SenCoryGardner will be introducing the Senate companion bill as well. For more information on this legislation, read here: https://t.co/nMZO2QuWen As the situation in #Venezuela worsens, we stand ready to act. The #Maduro regime's decision to violently crack down on its citizens must not be tolerated. Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015. It is clear that change is needed: https://t.co/FEfsbI0Gp9 Under no circumstance should we allow infanticide in this country. It is wrong and it is against everything we stand for. Coming from a Pediatric Neurologist who has spent a lifetime caring for children, I find @GovernorVA #RalphNortham's comments absolutely horrendous. Watch: https://t.co/WxkmtcO1tM Glad I could join my colleagues to discuss a constitutional issue that needs to be addressed, and I hope we can pass this War Powers Resolution in the House to reclaim our legislative authority over war-making activities in Congress for the sake of our men and women in uniform. https://t.co/JMQZJUlZmo House Judiciary held its first hearing on #HR1 to “restore our democracy.” This bill does the exact opposite. Instead of protecting the integrity of our elections it encourages voter fraud &amp; undermines the American electoral system. Here are my remarks: https://t.co/B3BYbG9rJI Our elections should be fair and free from all forms of manipulations. H.R. 1 on the other hand, promotes voter fraud and uses taxpayer money to fund partisan political campaigns. @JudiciaryGOP #ICYMI: Listen to my radio interview with @KOANewsRadio this morning https://t.co/md0gyFKUzT Students have different learning styles and needs. Meeting these needs is critical to our children’s success. Join me in celebrating #SchoolChoiceWeek, because every child deserves an education that will allow them to grow and thrive. #NSCW2019 https://t.co/Lq6j48LF88 Today I was named the Ranking Member of the @JudiciaryGOP Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship. My colleagues and I have an important role to play in addressing our broken immigration system. I’m looking forward to getting to work. Americans across the country traveled to D.C. to #MarchforLife. I stand with them because I believe in the inherent value of every human life. We must do everything we can to promote policies that protect life for every human being, especially for our most vulnerable: the unborn. https://t.co/Wssvsn1WJY RT @BreitbartNews: "They don't take Ken Buck's name when they assume somebody's identity." —@RepKenBuck https://t.co/D1pxWZb6Wm Today, we salute the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect ours.

What a time to reflect on the many blessings God has given us. In the dark of night he offered his son to the world, and in doing so he offered us salvation. I hope you enjoy time with family and friends this Christmas. I commend the EPA for reworking this rule in a way that sets boundaries on the federal government’s jurisdiction. I trust that states and local property owners can steward their water resources better than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. https://t.co/LH0YvcuOEm Congratulations to Matthew Paris, winner of the #CongressionalAppChallenge for the 4th District! Matthew's app, "Home Safe," makes it easier for people to get out of problematic situations.

His record is one of selfless service to this country, and for that we all thank him. As he and Barbara are now reunited, we keep the rest of his family in our prayers. #41 Scott Eden used his #TCJA #TaxCuts to help his employees and grow his company. Good policy has good consequences. Watch his story here: https://t.co/miVpLUAA0g Putting more money into the pockets of small business owners allows them to pay higher wages and grow their business. That's one reason why we passed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. https://t.co/miVpLUSboQ I'm focused on making sure that the price of aluminum in America is set in a fair and consistent manner, for all the industries and consumers in Colorado who rely on aluminum in products. https://t.co/0De1JlLFib I'm thankful the law enforcement officers involved in this incident are all safe and I'm grateful for their vigilance. https://t.co/cIc0oxZ6ID Congratulations to all the men and women at Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado who played a part in building NASA's #InSight Lander, which touched down on Mars this afternoon! https://t.co/71votsDJ6G Happy #Thanksgiving! I hope everyone has a chance today to reflect on the ways they're thankful. I'm grateful today for a loving family, for a caring community, and for a country that believes in freedom. On #WorldDiabetesDay, we have a chance to recognize the 29 million Americans and their families who struggle with this difficult disease. Thank you to those men and women who have served, and thank you to the families and friends who have supported those who have served. #veteransday Today, we mark the many American lives lost in #WorldWarI. Though distant from our present day, their fight greatly influenced the world we know today, ushering in a world order that prioritizes American values like peace, democracy, and free markets. Thank you to all who have, all who are, and all who will call themselves a United States Marine. #MarineCorpsBirthday https://t.co/JhSQeEG4oS RT @NatResources: More than a third of America’s national parks are battlefields, cemeteries, and other sites that honor our military veter… Great jobs numbers this morning! https://t.co/PY0uYz0oty If we want Congress to work better for the people, then we need to change the way we do business around here. Read this op-ed I co-authored with @repderekkilmer to learn about our ideas for reform: https://t.co/qXjdw0RGOm My heart is with those impacted by the senseless violence against citizens who were simply practicing their freedom to worship. We need to stand together against violence—sending a strong message that attacks on officials, worshipers, or any Americans are unacceptable. Today is the DEA’s prescription drug take back day. Learn more at this link and participate in our nation’s effort to combat the opioid crisis: https://t.co/Kt95moM5ZB Guatemala is a strategic partner for the U.S. I thank President Morales for visiting the United States and I hope we can develop a closer friendship between our nations during his visit. https://t.co/0xfQRwFRHH Great economic news this morning. Our economy is thriving, but that doesn't mean we should stop fighting for free-market policies that promote job creation and economic growth. https://t.co/jYt2rsbjUo My District Director, Robin Coran, had a great day getting coffee with law enforcement officers in Douglas County. Thanks so much to those who choose this line of work. We know it's challenging sometimes, and we really shouldn't take for granted the cost you pay to keep us safe. https://t.co/KT6CFx8S0i Important data on wage growth. Rolling back excessive regulation and lowering taxes frees more dollars for employers to pay their employees. https://t.co/hR1YV0OJok Today, I voted for Tax Reform 2.0. This legislation makes permanent most of the tax cuts that impact individuals and families. https://t.co/FTSAxf33Gw RT @SpeakerRyan: More than 100 lives are lost each day to the #OpioidCrisis.

My provisions keep wholesalers and law enforcement on the same page with each other.
https://t.co/RVAAuWjP5y I'm thankful my language to enhance data-sharing between wholesalers and law enforcement made it into the final, bicameral, bipartisan opioid agreement legislation. https://t.co/70n4jDGglX We need to reassert Congress' Constitutional duty to declare and oversee war-making in this country. Watch C-SPAN tonight around 7 MT when I'll be leading an hour of bipartisan floor time on this topic. Also, check out my op-ed on the issue: https://t.co/grdDjkX0YU "War is a decision with real costs. My son is a captain in the U.S. Army, and although I’ve been in Congress for four years, I’ve never had the chance to vote on where, when and how our military is deployed. We can do better." https://t.co/grdDjkX0YU The deadline to register for the Congressional App Challenge is fast approaching! If you're a student in the 4th Congressional District, I encourage you to consider competing in the app challenge this year. https://t.co/fU3POnXnh0 Today, we remember those who were prisoners of war and those who are missing in action, as well as their families. Thank you to those who pay the high price to protect our freedom. Enjoyed chatting about my time as a staffer on the Hill with Roll Call recently: https://t.co/Ij25hK73jg Congratulations to Guatemala and President Morales on the nation's 197th anniversary of independence! I was honored to visit this country last year and meet President Morales to discuss the strong friendship between our nations-we're working together for peace and stability. Glad to see that HR 5635, The Medical Cannabis Research Act, was adopted by voice in @HouseJudiciary today. This bill wisely regulates medical marijuana research and helps our veterans by allowing the VA to discuss potential medical marijuana trials with them. We reported HR 6755 out of @HouseJudiciary today, which adds another federal judge for Colorado to help with caseloads. We need to keep taxes low and regulations rolled back so that businesses in this nation can keep adding jobs. https://t.co/QaPiImYg5h Police and prisons are not responsible for violent crime. Criminals are responsible for violent crime. #HR6691 defines crimes of violence so that our criminal code is no longer ambiguous. I clarified some of these facts for my colleagues in this video: https://t.co/IbOPmJHnlf Free market policies help all industries in Colorado, including the beer industry: https://t.co/BfLG0W2Ta0 If we want economic growth and job creation, then we need to ensure the federal government decides on permitting applications in an efficient matter. That's why this markup of the Permitting Litigation Efficiency Act is so important today in @HouseJudiciary I'm competing in the Brew Across America contest with my special Brew, Rocky Melon Madness brewed at Anheuser-Busch in Fort Collins. I need your support for the people's choice award. Text Buck to 202-883-6007 as soon as possible to support this Colorado beer! https://t.co/dG9PfXOfgL Discussing my beer, Rocky Melon Madness, with the brewmasters who helped me create it. I'm excited to compete against my fellow members tonight at the Brew Across America Festival. Relying on the Rocky Ford Hirikata melons in this beer to propel us to the top. #BrewDemocracy https://t.co/hZhe0kDVf1 A few weeks ago I toured Anheuser-Busch's brewing facilities in Ft. Collins and brewed my own beer, Rocky Melon Madness, to compete in the Brew Across America Festival tonight. We'll see how my beer does tonight-the special ingredient is watermelon from Rocky Ford. #BrewDemocracy My prayers and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of the young boy lost this morning at the Harvest Parade. https://t.co/y0jd45TAAX I'm thankful for Senator McCain's many decades of service to our nation and my prayers go out to his family tonight. https://t.co/XpYeRIBmb2 I had a great meeting with members of the Longmont Chamber of Commerce this week. We talked about ways to create an economic environment for growth and job creation. Thanks to everyone who attended! @LACC528 https://t.co/XLHtXM5Lmt I’m truly saddened by the loss of Mollie Tibbetts. It is one more reminder that Congress needs to fix our broken immigration system. https://t.co/eyh3EEaFsJ I had the chance to brew my own beer during a visit to the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in Fort Collins. My recipe includes melons from Hirikata Farms in our district--so I'm sure it will be a winner in the #BrewDemocracy contest against other members later this year. #BAA2018 Thanks to everyone in Burlington who came to the listening session on Spaceport Colorado that my staff held. Please reach out to us if you weren't able to make it and have comments or concerns. https://t.co/c8WtVZKDvS We must protect the religious freedom of faith-based institutions. That's why I sent a letter to the Higher Learning Commission, asking them to withdraw recent proposed revisions to their accreditation criteria. https://t.co/Coi8xyu77B I voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because I believed it would benefit Coloradans. Here's a story of a local business that used savings from the tax reform bill to reinvest in their employees. #TCJA #TaxCuts https://t.co/d1amMcopyM "This bill makes sense. The ditch companies will benefit by being able to make additional revenue to invest in maintenance and upkeep of their operations, without putting at risk their nonprofit status, and we'll all benefit from less expensive water." https://t.co/FyNavi2sur Watch CNN in 10 minutes to hear my thoughts on the articles of impeachment filed against Deputy AG Rosenstein. We all rely on farmers and ranchers for our nation's food supply. That's why the WATER Act is so important. https://t.co/4BP1kVFGFe I'm thankful for the bipartisan, unanimous support my bill, the WATER Act, received on the House floor today. https://t.co/JIlg4H3bHj A lot of work still needs to be done to fix the VA system for our veterans. I'm excited to see Robert Wilkie start tackling these issues as he becomes the next Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. https://t.co/mYiHNgBdg3 Thank you to everyone who came to my town hall today to discuss the landmark tax reform bill. And thank you to Chairman Kevin Brady for sharing his knowledge on the bill with us. https://t.co/Y2ciqt84it We must demand a civil debate over Judge Kavanaugh’s experience and methods of judicial interpretation. We must stand by a good nominee and diligently shield him from the flaming arrows of vitriol headed his way.
https://t.co/sfCvm0VyPC President Trump has nominated an experienced, intelligent, and reasonable individual to serve on the Supreme Court. #ConfirmKavanaugh https://t.co/sfCvm0VyPC Bruce Benson has served the university and the State of Colorado with passion, distinction, and honor. His impact will be remembered for years in the hearts of the individuals he helped. https://t.co/t91aihMN23 I joined northern Colorado’s congressional delegation to send a letter to DOT Secretary Elaine Chao, urging her to consider our state’s application for a northern I-25 expansion grant. We must reduce congestion on I-25 to support our economy and preserve our environment. I signed a bipartisan letter urging DOT Secretary Elaine Chao to fully and fairly hear our state’s application for a northern I-25 expansion grant. Dense traffic on this highway costs our citizens thousands of dollars. We must find a solution. #I25 Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election are disgraceful. We should work to improve American relations with our adversaries, but not at the cost of our nation’s soul. Traffic congestion on northern I-25 costs thousands of dollars in lost productivity and increases the chance for accidents. That’s why I signed a bipartisan letter urging DOT Secretary Chao to favorably review our state’s application for a grant to expand northern I-25. #I25 I’m thankful for the chance to lead the Diversity Internship Program for Republicans in Congress, and I’m thankful for all the students who chose to participate this summer. https://t.co/1rII6HMGyX It’s unfortunate that a group of interns who are in Washington to learn about our democratic process and advance the cause of freedom and liberty faced discrimination for their political beliefs. https://t.co/glvbFT8LbV Keep the students and families impacted by this accident in your prayers. 
https://t.co/RSq3I8tNP6 I'm eager to hear the testimony of Peter Strzok in front of the @HouseJudiciary and @GOPoversight committees today. We need to find the truth and ensure the political independence and integrity of our law enforcement agencies. Great economic news today. New hires are at the highest point they've been in 17 years. Thankful for deregulation, tax reform, and other legislation that has spurred job growth in this country. https://t.co/vT1IJl8dvb After visiting Guatemala last summer, I know the important role played by Central America in combating human trafficking and illegal immigration. I’m thankful for President @jimmymoralesgt and his leadership in hosting multilateral talks on these issues. I’m excited to see Judge Brett Kavanaugh serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I urge my Senate colleagues to quickly confirm him. On this day over 240 years ago, a group of revolutionaries pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the founding of our nation. #IndepenceDay Happy #IndependenceDay! On this day, let's celebrate the birth of this free country and hold dear the sacrifices of those patriots who risked everything to protect it. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) can help those suffering from PTSD. That’s why I’m fighting to make #HBOT available to our veterans. https://t.co/xdefy3QiTn #PTSDAwarenessMonth Over 7.7 million Americans suffer from #PTSD and many of these individuals encountered trauma while fighting for our country. As we turn our attention to a week of celebrating freedom, let’s also remember those individuals who paid the cost for that freedom. #PTSDAwarenessMonth June is #AlzheimersAwarenessMonth, a chance for us to remember those we’ve lost to the disease, encourage those who are fighting it, and look ahead to a future where we can conquer it. Right now, over 5 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s, costing the nation $227 billion annually. #AlzheimersAwarenessMonth I introduced the WATER Act, legislation that makes water affordable for rural communities and agriculture--and just last week it was reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. https://t.co/c9E6LGvswF From its strong response to the 2013 floods to its focus on innovation and civic engagement, @cityoflongmont and its citizens are working to build a healthy and desirable place to raise families. https://t.co/pE9EaM1gql I'm very happy to see the City of Longmont named one of the National Civic League's All-American Cities. https://t.co/pE9EaM1gql On this day in 1788, the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Let's keep the Constitution, and the important amendments we've made to it, at the center of our policy-making for another couple of centuries. I was proud to speak on the House floor in support of three bills that will help keep opioids out of our country and assist those suffering from addiction as they successfully return to society.

https://t.co/lta5MZGsyW Happy Flag Day! Today we celebrate the adoption of the American flag by the Second Continental Congress on June 14th, 1777. The flag is a reminder of our nation's endurance and the values that our country represents. Happy Birthday to the United States Army! For 243 years, the brave soldiers of the #Army have protected our people and guarded our liberties. The men and women of the U.S. Army have secured America against many enemies, and we are thankful for their sacrifice for our nation. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act. This common sense legislation will ensure that health care professionals will not be deterred, by the threat of frivolous lawsuits, from volunteering their services during a disaster. #HR1876 Thanks to #TaxReform, businesses in Colorado are growing and adding jobs. Here is one of their stories: https://t.co/TlKcOcORCx A recent report indicates that Planned Parenthood has deliberately failed to report suspected sexual abuse of minors in their care. We must get to the bottom of this. That's why I joined with my House colleagues to request that HHS investigate the matter. https://t.co/FauZOyKLAz After working for months with a bi-partisan group of members from Colorado's delegation, I'm proud to see Colorado receiving this grant funding: https://t.co/i1GRns0C9O I’ve worked hard with fellow Colorado Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to emphasize the importance of the I-25 Gap project. Receiving INFRA Grant dollars for I-25 will make Colorado better connected, benefiting our economy and our communities. Our transportation infrastructure must meet the needs of Colorado’s growing population and bustling economy. That’s why I’m so excited that the I-25 GAP project received a large grant from the Department of Transportation. If you have a few minutes today, take a listen to President Reagan's 40th Anniversary #DDay speech: https://t.co/BvgNPxbuey Today, we honor the sacrifices of the heroic soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy on #DDay. Thank you to all of our veterans who have fought for our freedom. I was honored today to receive the Defender of Housing award from the National Association of Home Builders. We need to create policies that enable citizens to pursue their American dream, which often includes home ownership. Today, we memorialize the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Who went off to fight in a war and never returned. Who gave their lives for the ideals we cherish. Happy #MemorialDay and thank you to those who have served. If you're a student in the 4th Congressional District, I encourage you to participate in this year's app challenge. We've had some great apps the last three years, and I'm looking forward to seeing what students create in 2018. https://t.co/wJBrMujG66 Last week, the House passed a bill allowing for federal prosecution of individuals who target police officers for violence. #NationalPoliceWeek Last week, the House focused on legislation aiming to protect those men and women who put on a badge every day. #NationalPoliceWeek Americans are confident that it's a good time to find quality jobs in this country. We need to continue supporting policies in Washington, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that promote job creation and business growth. https://t.co/aRpOw9CQc1 I'm praying for all those impacted by the tragic events in Texas today. Thank you to those first responders who bravely arrived at the scene. When small business succeeds, so does our economy and our community. That's why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was so important: https://t.co/Ude8EHk0hT Today, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our families safe.

Here are a few of my thoughts on Randy Bangert, in the newspaper he helped shape: https://t.co/l4f70byve7 Every student learns differently. Our education system should reflect this diversity. That's why Charter Schools are so important. #NationalCharterSchoolWeek I had a chance to question the acting administrator of the DEA yesterday about the link between sanctuary city policies and the #opioidcrisis. We need all levels of law enforcement working together to fight this problem.

And Colorado saw 159 heroin overdose deaths in 2015. We must find solutions to this epidemic, which is why this @HouseJudiciary hearing on the #opioidcrisis is so important. Headed to a @HouseJudiciary hearing on the challenges and solutions of the opioid crisis. Watch live here: https://t.co/ICtxGSd8bX Colorado plays a big role in American space exploration.

Vought's confirmation is a win today for #ReligiousFreedom. https://t.co/Dhg9doQn4K Enjoyed visiting with rare disease legislative advocates who stopped by my office in Washington this week. https://t.co/mqjw5bVoXE Thanks to Jim Hartshorn and Robb Smith from the American Legion in Colorado for stopping by this week to discuss veterans issues with me. https://t.co/q6RMKMpcWj As Rev. Billy Graham lies in honor at the U.S. Capitol today, we have a chance to reflect on the way he served both God and our nation during his lifetime. 
https://t.co/JCMKQSXpEH Having a great chat with @gail1310kfka right now. Tune in to catch the end! Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, a typical, middle-income family of four in CO-04 will see a tax cut of $2,708. https://t.co/iVI5tHpaAH Here in a @HouseJudiciary subcommittee hearing for an important discussion on competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Wondering how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will impact your family? Learn more here: https://t.co/iVI5tHpaAH Sanctuary city policies are preventing local police from working with federal authorities to remove illegal immigrant heroin traffickers from our streets. This needs to change.
https://t.co/Yk5l9EgG8G Local authorities should be allowed to work with federal authorities to combat the opioid crisis: https://t.co/NpPoBcOL9b Thinking about Billy Graham this morning. While our savior welcomes him home today, we remember the zeal, passion, and counsel he offered during his time with us. We will miss him. Today, we've had the chance to remember the many individuals who have so deeply impacted this nation during their time in the Oval Office. I thank everyone who has made the sacrifice to fill this often grueling position in our government. #PresidentsDay2018 "If we’re going to win this war against drug trafficking, then we must work together. Local, state, and federal authorities are stronger in unison, and we need as much strength as we can garner to fight one of our nation’s most pressing problems." https://t.co/RWbdIxWh5T Everyone needs to be on the same team if we're going to win this fight against heroin trafficking. https://t.co/TfsijLVIQY “These are people who could be sent home but instead are sent back to sell more opioids to more people.” - @JessicaV_CIS. Local officers should be able to work with federal authorities to keep heroin traffickers out of this country. Law enforcement witnesses at this hearing agree that authorities at all levels need to work together to fight this heroin trafficking epidemic. @HouseJudiciary Sanctuary city policies are often allowing illegal immigrants with drug charges to avoid ICE detainers, sending criminal aliens "back to the streets to keep working for the drug trafficking organizations." - @JessicaV_CIS "Sanctuary policies can act as a magnate for foreign criminal organizations, because they know that immigration violations will be overlooked..." - @JessicaV_CIS "They're being handcuffed." Detective Nick Rogers explains how he and his fellow officers feel about the Denver ordinance that prevents DPD officers from working with federal authorities to fight illegal immigrants who traffic in heroin. We're holding an important @HouseJudiciary Subcommittee hearing today on heroin trafficking and the way sanctuary city policies prevent local law enforcement from working with federal law enforcement to fight this opioid crisis. I'm devastated to hear about the tragedy in Florida. Praying today for the students and all those impacted. The 4th District’s Congressional Art Competition has begun. High School students in the district are all encouraged to submit their best artwork! The winning piece will be exhibited in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/XV2WC168lU On Ronald Reagan's birthday, I like to reflect on one of my favorite quotes of his. "Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction..." he explained. By fighting for freedom in this generation, I hope to pass on those values to the next. #Reagan Are you a high schooler in the 4th Congressional District who wants to have your artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for the next year? Then check out the Congressional Art Competition: https://t.co/zBkp24FOJ0 I’m grieved tonight by the loss of another Sheriff’s deputy in the line of duty, as well as the injury of several other members of law enforcement. Praying for Deputy Flick’s family, friends, and fellow deputies tonight. https://t.co/KNcLaNYUKx I recently co-sponsored the Rural Broadband Permitting Efficiency Act. This important legislation makes the process for receiving a permit to deploy broadband infrastructure in rights-of-way more efficient, making the deployment of broadband in rural Colorado even easier. Today marks the start of Black History Month! https://t.co/FxVVUWfDc0 I’m eager now to build on this momentum and work with the administration on important policy initiatives like border security, immigration reform, reducing government spending, and military readiness. #SOTU We’re already seeing the economic benefits of deregulation and of the job-creating tax reform package passed last year. #SOTU Staff Sergeant Justin Peck’s courage is a model for us all. Thank you for your service, Sergeant Peck. #SOTU Thank you Ryan and Rebecca Holet, for seeing the value of human life and adopting a child of the opioid crisis. We need to continue addressing this crisis in our nation. #SOTU The landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already paying off with numerous companies offering bonuses and pay raises as a result of the legislation. https://t.co/z3zRLPmLum Thankful for an incredible Supreme Court pick last year in Justice Neil Gorsuch. #SOTU
