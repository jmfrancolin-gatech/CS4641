After our rail tour this morning, I joined members of the NJ delegation urging @USDOT to move forward on the environmental review process. https://t.co/llgrQ7nulh Every delay, every deferred decision on the Gateway Project that puts politics over the people of this region is a danger to NJ commuters and to our economy. I will be talking what I saw back with me to Congress to continue to fight for the Gateway Project. Currently, there‚Äôs only two hours of maintenance a night. Work crews have to bring in all equipment by train and turn off overhead wires. It‚Äôs just not enough time to maintain in place. Inspecting the Hudson River Tunnel, badly damaged by Superstorm Sandy. You can see the pitting in the concrete and the water damage. We‚Äôve had some cable faults and there is exposed rebar. https://t.co/W8w54odXjb The 118-year-old Portal Bridge carries 450 trains a day over the Hackensack River.
