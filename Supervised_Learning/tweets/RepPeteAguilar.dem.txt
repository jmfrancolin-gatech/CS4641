John Dingell’s lifetime of service helped drive a century of progress in America. This is a heartbreaking loss for the entire country, and my thoughts are with my friend @RepDebDingell during this difficult time. https://t.co/xFSrPouDCu Our bipartisan bill will not only expand environmental conservation, it will also create jobs in the Inland Empire. Proud to have worked with @RepPaulCook on this local priority, and grateful to have the support of @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris. https://t.co/e2cFXzKKAl This week, I responded to a 13-year-old in our community who wrote to me, “People deserve the right to work without being afraid the government might shut down.”

He’s absolutely right. I told him I’ll continue working to ensure we avoid another senseless shutdown. #DearPete https://t.co/Kw0cFM4bk2 Honored to be joined for tonight’s #SOTU by Sr. Hortencia Del Villar, Director of Social Concerns of the Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino and immigrant-rights advocate. Few people are more dedicated to equality and justice within our community. https://t.co/QUhUto6LCR Let's be clear - @realdonaldtrump's failure to fulfill a campaign promise does not constitute a national emergency. It's time for him to let Congress do our job and provide funding for smart, effective solutions at the southern border. #SOTU https://t.co/pBYu6Iy2Ue On this day 106 years ago, Rosa Parks was born.

Investments in technology at our ports will stop these types of shipments in the future. @realDonaldTrump's wall will not. https://t.co/f6jVDpYRAk As members of the conference committee, our job is to worry about the facts, not semantics. I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to find evidence-based, effective solutions to help enhance security at our southern border. https://t.co/DHdmZBWs36 RT @NPRinskeep: On @MorningEdition, @RepPeteAguilar says "if left to our own devices" lawmakers would negotiate border security, "we're not… By utilizing technology at our southern border, we'll be addressing a modern problem with modern solutions.

One of my first jobs was working as a Head Start teacher’s aide, where I learned that we have a responsibility to ensure that every child has an opportunity to succeed. Years later, I took that lesson with me to Congress. https://t.co/tu4KH0HxLJ I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find smart solutions that will enhance security at our southern border while upholding the values that make our country great. I look forward to getting started. https://t.co/0dxMsQZril Bill dedicated much of his life to our community, and his legacy of service won’t soon be forgotten. It was an honor to know him and to work with him to address regional concerns. My thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time. https://t.co/dnB9eNrqSC Moving forward, it is my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to reach an agreement to enhance border security through evidence-based solutions. I look forward to being a part of those efforts. I’m glad that the president has finally decided to end his disastrous shutdown, but hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many here in the Inland Empire, suffered needlessly for 35 days because of his refusal to compromise on his demands for a border wall. “Each missed paycheck is another two weeks that my daughter will go without medication and treatment.”

Graciela’s is one of the many #ShutdownStories that I’ve received from our community since the president shut down the government. People are hurting. Time to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/xP8K3cfQai RT @RepSherrill: I’ve been named @HouseNewDems Freshman Whip — and who better to break down exactly what that means than NDC Whip @RepPeteA… #tbt https://t.co/pNIs8hqYHP Joined my friend @RepDarrenSoto to serve meals to federal employees @WCKitchen.

It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to #EndTheShutdown and open the government. https://t.co/gP08Z7kumC I’m in Washington this week voting with my House colleagues to #EndTheShutdown, but I made sure I had some time today to take questions from students at @OrangewoodHS in Redlands. Thanks for letting me crash your class Ms. Wilson! https://t.co/9hOVl7PPE6 RT @akamzzdub: Video conference taking place with my Government students today! Thank you so much @RepPeteAguilar for connecting with us! @… Dr. King dedicated his life to building a better, more just future. Today as we remember his life, let us honor his legacy by committing to the pursuit of that better future. #MLK2019 https://t.co/M380FbpX1m If @realDonaldTrump is serious about reforming our broken immigration system, he needs to re-open the government. Once the shutdown is over we can start negotiating. Hopefully he won’t walk away from the table again. The president has never been a reliable negotiating partner, and this administration has always been more interested in cutting legal immigration and separating families than actual reform. Thank you to everyone who's reached out to share their shutdown stories so far. If you or someone you know has been hurt by this shutdown, please visit this link to learn about available resources. 
https://t.co/DnzVezegST From lowering the costs of health care and prescription drugs, to making sure we invest in our crumbling infrastructure, the priorities of the Inland Empire are the priorities of the American people. I look forward to this opportunity to make sure those priorities are addressed. https://t.co/Ntgf6CiINU The House has passed bipartisan bill after bipartisan bill to re-open the government, but @realDonaldTrump refuses to act. It's time to stop playing politics with people's lives and #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/fPZjHTWVdl Thousands of American families, including many throughout San Bernardino County, are suffering due to the government shutdown. If you or your family have been affected, I'd like to hear your story.
https://t.co/J8CZ1i9jR5 There are effective ways to make sure our southern border is secure — building @realDonaldTrump's wall is not one of them. 

Thanks to my friend @RepScottPeters for the much-needed dose of common sense. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/Gq0u5IobpR Pick a lie. https://t.co/iD7MrES92g While House Democrats are passing bipartisan bills to re-open the federal government, @realDonaldTrump won't even stay at the negotiating table. It's time to stop hurting innocent Americans and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/ILZoZmzg4X Shutdowns have real consequences. Americans are suffering, and the president doesn't seem to care. This week, the House will continue to pass bills to re-open the government. @realDonaldTrump should follow our lead. https://t.co/oUe7yI38j0 Threatening to withhold disaster aid after our state was devastated by wildfires is a disgusting new low, even for this president. https://t.co/q6we4YGtTe Last week the House passed bipartisan legislation to re-open the government, but California families are still going without paychecks because @realDonaldTrump refuses to come to the table. It's time to do the right thing and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/cjPDleF6mK More than 30% of federal employees are veterans, but @realDonaldTrump is willing to withhold their paychecks indefinitely because Congress won’t waste billions of dollars on a border wall. It’s time for him to stop playing politics with people’s lives and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/cKt9UCuvSg Day 1: Swear in the most diverse Congress ever &amp; pass two bipartisan bills to re-open the government .

I'm proud that we're another step closer to creating a permanent reminder of his legacy in his hometown of San Bernardino. https://t.co/1zIahBUWVI It's absurd that @HouseGOP decided to spend today voting to gut the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. America's wildlife should be regarded as one of our greatest national treasures. I voted against this backwards proposal because I believe we should work to #StopExtinction. When we give our young people a platform to make their voices heard, incredible things can happen. I'm proud of all the students using this program to affect change in our community.

To all of the veterans across #CA31 and throughout the country- thank you. #VeteransDay Grateful for the opportunity to participate in a town hall discussion with Giroux Glass San Bernardino employees. The decision to transition to an employee-owned company demonstrates their belief that when employees succeed, the company succeeds. https://t.co/NwslKO16UL Don't believe Republicans when they say they support coverage for pre-existing conditions. @NBCNews says the claim that Republicans are the defenders of people with pre-existing conditions "the biggest whopper of them all."

❌22,000 people with pre-existing conditions risk losing their coverage, being charged more, or having their coverage denied altogether
➡️You can check the numbers here https://t.co/R0BBbBClCq. 3/4 If the Trump Administration is successful, insurers can start denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or charging them more. What does that mean for people in #CA31? It means Inland Empire families will pay much more.  ⬇️ 2/4 Republicans have been sabotaging the Affordable Care Act for the last 2 years, driving premiums up for working families. After Republicans in Congress tried and failed to repeal the ACA, the Trump Administration sued to end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 1/4 Great news for Inland students from @SBCCDofficial https://t.co/s2l7yUxzhg Good news that @Starbucks is offering all employees back-up subsidized child and adult care, if their regularly-scheduled care is unavailable. It’s a step in the right direction and helps ensure that employees won't have to worry about caring for a loved one or keeping their job. Manufacturing is at the heart of the Inland Empire economy. By supporting job training and education programs, we can continue to connect Inland Empire residents with good paying jobs right here in our community. #MFGDay18 https://t.co/lMyi3HkHO6 #HispanicHeritageMonth isn't just about honoring our past, it's also about recognizing the contributions Latinos are making to their communities each and every day.

The American people deserve a thorough FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh’s alleged conduct.

I encourage all eligible Dreamers to apply here → https://t.co/7xWJnJR5As A full year has passed since @realDonaldTrump ended DACA, and in that year Congress has failed to take any action to #ProtectDreamers. We could solve this problem with bipartisan solutions if @HouseGOP leadership had the courage to pursue them.

By working to support our local manufacturers, we can ensure there are good-paying jobs in the Inland Empire for years to come. Thanks to @TPGpipe in Rialto for the tour and for talking to me about how we can continue to grow our local economy. https://t.co/NF1yBaafvX It's absolutely heartbreaking to hear about these tragedies in our community.

https://t.co/r61DOMMHd0 Communities like ours rely on small businesses to create jobs, but the burden of student loan debt has made it hard for entrepreneurs to get their businesses off the ground. My new bill seeks to change that. https://t.co/FeDGtBF4eR Earlier this summer I kicked off my #TacoTuesday tour with some shredded beef tacos at Super Burrito in San Bernardino. I'll be hitting up local taco spots to spend more time with business owners and people from our community to hear more about the issues affecting IE families. https://t.co/8IWMIGKxNK While working families in communities like ours haven’t seen a wage increase in years, the president is planning to give yet another tax cut to millionaires.

If you still have questions about Medicare, Social Security, or local resources for Inland Empire seniors, please reach out to my office at 909-890-4445. https://t.co/EJUy4zn8w8 We know that @realDonaldTrump’s #SCOTUS nominee will pose a direct threat to a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. I’m proud to #CommitToRoe to defend the access of women across the country to the health care services they need. https://t.co/bjTGkYT7RF This heartbreaking story is another example of the lasting damage @realDonaldTrump’s cruel policies have inflicted on children.

 https://t.co/8Vn3T6IkdU Today the House passed my bill to honor the memory of Jack H. Brown.

If you or a senior you know has questions about health or nutrition programs, or needs help with a federal agency, please stop by my 2018 Senior Fair! https://t.co/dqwGPBP0Kc Any policy that instructs our government to lock up innocent children is a bad policy. Today I urged my colleagues to vote down an amendment that would allow @realDonaldTrump to continue jailing children at the border, but Republicans passed the amendment anyway. https://t.co/c1JzzUCH1w Loma Linda University offers world-class medical &amp; dental education right here in the Inland Empire. I'm proud to announce this funding, which will help them carry out their mission of providing high-quality dental training while also serving our community.https://t.co/3PwVZj68Kc This is as infuriating as it is heartbreaking. These parents should not have to wait another day to see the children @realDonaldTrump took from them, but they’ll be forced to due to his administration’s incompetence and cruelty. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/Xx5QdgRz8a I respect the right of our local officials to make this decision, but I hope that DA Ramos, DA-elect Anderson and the Board of Supervisors can all agree that these actions have disqualified Mr. Selyem from government service. We cannot allow racism and bigotry to have a place in our society, especially not in our government. The comments made by Deputy District Attorney Michael Selyem are unacceptable, and he should be fired immediately. https://t.co/yC5nn9gTSe From my family to yours, happy #IndependenceDay! https://t.co/9gpqQyFKZ4 Leonardo is a great example of the passionate, bright and talented students we have in the Inland Empire. It was an honor to host him at the Capitol last week, and I'm proud that I'll be able to see his work in the halls of Congress for the next year.
https://t.co/q6cJwBkTbK https://t.co/pxGCinNbmk This additional funding will not only help us meet the growing challenges of cyber threats to our national security, but will give more students from communities like the Inland Empire the chance to begin their careers in this important field. https://t.co/kRRenl1Hlf .@HouseGOP brought two partisan bills to the floor this week that proved they have no interest in reuniting families or shielding Dreamers from deportation. These problems require bipartisan solutions, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work across the aisle to solve them. https://t.co/yrv00aop1X The Inland Empire knows all too well the tragedy that can result from an act of domestic terror. That's why I'm proud to introduce the PREVENT Act, my new bill to identify, respond to, and prevent future attacks on our communities.
https://t.co/0F5GfVIpkV I’ll continue standing with @AFSCME, @SEIU, @NEAToday, @AFTunion, @AFGENational, and the entire labor movement for workers’ right to organize so they can support their families. #Union https://t.co/uWox0bmXb3 From higher wages to better health care, #Unions give a voice to those demanding change in a rigged system. This decision is a major blow to working families across the country, but we won't let it stop us from standing together for a brighter future. 
https://t.co/RhlyPDpAJM This is why we introduced the bipartisan #USAAct with @HurdontheHill and @RepLujanGrisham. Americans are ready for Congress to step up and provide solutions to #ProtectDreamers, and we’re going to need to work together to get it done. https://t.co/gU7ApkZrfm This bigoted policy goes against the values that make America great. We can’t allow today’s decision to deter us, and we have to keep fighting discrimination in all its forms. 
 https://t.co/tHwhDZ6mvM Head Start is a critical resource for working families in the Inland Empire. I'm proud to announce this funding which will help to ensure that every child in our community has access to high-quality early education programs.
https://t.co/1tZlBUrdtw The opioid epidemic has hit every community across our country, including our own. I’m proud to have helped pass a bipartisan legislative package to combat this crisis.

Despite support from both parties, @HouseGOP just killed our discharge petition to start an open debate on DACA. This was our best chance to pass a real, bipartisan solution. Why is Republican leadership so afraid to debate bipartisan bills? https://t.co/Z6ab5ZbocP Always great to have Inland Empire students in DC, especially when they pretend to laugh at my jokes. Thanks to @LomaLindaAcadem for stopping by the Capitol today! https://t.co/7KYQZIbuoP Happy to lend you a pen, @RepMarkMeadows. https://t.co/VcoSMql6Ym I applaud this bipartisan rejection of the president's attempt to strip billions from programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's shameful that President Trump would try to cut essential services to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires. https://t.co/xQJ03BZO8G The president's family separation policy is a violation of human rights, and I won't stand by while @realDonaldTrump continues to tear families apart. That's why my Democratic colleagues and I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to end this policy. https://t.co/of2mNE7Xrg On #Juneteenth2018, we celebrate 153 years since the downfall of slavery in the United States. As we reflect on how far we've come, let us also reflect on how far we still have to go in the fight for equality and justice for all. https://t.co/EbG4iWbT8K The OPPORTUNITY Act, my bill to connect a diverse pool of students with the @DeptofDefense Cyber Scholarship Program, passed the Senate last night. Thanks to @MarkWarner for helping to make sure that the US has the world's most elite cyber defense force. https://t.co/ckLa0gW7z6 Nominating students from our region to attend US Service Academies is always an honor. If you know an Inland Empire student who is interested in applying to a service academy please visit my website. https://t.co/OLry7NFU4U Congratulations to Adam Gomez of Grand Terrace and David Lopez of Rancho Cucamonga, who will attend the US Naval Academy, and to Aidan Christensen from Rancho Cucamonga who will attend @WestPoint_USMA. I'm proud to have these outstanding students representing our community. https://t.co/q2en3huFgJ This Father’s Day, thousands of parents are missing their children who were ripped away by the Trump Administration. As the father of two young boys, I can only imagine the pain this policy has caused. @realDonaldTrump, reverse your cruel policy and #KeepFamiliesTogether. https://t.co/psZezcxR3k Small businesses are the foundation of the Inland Empire economy, and microloans can play a major role in helping them succeed. I'm glad my office was able to help business owners in our community connect with this critical resource.
https://t.co/ATKcB2vSVp Today, six years after the creation of the DACA program, I joined my colleagues to say that despite President Trump’s hateful policies, we’re not giving up our fight to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/F0IX91LVuX Republicans have a chance to claim control of this process by signing the discharge petition TODAY. Only 2 signatures are needed and we put all these bills on the floor. https://t.co/bcOZzPLbsA Proud to represent @valleycollege, @UofRedlands, and #CA31 in today’s bipartisan #CongressionalBaseballGame for charity. https://t.co/DE3soYDKWI DACA recipients serving in the US military deserve to know that they’ll be able to continue living in the country they took an oath to defend. Unfortunately, Republicans voted yesterday to kill my amendment to protect these service members from deportation.https://t.co/E6tRMXtr5T RT @WhipHoyer: For months – 281 days to be exact – @SpeakerRyan has promised to address the #DACA crisis created by @POTUS. Instead, he has… Unfortunately, @HouseAppropsGOP voted to kill the amendment. I will continue fighting to ensure that DACA recipients who defend our nation through military service can continue the lives they’ve built here.
https://t.co/TYIPde4OGJ Earlier this year, Secretary Mattis said that the brave DACA recipients who choose to serve our country in the armed forces would not be at risk for deportation. Today, I offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to codify those words. #LetDreamersServe https://t.co/yrcyF8BmRY Time’s been running out since the second the president decided to end DACA. I urge my Republican colleagues to follow Governor @JohnKasich’s advice and join our efforts to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/x8wRC5NgWO Mrs. Aguilar has to do a lot of family stuff each week, but dusting off the glove and warming me up for the #CongressionalBaseballGame wasn’t on her list. https://t.co/Hf20Wl0fgY Americans believe in standing up for the vulnerable, not sending them back into harm’s way. The kindness of the American people is not reflected by the cruelty of the Trump administration.
https://t.co/XzvaRSBKJ6 We’re three signatures away from moving forward the bipartisan discharge petition on our #QueenOfTheHill rule. It’s time to get this done and #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/ZYtbUbCLH2 Last year, we fought to stop @realDonaldTrump from stripping health care coverage from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. He’s trying again anyway. #ProtectOurCare
 
https://t.co/MsFZlum84w Great to see my friend @SteveScalise back on the field! I’m usually not okay with the other team spying on our practices, but I’ll make an exception this time. https://t.co/Ksj9pNTbI5 Protecting Dreamers shouldn't be a partisan issue. I'm grateful to leaders like @JohnKasich for standing with us as we work toward a bipartisan solution to this problem. https://t.co/eklkNX05Vz Forever grateful for the service and sacrifice of the brave service members who went into harm’s way in the name of freedom 74 years ago today in Normandy. We will never forget #DDay. https://t.co/VGP6j5d5NF During #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, we’re reminded that the American story is the story of immigrants and their search for better lives in this country. I’m proud of my immigrant heritage, and proud to live in a nation and community where we #CelebrateImmigrants. https://t.co/oCZNZEsy3d .@EPAScottPruitt spent more than $3 million on a 20-member security detail in his first year in office, an amount that is now under investigation. I’m supporting @AppropsDems amendment to ensure the IG can finish this important review. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/Uo6NsrI7OG Had a great time answering questions about Congress from Rancho Cucamonga Middle School students this morning. Thanks for visiting me in DC! https://t.co/1StcU1g1qC RT @citiesforaction: Our mayors and county executives commend the bipartisan efforts to break the impasse in Congress and bring up immigrat… This morning AG Sessions proudly described your policy to take children from their parents at the border to deter them from entering the country to lawfully claim asylum. This is your policy and you have the power to fix it. Do the right thing. https://t.co/8flgFiTbex This is just not true. @realDonaldTrump, this is your cruel and inhumane policy and you must take action to end it. Where are your family values? https://t.co/z4QeTNW3Yl Every American should be entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of sexual orientation. We must pass the Equality Act to establish clear, nationwide protections for the #LGBTQ community. 
https://t.co/yNoclXxjv0 Our bipartisan bill would provide Dreamers with a path to citizenship in the only country they’ve ever known as home. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your leadership. https://t.co/k6IJ9T9Opa Happy #Pride Month! As we celebrate the #LGBTQ community, we must also continue to stand up against @realDonaldTrump’s hateful policies of discrimination. https://t.co/fyMrXsNSCA Our country was built by immigrants and our policies should reflect that. The Trump Administration must put an end to its cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/07GWFd2unZ I wrote the USA Act with @HurdOnTheHill because Dreamers deserve a chance to earn citizenship in the only country they've ever known as home. I’m proud to support this discharge petition, which only needs 5 more signatures to bring our bill to the floor. https://t.co/SL8NUy55V9 Filling shelters with children who were ripped from their parents is not sound immigration policy, it’s outright cruel. We have to be better than this. 
https://t.co/Fm4tblPe0f Today we honor the service and sacrifice of those who gave their lives for our freedom. Thank you to all who have served. https://t.co/r50igXP8EZ Beautiful day to hang out at the Redlands Firefighter Local 1354 Car Show downtown with the little guys. https://t.co/agpy80cqcR In Case You Missed It: Last week I introduced the JOBS Act to help connect Inland Empire residents with employment resources in our community.
https://t.co/1FZcSIFc6Y BREAKING: The OPPORTUNITY Act, my bill to help ensure that students of color aren’t overlooked as we recruit the next generation of cyber defense experts, passed the House this morning. This is an important step as we work to reestablish US cyber dominance.https://t.co/UUtemJtuB0 San Bernardino County relies on the Dept. of Transportation for critical improvements to our infrastructure. We should be focused on the career public servants who make that possible, not filling the agency with political staff. https://t.co/ieC3cX87es I’m proud that this legislation to help diverse groups of students access the @DeptofDefense Cyber Scholarship Program was adopted unanimously in the House last night as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. As global cyber threats continue to increase, we need to make sure that the US has the most advanced #CyberDefense capabilities in the world. I introduced the OPPORTUNITY Act because we can’t afford to overlook any talented students when recruiting for our cyber defense programs. https://t.co/8DXsGFdyek My amendment would require the DoD to provide a 20-year estimate of the costs associated with updating our nuclear program, allowing Congress to perform its constitutional duty of providing oversight. It’s critical that we continue to modernize our military in a responsible way. https://t.co/trmGtdujUs Filling in for @ScottPetersSD as the unofficial @Padres Congressional liaison. Thanks to @AJEllis17 and @CStammen35 for stopping by for a tour, and for promising to take it easy on the Dodgers for the rest of the season. https://t.co/NbdHsrQCqh We need to use every available tool to help Inland Empire residents find good jobs in our community. I’m proud to introduce the JOBS Act, my bill to empower Workforce Development Boards to connect more job seekers to potential employers. https://t.co/Gu9VOLhfzr RT @JasonKander: Paid a visit to the office of my new friend @aguilarpete today. As a former hill intern, I can’t resist pitching in when I… This is heartbreaking. We can’t stay complacent. Congress must act to protect our kids. https://t.co/GwTpNXx7MD With 20 Republicans signed on and over 150 signers in total, we are well on our way to a successful discharge petition for @RepJeffDenham’s #QueenoftheHill rule on #DACA. Thank you to everyone who has signed on to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/oGYBcPEaHI We were sent to Congress to debate ideas and vote on solutions to the country’s problems, not sit around and duck tough issues. Today I signed this bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote on four potential DACA solutions because #DreamersDeserveAVote.https://t.co/lUXv9uIOPJ Crazy idea: We pass legislation that leads to fewer hungry kids, not 265,000 more of them. 

The #GOPFarmBill is outright cruel. https://t.co/SytsgWfOdU Hatred, bigotry and discrimination have no place in America, and we must continue working toward true equality. To the #LGBTQ community in the Inland Empire and around the country, know that I stand with you today and every day. #IDAHOT https://t.co/bNyvKM43O4 Through their countless acts of bravery, we’ve seen that Inland Empire law enforcement officials are some of the best in the country. During #NationalPoliceWeek, we thank them for their service and for the sacrifices they make for our community. https://t.co/uy4ioeQWp4 Local economies like ours in San Bernardino County rely on the contributions of immigrants, and this administration’s anti-immigrant agenda hurts small businesses like the ones in the Inland Empire. https://t.co/NTkp7YqwvJ Dreamers start businesses, raise families and pay taxes in this country, but Congress still hasn’t taken action to allow them to continue their lives here. Our #QueenoftheHill rule would change that. https://t.co/V1QAJGmsGh I had a great time teaching Mr. Grande’s senior government class at Cajon High School as the latest stop on my Job for a Day tour. Thanks again for having me!
https://t.co/repxgBSboJ Cyber warfare is one of the most serious threats to our national security, which is why I'm proud to introduce this bill to help connect students from underserved communities with Department of Defense Cyber Scholarships. https://t.co/pNM4MvfeEZ Republicans and Democrats agree that it’s time to put politics aside and #ProtectDreamers. I’m proud to support this effort to give Dreamers the vote they deserve on a legal path to citizenship. https://t.co/1Mgyazv6wr
