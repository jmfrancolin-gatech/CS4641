1- An uncontrollable debt would be an existential threat to our country.
2- There are things that we may want to do, but we simply do not have the money.

Happy 123rd Birthday, Utah. https://t.co/RVAQawbD0n üö®üö®üö® Believe it or not, one of the Democrats first actions controlling Congress is to make it easier for them to raise your taxes.

I‚Äôm a NO vote. Surely there must be room where we can find a compromise. The Democrats continue to reject offers that provide border security, including offers that take care of our dreamers.                                    https://t.co/ES2HCVlnuU The only ones who benefit from this decision are our adversaries in the region, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.  We are working with the administration to see if we can change this policy to one that will protect our vital interest in the region. Though we have always maintained a very small footprint in Syria, we have had a huge impact on humanitarian, political and military objectives.  Most troubling, if we withdraw, we leave our allies exposed and in a weakened position. I believe the President‚Äôs new policy on Syria is a mistake. Having been to the region many times, working with our partners to bring stability to a very important part of the world, I believe it‚Äôs critical for America and our allies to remain engaged. The Senate is proposing a short-term funding measure through February 8. This is a betrayal of conservative policy and, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will not support the status quo. Kicking the can down the road hurts Utah priorities. Utahns expect the federal government to fulfill its mandate to provide border security while keeping the government open and operating. I am working on striking a deal that accomplishes both. Today I joined a group of bi-partisan legislators urging the President to prioritize funding for programs that focus on mental illness, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention. https://t.co/TMgyKyKRa7 Thanks to the good people of Utah my office collected over 6,000 Christmas cards for our troops. #utpol https://t.co/vNi4xFX5np Yesterday, my legislation honoring Anwar Sadat was signed by the President.

It appears that @POTUS has secured the release of the three Americans detained in North Korea. The President and his team are making great strides. Fantastic news! We need to start this process over, reengage with Iran and our allies, and have the Senate take it up for a vote. The deal was deeply flawed from the very beginning. It has allowed Iran to expand their influence within the region, promote their ballistic weapons program, and foster terrorism throughout the Middle East. President Trump made the right decision to pull out of the Iran deal. Nice to see my friend @wolfblitzer this evening at the @UVU commencement ceremony! https://t.co/CT4t1Q6oUh @sattixslc @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke Hi Susan. The event was on my Facebook page for a week, https://t.co/TFO5fs9FQO. I'm sorry you weren't aware of it. I'm saddened to hear of the passing of former Rep. Carl Duckworth. The Duckworths are truly a foundation in Utah politics. My prayers are with their family. https://t.co/Qw5MQV4JXl #TBT one year ago today. Thank you @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryZinke for ending the abuse of the Antiquities Act and listening to local voices! https://t.co/z11mEfSkVB Now, back to the Jazz! #TakeNote About to join @ShannonBream, tune in! https://t.co/ADEA0pM5yB RT @FoxNews: .@RepChrisStewart on Comey memos: "[Comey is] trying to cast as deep a shadow as he possibly could over [@POTUS]." @IngrahamAn‚Ä¶ Jazz are playing like hard scrabble working men!!
