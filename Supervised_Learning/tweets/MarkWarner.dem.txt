Looking forward to the tweets when Senate Intel releases its final report to the public.  Likewise for the Mueller report. I’m sure in the interest of transparency, the President will want to make that public as well. https://t.co/YxCBsnyQz0 RT @TariffsHurt: Thank you again to Senators @MarkWarner, @SenToomey, @SenatorCarper &amp; @SenRonJohnson for joining our small business owners… The Trump Administration is siding with payday lenders, weakening rules that prevent people from getting trapped in loans they can never repay. They need to answer for this.
https://t.co/4god5AZJ2g RT @NPCA: One way to address infrastructure: Start with national parks. Congress has a bill to #FixOurParks called the #RestoreOurParks Act… It's deeply disappointing to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors across the Commonwealth and the country who are once again bracing for the worst. Unfortunately, what the American people got was more of the same partisan fear-mongering and one-sided demands. What I had hoped to hear from the President tonight was ​a plan to make sure our government stays up and running ten days from now, and a willingness to work with Congress to make sure that a shutdown never happens again. I’m here with my #SOTU guest, Cheryl, a federal worker who was harmed by the shutdown. I hope the President will talk tonight about how he plans to help the federal workers and contractors who are struggling to recover financially and what his plan is to avoid another shutdown. https://t.co/t3qpUwdGaP A classified report and a short press release with no details isn’t nearly good enough. We need more transparency on how our democracy is being targeted by our adversaries. The public deserves an unclassified version of this report.  https://t.co/oItr8BIkbg This is something that I'm afraid is getting lost in the shutdown debate. A lot of federal contractors are people with disabilities, and they are truly suffering after missing two paychecks. https://t.co/8avSw2p6rX Federal workers and contractors can’t afford another shutdown, and I want to make sure we keep in mind that it’s folks like Cheryl who will suffer if the President shuts down the government again. My #SOTU guest tonight is Cheryl Nazar, a nurse at the Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg.

No tweet or Oval Office photo-op can undo two years of the President’s total disrespect for the intelligence community. For federal contractors who missed a month of paychecks, the shutdown nightmare is hardly over. We’ve got to get these folks their back pay. https://t.co/OhtPbCakMG The Russian playbook is out there. Platforms must constantly be on the lookout for bad actors, particularly foreign adversaries abusing these platforms to spread misinformation and disinformation. https://t.co/yTYrSbOdCt It’s not just that Facebook paid people, including teens as young as 13, to hand over *all* of their data. It’s how they used that data. $FB needs to commit to more transparency on *everything* it is collecting and exactly how much it’s worth. https://t.co/VzJoj89W5X I introduced a bill last week called the “Stop STUPIDITY Act” that would end government shutdowns once and for all. I don’t care what you call the bill, but we need to make sure some sort of language preventing future shutdowns makes it into the final border security deal. The President has a dangerous habit of undermining the intelligence community to fit his alternate reality. People risk their lives for the intelligence he just tosses aside on Twitter. https://t.co/BfRlqcM6rd This is a breakthrough for a lot of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and other chemicals but denied their benefits on a technicality.

The workers I’ve been talking to say bills are piling up and stress is mounting as they try to make ends meet. We need the President to reopen the government while we negotiate a bipartisan border security deal. I expect that we will learn more about Mr. Stone’s campaign role, his communications regarding Wikileaks, and who else knew about Stone’s efforts. It remains essential that the Special Counsel be permitted to finish this work without any political interference. It appears Mr. Stone also lied to Congress and tampered with witnesses in order to obstruct these investigations into the Trump campaign – yet another example of senior Trump officials concealing the truth about their Russia-related contacts during the 2016 election. And, he publicly claimed on several occasions to remain in regular contact with then-candidate Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race, even after he formally departed the Trump campaign. Roger Stone and Donald Trump have known each other for nearly forty years. Mr. Stone played a key role in recruiting Paul Manafort to run the Trump campaign. Roger Stone has been indicted for covering up his engagements with Wikileaks, which U.S. intelligence officials and the Senate Intel Committee have publicly designated as a hostile intelligence service, regarding the public release of emails stolen by the Russian government. If Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross, or literally anyone in this Administration would actually meet with federal workers and listen to their stories, they’d know how insulting these kinds of comments are. https://t.co/zHkL37CGaD 16 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, just came together on the Senate floor to support a 3-week CR to reopen the government while we negotiate a bipartisan border security deal.

A lot of folks are struggling right now. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/UXgfbzYmgM RT @catoctincreek: Hey @realDonaldTrump, your #trumptariffs are killing business and costing jobs in small town America. 

Let's get back t… "None of us want the government shut down. None of us want to be working and not getting paid. Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, Green parties, all of us that work, at least at my facility, we want to get paid." #ShutdownStories https://t.co/8qdHNTb8P1 Congratulations to my friend of almost 39 years and my absolute favorite Junior Senator from Virginia @TimKaine! #SwearingInDay https://t.co/iuiR9dyBSg Another Virginia business feeling the pain from the Trump trade war: “It’s essentially decimated our European business, and it’s put our expansion on hold.” – Purcellville’s @catoctincreek https://t.co/x71gvZfCif This is…not good for our national parks, which are already facing a massive maintenance backlog. It’s past time to end the shutdown and #RestoreOurParks https://t.co/S3m9mH1crX Before the shutdown, before the pay freeze, the federal government was suffering from a lack of leadership at the top.
