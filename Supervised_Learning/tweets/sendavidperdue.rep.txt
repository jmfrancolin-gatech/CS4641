May God bless you &amp; your family. https://t.co/T3nUGuYPI5 I was proud to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. My full statement: https://t.co/Y1gAvf93au There is no doubt in my mind that Judge Kavanaugh will do exactly what he said he would do: ‚ÄúPreserve the Constitution of the United States &amp; the American rule of law.‚Äù This has proven to be a tumultuous time in Washington. Despite partisan attempts to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs character, it is encouraging the United States Senate acted decisively about the future of our nation‚Äôs highest court. RT @SenateGOP: It‚Äôs time. #ConfirmKavanaugh https://t.co/TlsFnpo2ma Let‚Äôs go Braves! #ChopOn https://t.co/7K4vuaDg49 I have twice reviewed the supplemental FBI report on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs background &amp; the allegations. There is still no corroborating evidence for the accusations made against Judge Kavanaugh. It‚Äôs time to vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. Senate Democrats have said of Judge Kavanaugh: 
He‚Äôs ‚Äúyour worst nightmare.‚Äù
He ‚Äúwants to pave the path to tyranny.‚Äù
His confirmation would mean ‚Äúthe destruction of the Constitution.‚Äù

They are clearly willing to say or do anything to stop President Trump‚Äôs agenda &amp; his nominees. One of my Democrat colleagues has urged people to, ‚Äúget up in the face of some Congresspeople.‚Äù 

Others want to see ‚Äúuprisings‚Äù &amp; have encouraged harassment.

This is unacceptable rhetoric for members of Congress.

They‚Äôve crossed a line. They‚Äôre inciting dangerous behavior. https://t.co/0AVHtGLOZW Senate Democrats have become so far removed from getting to the truth that they will stop at nothing to delay Judge Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation. It‚Äôs outrageous &amp; irresponsible. https://t.co/9CO6RtzGFb https://t.co/bpiqcqrI4S Around 2:25PM, I‚Äôm speaking on the Senate floor about Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination &amp; the rhetoric Senate Democrats have been using since President Trump took office.
