Good luck tomorrow, @ButlerBlue3!

Promising free college &amp; free insurance may be a good way to win votes in 2020, but sooner or later somebody gets stuck with the bill. https://t.co/AU1AKIHetc Last night at the #SOTU President @realDonaldTrump outlined the incredible economic difference a businessman in the White House makes.

Today, I took to the Senate floor to say what most of us know already: business is the engine that drives the American economy, not politicians. https://t.co/o20kFxcw7C I‚Äôll be speaking on the strength of the @realDonaldTrump economy on the Senate floor in 5 min. Tune in! @cspan Met some great folks from Indiana this morning at my second time joining @SenToddYoung‚Äôs #HoosierHuddle - thanks for stopping by, everyone. https://t.co/XLhPiZCMWq Tonight, President @realDonaldTrump spoke of great progress: an economy that keeps roaring, Americans going back to work at record pace, a safer nation at home &amp; abroad. I was honored to hear his vision to keep the state of our union stronger than ever by #ChoosingGreatness #SOTU ‚ÄúLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.‚Äù - @realDonaldTrump #SOTU19 ‚ÄúWe should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.

Today, I voted in support of President @realDonaldTrump's solution to address border security, immigration reform, and fully reopen our government, yet Democrats are blocking the legislation out of blind opposition to President Trump‚Äôs attempt to secure our southern border. I sat down live with @FOX59 this morning in Indy to tell Hoosiers why I'll vote today for President @realDonaldTrump's solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and reform our immigration system.
