We must make reporting and seeking care for military sexual assault easier, and we owe it to survivors of military sexual trauma to give them the support they need and deserve. I’m proud to join @SenatorTomUdall, @SenatorDurbin and my other colleagues in this effort to defend our national parks against the Trump Administration’s attacks. 
https://t.co/1ybDNOEv9e Our national monuments and public lands are essential for wildlife preservation, environmental protection and outdoor fun. https://t.co/7c9z9WBc90 Very sad news. @JohnDingell always sped by me in his scooter calling “keep up Tammy,” racing for the elevator to go cast our votes. I never won &amp; always marveled at this great public servant who was also my arch nemesis in the wheelchair elevator wars https://t.co/ZHHJ6OCpYv But rather than addressing these causes head on, the Trump Administration is slashing the budgets of many agencies that could both help address the root causes and increase security for our servicemembers overseas. At today’s Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing, our military leaders made it clear to me that the one root cause of many of the security challenges they face in South America and Africa is poverty &amp; hunger—things that cause people to search for a better life. @SenatorDurbin and I are calling on @DeptVetAffairs, @CDCgov and @EPA to participate in the Illinois Legionnaires’ Task Force to assist in investigating this potential Legionella-linked death and address this public health issue. https://t.co/kY6jej6OsX The tragic death of a Veteran that may have resulted from Legionnaires’ disease acquired while living in the Illinois Veterans Home in Manteno is a sobering reminder of the need to urgently address the daunting public health challenge posed by Legionella contamination.

He missed a critical opportunity to present credible solutions to some of the serious challenges facing our country, like our crumbling infrastructure &amp; rising health care costs. The American people are counting on their elected leaders to come together on these difficult issues. ...the President played on America’s internal divisions and employed his usual xenophobic attacks on immigrants. Instead of proposing ethics reforms to clean up Washington, he asked Congress and law enforcement to stop investigating misconduct in his administration. Tonight, we saw the same reckless rhetoric that has been a signature of Donald Trump’s presidency. Instead of attempting to unite the country and bring people together after the ridiculous and unnecessary government shutdown... https://t.co/gBKKvMmuhz I am also calling on EPA to investigate recent alarming allegations made by former Sterigenics employees that the company intentionally violated the law and put their own employees at risk. https://t.co/aqIvMZmb0D EPA must immediately tell the public whether these elevated ethylene oxide levels pose the ‘substantial and imminent threat’ to public health that, under the Clean Air Act, provides EPA with broad authority to shut down dangerous facilities. New EPA data confirms what we have feared: Sterigenics continues to pose a threat to the health of its neighbors. While it cannot undo the damage that has already been done to families in the Willowbrook area, the EPA can act to prevent further harm to our children. I’m proud to bring Lily Wu, a Chicagoan and first generation American, to the State of the Union tonight.

I will continue to hold him accountable when he fails to put our farmers first. The truth, however, is very different. Under Mr. Wheeler, EPA has continued to abuse policies meant to assist small refineries to help Big Oil companies like Exxon and Chevron--that have billion dollar profits--at the expense of the American farmer. During his nomination hearing, Mr. Wheeler claimed to be implementing the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) the way Congress intended. @EPAAWheeler has continued his predecessor’s agenda of undermining policies meant to move our country away from oil and toward renewable fuels. https://t.co/6kPYX9kF5J We must do more, it’s past time for Congress to finally fix that, and I’m working to make sure that happens. https://t.co/UufEdNo7Zt 26 years after Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, the United States is one of just two countries in the developed world that doesn’t provide working families with comprehensive paid parental and medical leave.

We can do much more to recognize and support the rights of refugees Families are fearful of flying home to see loved ones, while refugees and asylum seekers wait endlessly in dangerous situations. Turning people away from our country because of where they were born or the religion they practice is wholly un-American &amp; betrays our nation’s values. Since then, Donald Trump has time and again wrongfully characterized entire countries, faiths and peoples in pursuit of xenophobic and sometimes hateful policies. It’s been two years since Donald Trump issued his discriminatory Muslim travel ban, preventing travelers, vetted refugees and their families – and even green card holders – from entering the United States. Thanks to Donald Trump’s five-week shutdown, our economy lost billions of dollars – and he is already talking about the next one. Hardworking Americans can’t afford to keep paying the tab for his temper tantrums. https://t.co/gqZ0GS0vQZ With injustice and bigotry once again rearing its head around the world, let us pledge to never again be silent in the face of such hatred and discrimination.

For far too long, low income communities and communities of color have borne the brunt of our environmental burdens, that is why I am committed to working in the Senate to achieve #HealthyAirForAll.

Today’s decision is disheartening not only because it will help the Trump Administration discriminate against an ever-shrinking portion of our population who are willing to serve in uniform, If you are willing to risk your life for our country and you can do the job, you should be able to serve-no matter your gender identity or sexual orientation.

If Trump gets away with spending billions of YOUR tax dollars on an ineffective wall Mexico won’t pay for, ultimately Medicare will. Donald Trump’s weakness and failure has led him to break his promise of getting Mexico to pay for his ineffective wall. Mitch McConnell needs to stop protecting Trump from looking like a fool for picking a fight he can't win, and McConnell needs to let the Senate end this shutdown today. Hundreds of thousands of hardworking American's livelihoods are being held hostage by Donald Trump's ridiculous demands for billions in wall funding, and this supposed "offer" does nothing to change that. The House has now passed bipartisan bills written by Senate Republicans to end the shutdown too, but Mitch McConnell is blocking Senate votes on those same bills that he supported just a few weeks ago.

End the #TrumpShutdown now. https://t.co/KUN8x247Ir This "rais[ed] concerns about whether the protracted government shutdown is straining the agency’s ability to respond to future disasters.” Mitch McConnell can end the #TrumpShutdown today. https://t.co/W4tbpjfoOz From the @WashingtonPost: "Hundreds of government contractors engaged in disaster preparedness work for @fema were ordered two weeks ago to stop work on projects." Soon, the #TrumpShutdown will make it harder for domestic abuse victims to get the help they need to escape their abusers. Mitch McConnell needs to end the #TrumpShutdown now, and ensure services that help victims leave toxic situations remain available. https://t.co/UBq1OWEcll From @Politico: “A prolonged government shutdown means closed doors. It means survivors not being treated and assisted. It means turning our backs on victims." https://t.co/s9cKlU3JYS Donald Trump is holding our government hostage and forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to work without pay. Here are just a few stories about how the #TrumpShutdown is affecting real people: https://t.co/LuYpgujDah Read my full statement here: https://t.co/EpT1BSbpfC Not only does this undermine our ability to respond to real threats and protect American people from the next military crisis or natural disaster, but it raises the question: why is Donald Trump still holding the paychecks of federal employees and contractors hostage? Now, it seems likely that Trump will steal billions of dollars that have already been allocated to fund *critical* national defense and disaster recovery projects in order to fund his wall, which he had promised Mexico would pay for. https://t.co/JTzd9yxFrq Donald Trump has already wasted more than $130 million taxpayer dollars on an inappropriate deployment of U.S. troops to the border that forced thousands of military families to spend the holidays without their loved ones. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting people across IL like Christine, a TSA agent who is in danger of being evicted. Wasting $5.6 billion on a wall won’t help her keep her home or put food on her table. @realdonaldtrump, end this temper tantrum &amp; re-open the government. https://t.co/f7VrCBLcpn I don’t want my daughters to grow up in a country that won’t protect them from firearm violence – I refuse to accept that there’s nothing we can do. Earlier this week I joined @SenFeinstein &amp; 27 colleagues in re-introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019. https://t.co/0O1zvt29oS As tragic mass shootings become more deadly, Congress cannot simply hold another moment of silence without action – we cannot stand by while our siblings, parents and children get mowed down while they’re going about their daily lives. Enjoyed having lunch with these inspiring public servants who have protected our nation and I'm excited to work with them in the 116th Congress! https://t.co/8qcneWjdRy If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to purchase a firearm. @SenatorDurbin &amp;I joined 38 colleagues in re-introducing the Background Check Expansion Act this wk because it's long past time Congress acted on this common-sense solution https://t.co/6yHXv8sgEO 🤔 https://t.co/aTHmtl1BhT I just joined @SenatorCardin &amp; my colleagues on the Senate floor to ask for unanimous consent to vote to re-open the government immediately. Unfortunately Mitch McConnell objected. This unnecessary #TrumpShutdown is hurting our country. When will enough be enough??? My brother was a Coastie and this is appalling. It's clear the #TrumpShutdown is hurting military families and damaging our national security. The House has passed *bipartisan* legislation to reopen the government. Senate GOP should IMMEDIATELY let us vote to do the same. https://t.co/fZ35sMzADe 👀 Donald Trump made it clear: he wants to continue to hold our gvt hostage in order to extort American taxpayers into funding the wall he promised Mexico would pay for. 

When will Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans stop enabling this crisis? https://t.co/a104jzxATI Congratulations to the new legislators being sworn in to the 101st Illinois General Assembly today! I’m eager to start working together to help hardworking families across our state. From @WashingtonPost: “The furloughing of hundreds of @US_FDA inspectors has sharply reduced inspections of the nation’s food supply — one of many repercussions of the partial government shutdown that make Americans potentially less safe.” https://t.co/RFV1Ftb1hl Congress must come together and reassert itself as a coequal branch of government. It is our Constitutional responsibility to check an increasingly desperate and isolated individual who is acting more like a despot than a President. If Donald Trump thinks he can declare a national emergency where none exists to win a political fight, what’s to stop him from declaring a national emergency or invoking war powers to unconstitutionally imprison Americans based on race? I asked the Trump Administration to explain this chilling action and answer a simple question: does DOD believe that anti-canon Korematsu, Hirabayashi and Yasui represent good law? I have yet to receive an answer. https://t.co/Kc3Kf4kZ5K The Department of Defense positively cited a WWII-era SCOTUS case that allowed the government to impose mass curfews of Americans based on race. DOD didn’t do this decades ago. DOD positively cited the disgraced decision in Hirabayashi v. United States *last year* -- 2018. The power to declare a national emergency is a solemn responsibility that should never be abused by a Commander in Chief. Today, we may be debating the improper use of military construction funds, but tomorrow it could be mass internment or worse. Enjoyed meeting with General Robert Brown today to receive a briefing on the U.S. Army Pacific’s execution of the National Defense Strategy in the Indo-Pacific region. https://t.co/NZoLBhKCX4 Today, I met with @usairforce Secretary Heather Wilson to discuss Air Force readiness &amp; the critical role that Scott Air Force Base plays in enabling our military to project&amp;sustain power. As a new member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look forward to working with her. RT @NialaBoodhoo: I just spoke with @SenDuckworth. When asked about President Trump's address last night, she said: "We gave him $1.3 bln l… It’s past time for Mitch McConnell to call for a vote on the Republican-written bills—that he supported just a few weeks ago—so we can end this needless #TrumpShutdown. I’ve voted for enhanced security at ports of entry and along our borders (more personnel, better technology, etc) before and I’m willing to again. The #TrumpShutdown is threatening our national security. TSA officers all over this country are not receiving pay and struggling to cover their basic needs – we must focus on re-opening government and keep them on the job, not wasting taxpayer money on an ineffective wall. Whatever #AlternativeFacts Donald Trump uses tonight, here’s the truth: Trump is holding our government hostage to extort taxpayers and break his campaign promise that Mexico would pay for his ineffective wall. Mitch McConnell must let us vote to reopen the government immediately This is not only adorable, but reaffirms how important it is to have parents in the workforce and in leadership positions. https://t.co/JvpM1mxL0D Instead, McConnell &amp; GOP Leadership are having us vote on bills that the State + Interior Depts would carry out, but they’re REFUSING to bring up legislation to open those depts &amp; bring back employees who have been furloughed. Getting the gvt back up &amp; running should come FIRST Enough is enough. The #TrumpShutdown is punishing the American ppl. Getting the government back open and running must be our top priority and Mitch McConnell must let the Senate vote on bipartisan legislation to make that happen. Yesterday, I toured @Wiegeltoolworks factory in Wood Dale, with third-generation owners Aaron, Erica &amp; Ryan Wiegel to discuss workforce development, career &amp; technical education. I also enjoyed meeting Keith, a Veteran and apprentice who learned toolmaking after his Service. https://t.co/sMNBBfwnSA I agree with @SenatorDurbin, the #TrumpShutdown impacts all of us. Shutting down the Peoria Ag Lab and not paying employees halts important research into antibiotic resistant bacteria and harms Illinois’ public health, our communities and our farms. https://t.co/ptoSCgqYFM I’m proud to introduce the Lincoln National Heritage Bill with @SenatorDurbin to honor his legacy while also bringing new opportunities for economic growth to local communities across central Illinois. President Lincoln is a true American hero who expanded freedom and liberty for many. Our democracy would not be what it is today without his leadership. https://t.co/q3xbmVZ6WS RT @Charlienews: @SenDuckworth worries that @realDonaldTrump undermining homeland security with #shutdown that could drive @TSA workers fro… What a great way by @SpeakerPelosi to honor the legacy of the ADA and celebrate the rich diversity of the newest class of Congress by having @JimLangevin preside over the first day of the new Democratic majority in the House. https://t.co/IvWjAYTMh3
