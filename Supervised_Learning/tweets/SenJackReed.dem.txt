https://t.co/e3JcrJo82C Pres Trump doesn’t seem to understand that Republicans control the Senate &amp; set the voting agenda. All he has to do is ask Majority Leader McConnell to call a vote &amp; the full Senate could pass a bipartisan bill tomorrow to end the #TrumpShutdown.
https://t.co/eGozJoTa3T The Senate could quickly end the #TrumpShutdown If Senate Republicans simply allow an up or down vote on re-opening the gov’t. A clean CR could pass with strong bipartisan support. Pres Trump should stop pouting &amp; encourage his party to vote instead of just shutting down gov’t. Democrats support smart #bordersecurity &amp; a whole of gov’t approach to public safety. Trump’s demand for ‘wall or nothing’ is making our country less safe &amp; wasting billions. Republicans should put protecting Americans above protecting Trump and allow Congress to vote. The #TrumpShutdown by the #s:
 
$5.7B - amount Trump just decided he wants as a down-payment for his wall.
 
$3.6B - amount shutdown has already wasted.

The American people deserve better With Frank Coletta on @NBC10 discussing need to reopen government &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown Pres Trump is struggling to govern &amp; his Administration is in constant disarray. He listens to right-wing pundits instead of real experts. No one around him tells him hard truths without fear of reprisal. Trump &amp; his inner-circle are doing a real disservice to the nation. Better question: How can the Republican party condone this?https://t.co/YMLQE1CIX6 Senate Dems just asked to bring up a bill reopening government, but Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) objected.

 https://t.co/ejekWTVMJu RT @MikeEmanuelFox: Top Democrat on Armed Services Committee @SenJackReed says: “President Trump continues to ignore basic facts and demons… Pres Trump’s decision to promote Mr. #Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, means #EPA will continue to operate under a toxic cloud. Americans deserve an EPA Admin. who is committed to protecting environment &amp; public health, not one who continues same harmful agenda as Mr. #Pruitt. Pleased to welcome iXblue Defense Systems &amp; 20+ jobs to new HQ in #LincolnRI, where they’ll be closer to manufacturing facilities in #Cranston.

When disaster strikes, Americans come together to help. Federal gov’t must provide needed disaster assistance to fight fires &amp; rebuild. The Trump Admin &amp; Sec #DeVos have put the interests of for-profit schools ahead of #students &amp; #veterans. It’s time to start changing that. Here’s our letter urging them to do more to cancel #studentloan debt for disabled veterans. https://t.co/PFe2C6R8vO RT @alicearose: @SenJackReed thank you for your service and joining @BrownandProv for our inaugural Veterans Day forum https://t.co/6Xhl0xH… From the @Projo archives: @mooneyprojo recounts the October day in 1916 when "a German submarine laden with torpedoes sailed boldly unannounced into Newport Harbor."
https://t.co/ObpEcDtGak Today is a day of solemn remembrance.
100 years after the #armistice, we honor those who fought so bravely in #WWI &amp; all #veterans.
Let us endeavor to be worthy of their sacrifice; Rise to match their courage; &amp; Build a more peaceful, free, &amp; just future they fought for. Today, Pres Trump chose to stay at his hotel rather than join other world leaders in paying respects to fallen servicemen who gave their last full measure fighting on behalf of our grateful nation. Learn more about brave Americans buried at #AisneMarne: https://t.co/CFWudrggN9 Pres Trump’s failure to pay his respects to U.S. troops killed in #WWI is disgraceful. Our troops made the ultimate sacrifice on the field of battle, meanwhile Trump wouldn’t even sacrifice a few minutes in light rain to join other world leaders. Lack of respect &amp; leadership. From parades to #WaterFire to a fun-run (home run trot!), @RIMonthly has the scoop on several events to help salute #veterans this #VeteransDay2018 weekend:
https://t.co/FrxTohQ6hP Every RIer who answered the call to serve in #WorldWarII &amp; fulfilled their duty w/ honor &amp; distinction, as Benny Carbone did, is a hero in my book. These #veterans may not be household names, but they've earned their place in history. We can’t thank #GreatestGeneration enough. https://t.co/v2PV37mcQH 74 years ago, Benjamin Carbone earned several medals for his distinguished service as a ball turret gunner aboard a B-24 Liberator aircraft during #WorldWarII. Today, we honor him.

Time will not forget those who sacrificed everything in service to our country &amp; we must not forget the horror &amp; heartbreak of war. #Armistice100 https://t.co/3df6PTgluc Our hearts are w/ #ThousandOaks. We owe it to innocent victims of horrific #BorderLineShooting &amp; the 30,000+ Americans who are killed by #gunviolence each year to enact stronger #gunsafety laws. We need Pres Trump &amp; GOP to come to table &amp; help enact solutions to #EndGunViolence. Yesterday, a vast majority of Americans voted for more accountability &amp; fair oversight of the Trump Administration, not less. If Pres Trump thinks firing AG #Sessions now will prevent him from being held accountable, he is mistaken. My statement: https://t.co/avplH0iMmx Good morning &amp; happy #ElectionDay!
